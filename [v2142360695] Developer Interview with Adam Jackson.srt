00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah

49
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We

50
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
have a

51
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you haven't seen any of the other ones, Blizzard has started going on to fellow content creators channels to do live interviews in which you can ask questions primarily about season 4, but be in the end

52
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Diablo in general philosophy behind design principles and some specific questions as well.

53
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The interview starts at 1pm PST which is in approximately 1 hour for them now.

54
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We do have a pretty decent amount of questions in the rapid-fire section, but if there is anything in particular you guys really want to see and it's a good question, the me and my co-host guys who will join us shortly before the start of the podcast or interview I suppose this one is.

55
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is more an interview than a podcast we're not really going to be having.

56
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There's many conversations as much as us asking questions.

57
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I see people saying the mic needs to go up. I can boost it slightly for you guys. That's easy enough.

58
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can feel free to leave them in the chat and if we see a whole bunch of those, then we would do our best to get them added in as well.

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How's the audio levels on my end of things? Let's make sure that we have audio levels are fine and all that to start.

60
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go ahead and put them both chats. I do have both chats open, both YouTube and Twitch.

61
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are we good? How's the quality? Everyone can see everything. You guys are able to hear the intro so therefore the audio is working.

62
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Everything sounds good on your guys' end of it. Great audio thanks, peeking. A little sharp.

63
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay, you can fix that. That should fix that a little bit there. Remove the threshold a bit, attenuation.

64
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How is that? Is that work a little bit better for you guys? Should be slightly better there.

65
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Ask what we have to load every player's stash items. We're going to try the stick to questions that are going to provide useful bits of information or things that could potentially come to the game.

66
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We're not really going to ask a lot of questions that don't really do anything for the player base at the moment if that makes sense.

67
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We're not going to ask when do we get another stash tab questions like that? Pretty much going to be avoided.

68
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We're going to be trying to ask more like what is either the development process behind this or what is the potential for updates related to this.

69
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Excelerate once you spoil all the questions that we're going to have. We're going to try to avoid useless questions as much as possible.

70
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Basically, as some of them can not be so useful.

71
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
With that being said, if for the people that saw Riker and Rax's interview, you guys like the reviews, I watch both of them. They seem pretty good in the interviews.

72
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Looks like Riker gave us more of like design philosophy. Rax kind of had more particulars about game play type of stuff. It seemed like.

73
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
How am I doing? I'm doing pretty good. Not live on Twitch. We're live on both platforms. YouTube as well.

74
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So you can be able to see both of them in one hour, five minutes from now. Correct.

75
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Do they plan on adding raids or raid mechanics to bosses? So this is one that has kind of come up significantly.

76
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And we do actually have raids in the rapid fire portion. So at towards the end of this, what we're going to attempt to do is shoot off a whole bunch of these.

77
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I think we have like 15 to 20 questions. We have like six major questions we're going to try to get answered, which were our primary ones.

78
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then we have a rapid fire, which is like everything from like PVP, solo cell found raids, map overlays, you know, filters, like all of the questions that people are consistently spam asking over and over again.

79
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We do have that under the rapid fire portion. So if there are some of your questions that you guys are curious about seeing that you haven't seen some of the others.

80
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If we can have enough time and get to the rapid fire portion, more than likely one of your common questions will be in that rapid fire portion.

81
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes, isn't one hour correct. Shout out to woody's and the chance wins the interview. Yeah, one hour with you.

82
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I see some other questions in here talking about skill tree skill tree was done on the previous interview with racks, though we do ask some non skill tree related build questions today.

83
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah. So like I say, we're not going to be double dipping on questions that were already primarily answered within the other interviews.

84
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We're going to try to only do new things. We're going third, we're the last of the interviews, mean, gossies. So because of that, a lot of the questions have already been answered.

85
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So if there is some of these like to give you an idea, let me poll like a common one, right, that went through previously, like asking about the nightmare dungeons, pinnacle content or like the roadmap for instance, those would have been answered in racks as interviews.

86
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So we're not going to ask those again. So if you think like, oh, there seems like to be some major questions weren't asked like when is an armory coming like that's probably in the previous interview.

87
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So just check, check those other interviews, shout out to those ones as well. If you don't see the question that you're super interested in, they might have been in the previous ones, which is why we didn't ask it.

88
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I intros nice. Oh, thanks man. That's shout out to Jim Tindow for pointing together the intros. That's my other.

89
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Can you ask them if they would add black dye? We actually do have a question related to some transmog relay questions which are to be fair.

90
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Transmogs are at the bottom of the list. I think people care more about gameplay mechanics, etc. than they care about like transmog type of questions.

91
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But we do have one of the questions that came up the chat was asking was like a hex wheel or more color chroma's, etc for transmog.

92
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So that's all the way at the bottom of the list. But if we do get to that time, then we will be asking about can we give like a color wheel for instance around transmog.

93
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So that is actually in the rapid fire portion scale, Paragon loadouts that would have already been answered in racks his previous interview, which would be which would have been yesterday.

94
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And I would recommend checking out his his interview for that one because they talk about the armory system and to just give you a pseudo answer and what the answer on that was is basically we like that, but we can't talk about it.

95
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We wink wink nudge nudge. So I don't know if that means it's coming in the expansion or something, but it seems like the potential was there.

96
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What is their vision for PVP so PVP was a highly debated topic. It was very split about half of you guys did not want us to use interview time on PVP related question.

97
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The other half was very much like, Hey, I only play the game for PVP. I understand and acknowledge there's a PVP community within this game that would like answers towards PVP.

98
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So what we did is we added PVP question like what's the plan around PVP development of it to the rapid fire portion. It didn't get one of the primary slots for the questions because all of the questions we didn't even ask stuff about classes we want to know.

99
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't have any questions in there around things that I personally wanted to know. They're all things that can apply to every player regardless of what class you're playing, regardless if you're consumer PC or how you play the game.

100
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:26,000
We're going for questions that apply to the majority of people. So I'm not going to ask like what's the plan with Druid companions. I would love to know, but that's not in there. So PVP is one of those questions that has a community that plays it, but is not like the majority of players.

101
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So for that reason, we put that into the rapid fire portion of today. So if we get into the rapid fire, we will we will be able to ask what's the plan with PVP and which hopefully we can get a few second response on that.

102
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's for the people that are just joining us not started yet. It will be we have one hour into the interview starts. We are doing the last prep for now.

103
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Guazi will join us shortly before the interview and then we will have a few moments in which we need to will probably actually go for an audio test about 15 minutes before the hour.

104
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And that way we can make sure we have the audio and everything set up. They'll be on a holding screen and then we'll pop up the interview and then we'll go from there.

105
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I do see a question related to legendary gems, charms, Paladin Diablo in Diablo for pit leader board, runes and achievements. So the pit stuff was already covered the Paladin etc.

106
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That is related to potentially the expansion, right, because there's a new class coming with expansions or I've been talked about so they can't talk about new classes. So that one we're not able to cover because they're not talking about expansion information today.

107
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Legendary gems and charms. We sort of have pseudo answered in our question or pseudo asked in the upcoming question. One of the questions we will be asking is around further development and progression of characters outside of only the skill tree as the skill tree specifically was answered in the previous interview.

108
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So we are trying to ask about that stuff today as well.

109
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
PPP is the triven true in game for the genre for certain people.

110
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Let's see what else do we have here mercenaries plan or considered. We do have a question related to pet slash followers in the rapid fire portion is pets do seem to come up pretty often.

111
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
When is the interview start top of the hour.

112
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Expansion price they're not going to be talking about shop or price related things today.

113
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Room words, room words were covered in a previous interview with Riker.

114
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So that one has already been discussed if we get into the rapid fire portion then we can for sure spend a little bit of time trying to dig deeper into that but that has been asked.

115
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And keep in mind this is a very short interview this is only 45 minutes is what we have available to us so because of the 45 minutes that we have available.

116
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We have to ask as many honed questions as we can and then get into the rapid fire which would be a little bit quicker hopefully so we aren't.

117
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Aren't able to get all of the questions today so if there's some that people are willing to see that you don't get I'm sorry for instance I see many questions about the cow level that's in the rapid fire portion but we don't have meme questions in here like I'm not going to ask him have you heard of the you know d4 bad radio you to like we're not going to ask useless questions we're trying to ask mostly things that can apply to most players at most levels basically or at least try to have the opportunity to have an answer with new information.

118
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That is our primary focus of the day and keep in mind normally mean gaussie with these tavern talks these are podcasts like the one we did with P O E for instance was almost three hours we don't have that amount of time so this is going to be a lot less of give and take of me talking with the person and more so mean guys are going back and forth shooting like here's my question here's his question and then listening to the answers acknowledging the answers then hitting again with the next question.

119
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We have six primary questions we would like to get through this evening and then after that we have like over a dozen secondary questions if we get to will be in there to ask specifically about the cow level I'm seeing a million of those the cow level is in the rapid fire portion but that's a meme question like the no dev has ever even referred to the existence of the cow level in any diablo game as far as I'm aware so it's an ongoing joke that if you ask him it'll be like I don't know what you're talking about there's no cow level so therefore it's sort of a

120
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:37,000
useless use of time for the people that are watching this interview today so for that reason we're not really going to spend a lot of time diving into the cow level group finder they didn't really ask

121
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:47,000
answer racks about it so questions that were asked but not answer them the depth of which the audience would have enjoyed will not be reiterated upon because we've already had the

122
00:18:47,000 --> 00:19:15,000
opportunity to see what they would answer that with if they didn't have an answer available for group finder and I ask him again literally the day after the same person who was just asked about group finder he's going to give us the same answer nothing has changed within 24 hours of his previous answer it would be a misuse of our opportunity of time here so for that reason like I mentioned previously questions such as group finder in which we didn't get a satisfactory answer to your liking would not be re asked as we already know how they would choose to answer it.

123
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Any bosses getting quality of life changes for season 4 we do have a question related to world bosses here which we could dive into a little bit.

124
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Scotry expansion this was covered in raxx's interview which I would recommend watching from yesterday.

125
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What about the gold level slash puzzle ring slash D3 we do have that specific question within the rapid fire portion yes actually.

126
00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why are all the devs doing interviews with streamers all of a sudden this time they're probably on a promotional run if I had to guess the expansion is coming I believe it's coming this year and season 4 is sort of a rework of reborn of the game is the word they're using for it.

127
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They're hitting up all of the content creators to talk about it it would make sense they're also probably trying to communicate better as they do seem to be trying to listen to the feedback on the feedbacks that the devs have had is that people would like more communication within the game so I think it's a two handed of it's a promotional run which I don't have any problems doing being someone who could use the interview as well as they are trying to go under the feedback that we have been giving them about communicate more to the audience I think.

128
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So when when that's how I see it anyway.

129
00:20:39,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Bag stash size so I address this earlier we're not going to be talking about stash size today are asking about stash tabs is this is one that is so well known of an issue that has been talked about and done feedback on and been represented multiple times in multiple livestreams so far so because of that it would be a misuse of our time today to talk about stash tabs we already know it's a dev technical limitation behind of it.

130
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:33,000
They've added one new stash tabs and more than likely if I had to guess the answer that would be well we know we need new stash tabs but we did just limit the amount of loot being dropped with this new loot reborn system we also have the codecs of power which is now more quality of life meaning your items are stored there meaning there will be less inventory use for you so you're kind of so they'll getting more stash space that I assume would be the answer which is the same question one of our prior or the same reason one of our primary questions today will not be about loot filters they will be in the rapid fire portion if we get to the

131
00:21:33,000 --> 00:22:02,000
same answer because I do believe we will acquire the same answer from them if we asked about stash stores and loot filter are kind of going to get the same answer the same answer would be well with loot reborn there will be a significant reduction in the amount of things you have to store and I assume that would be the answer therefore it would be a misuse of time at the moment so we're going to go with other questions it is a good question however just not for the very limited amount of time we have currently.

132
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay good they address loot filters in a video the other day true actually hardcore ssf and other game modes being looked at yes I do like that question Henry that is in the rapid fire portion it is at the top of the rapid fire portion my logic behind asking ssf modes as I know it doesn't appeal to everybody but with trading becoming larger in Diablo 4 now with legendaries being able to be trading in this season I do believe ssf has more of a place now they didn't used to be as people will want that tag therefore there's a question that we'll try to get to today.

133
00:22:32,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Five dollars from Jordan saying getting uber mats is so monotoneous and I'm mispronouncing that and people buying them is a special issue just the uber space in general can we ask them for thoughts on this so this was pseudo covered in rax's previous interview where he talked about the trading in the game which does include boss material mats as well as rm t and third party site so this was very lightly touched upon in the previous one.

134
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Now in terms of it being a labor to get uber mats we're not going to ask them if they're going to buff the rates or anything like that they seem to be pretty obvious about their intentions related to gathering the uber mats they now have up to three resplendent sparks for instance and they keep increasing the uber drop rates it seems like they already know that feedback so instead of hitting them with feedback they already know in which the answer will be that they'll tell us okay well we've done this and we've done this and this and this.

135
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
already increased super drop rates and the health hides now drop them and we have them as global drop rates etc

136
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's already pseudo answered with their actions

137
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So more than likely we're not gonna get into

138
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That one today, but I do agree with you for the record by the way that I don't like farming the materials either

139
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So I would agree with you there Jordan

140
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
under the next one

141
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Detail about the Star there's set I can ask about that on the rapid fire portion that was

142
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Something that was not entirely covered in the previous interviews

143
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It was one of the questions that Rax wanted to get to which is the folks sets as Diablo IV is trending towards Diablo 3

144
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That is our seventh question if we have time to get there about Diablo IV trending towards Diablo 3 and some follow-ups that

145
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Rax wanted to get to he was not able to so if we have enough time for that

146
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Then we we will be getting to that one as well, but that's our seventh question in line and is one of the bullet ports on this bullet points there on the seventh one

147
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
See when you ask pets can you mention mercenary specifically we have a very fast rapid fire question about pets and followers if we can get there

148
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Which is like okay pets and followers coming to the game wink wink nudge nudge pretty much like that level of question

149
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Pretty fast because when we get to the rapid fire portion there's almost 20 of these questions

150
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Can you ask if the fixed trophy achievements that are bugs specifically the exploiting one I can't platinum because of the bug that is

151
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Interesting I haven't heard that one before I will add that into the rapid fire portion now

152
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That sounds like it's specifically a ps5 prompt

153
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Maybe anyone else can confirm they have that same issue I'll add that to the bomb of the rapid fire

154
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Roomworks were partially answered in Rikers interview because we rapid fire a yes-no question for expansion

155
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I

156
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Can't ask about I would love to I can't ask about anything about expansions because they can't talk about expansion because they are

157
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Their bottleneck on being able to talk about like they're they're not allowed to discuss

158
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Expansion stuff today basically they don't have the freedom to discuss expansions so I can't talk about

159
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I can't talk about the expansion basically today. I would love to ask them more about it

160
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But we can't yet. I'm sure if the interviews are going well that what they will end up doing is doing more of these

161
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
As time goes on and as we actually get closer I would assume towards the expansion itself and which you could ask about the expansion

162
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
When is the interview it's the top of the hour so we are we're getting there

163
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Actually a few minutes before the top of our we're going to go into a holding screen so that we can get people in

164
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And get the audio balance etc

165
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Did they fix napshouting I'm probably not going to spend too much of the the limited time we have talking about

166
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Talking about bugs that could be fixed at the moment

167
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm probably going to attempt to try to get new information as opposed to reporting bugs during this as

168
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That is something that gets sent to feedback very often I

169
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
See on the twitch side of things things for the prime subs and the tier one subs

170
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I appreciate that boys and for the people doing membership etc on YouTube. Thank you

171
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Larger viewing angles what we just received the camera zoom out

172
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Seasonal themes should be account-wide. Okay, so I'm seeing feedback related questions

173
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
The keep in mind we're trying to get new information not send feedback this interview

174
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I we can send feedback at any time all of us creators are in a partner program

175
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So when people send feedback like hey, can you guys fix this bug etc a lot of times we send that instead over to

176
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The partner program where they can receive the bug you know the bug fixes and feedback etc

177
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It would be a misuse of time to just report bugs during this interview

178
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
If you can squeeze a quick pvp question during rapid fire it'd be significant for us

179
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So I talked about this earlier. I'm sure you just showed up

180
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
We are going to have a rapid fire section and within the rapid fire section

181
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
We do specifically ask about pvp for that pvp community

182
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm not a pvp Andy. There's plenty of people that aren't pvp and ease, but there are people that are

183
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So it's within one of the first I think three to four within the rapid fire question

184
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,000
We just ask very simply are there plans to further develop pvp basically to I know there's people out there that specifically play the game for pvp

185
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I know there's people that don't give a rat's ass about pvp. I understand that so

186
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I will do my best to make sure that gets fitted in if at a minimum as the very last question on this way out the door

187
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll make sure we get that one fitted in okay

188
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Thanks for the five by the way

189
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Let me pull up some more questions here. I've been reading from YouTube chat. Let me read from twitch chat here

190
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Rumble goblin poros again. We do have them the rapid fire portion

191
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We try asking me if they're going to implement a few stuff to experience in the game

192
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Which interact with streamers was streaming the game like bothers gate three did that's cool

193
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But that's more something that benefits myself personally as opposed to information that people who are all the way from casual to like

194
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Omega blasters would carry the here

195
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So I'm not going to ask things that are only relevant really to myself being a streamer today

196
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
This is going to be questions related that the general audience cares about

197
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So probably won't be asking about streamer benefits

198
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Is the obo for still a thing or just a meme should I buy it now? All right? I don't know up to you bro go look at reviews

199
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Can you ask if they plan to add rates to the game rates are within the rapid fire portion? Yes

200
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You'll ruin pusset with the five tier one gifted. Thank you, sir. Very generous

201
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Have Blizzard considered selling sharing a map editor on campaign editor more like an in-house

202
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
mod for D4 and or an instance creation that can be shared to other players

203
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So one of the points that I thought would have been interesting in season three for the vault is instead of it being a vault

204
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That we all go do and try to beat then what it actually is is a vault that you create the other players try to beat your trap vault

205
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Sort of like a mighty loot for epic or a mighty quest for epic loot if you guys ever remember that game

206
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Where you build a base the other p players rate

207
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I thought that could have been a cool pvp way of doing it as well as a cool way to have something create yourself

208
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I don't think that question in particular is actually going to make it in

209
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
To this today, but I do like where you're going with that one because I also like things like that

210
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
They'll allow you to be creative in games

211
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But I don't think a dungeon editor is going to be very high up on the list of priorities for them if I had to imagine

212
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That was talked about with Raxx for maps. I must have missed that one as I watch the interviews

213
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Can you ask if specializations for every class are going to be improved upon?

214
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
He is the class lead designer today. We do have some class related questions towards the end of it

215
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Asking them if the classes are basically going to become better isn't necessarily a great way to phrase that question so

216
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
we

217
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Might not ask it in the words that you're asking here today

218
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But we we are asking what their next focus typically is on in relation to

219
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Like class fantasy for instance, which might be a way of getting close to your specialization

220
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Ask about making sets as sets as set gyms not items so we don't ask about set items in particular

221
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But we do actually talk about

222
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Progression related two things outside of only this skill tree one of which

223
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Basically being like gyms etc

224
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Or in this game would be more referred to as glyphs

225
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Adam specifically saying Raxx interview that questions that was the next priority or better than will you do this?

226
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes, so part of our focus and our prep for the interview has been as much about wording it in a way that somebody is

227
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Is allowed to speak on

228
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,000
As much as preparing for what questions are important like we're trying to the wording of these questions have to be

229
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Making it where he can talk about it. I can't just ask him hey in the expansion is the pallet incoming

230
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Like you just can't say things like that. We will get non-answer's

231
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So we are doing our best to have our list of questions to be things that make it easy for him to have a good

232
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Conversation on the interview as opposed to locking him down and putting them in defensively

233
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Trying to make it like a good interview here

234
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Or at least attempting to

235
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Thoughts ungiving all classes equipment slot parody. I

236
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Don't think that's gonna work as a barbarian, right?

237
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You might ask him about trade board slash market would enable community engagement appreciate the 10

238
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That is something that came up in the previous interview with Raxx

239
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I do believe they said they're not gonna do an auction house if I'm remembering correctly and

240
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
We're not gonna double dip into the same questions that were already

241
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Previously asked so while I like that question

242
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I also do believe that trading I haven't made video talking about how the like trading is gonna be significantly different

243
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
going into season four that is something

244
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
That has sort of already been covered and I would be re-eathering upon the question that's already been covered

245
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Can you ask for the final temper manuals? Yes, actually that is one of our questions is related to

246
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Clarity of tempering manual changes, etc

247
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The first question is to be why does such an awesome person like you joined before that's good one. I'm sure he would love that question

248
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You know, I think for the subs. I see that a little fi high with the five tier one things buddy

249
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Appreciate them and twitch side things with the hype train going on

250
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We're gonna add new Uber Unix or update existing ones

251
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So I we're not asking are you gonna have new Uber Unix because they've already been adding new Uber Unix

252
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And so we can determine by previous information that they're going to continue that Uber Unix. It would be sort of a

253
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Throw away question

254
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Because we know that they'll be adding more they have been

255
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Can you ask him if I could hold the dollar there's some really interesting questions in here, right?

256
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Feel like I'm going to I'm getting trolled with some of these questions by the dollar for every cow level question. I'm getting

257
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Can you ask if all

258
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Ask if all pve will be pvp. I don't even know what that means I

259
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Don't know if anyone in here knows what that means. I'll be honest

260
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Pineapple on pts. Yes. No no for me

261
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Can you ask if we'll be able to craft an Uber Unique?

262
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So that is already in the game as a matter of fact you can get three resplendent sparks and

263
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You have to get a drop of the fourth one to get the fourth spark which will allow you to craft a total

264
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Uber Unique of whatever you want

265
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That being said one of the rapid fire questions was are they ever going to add a fourth spark or is the design philosophy

266
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
about

267
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Making it where you have to get the drop before you can pick the drop basically or if they would ever allow deterministic crafting the Uber Unix

268
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Shop prices and plans for singular armor cosmetics for sale so both between the expansions as well as the shop or two things

269
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
They're not gonna dress they

270
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Raxa was gonna coordinate with you with questions he wasn't able to get to are you gonna be asking about yes

271
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
We have plenty of questions from Raxa's pamphlet that he was not able to get through today shout out to Rax for being generous enough to pass along the torsions some questions

272
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That did help significantly today with prep

273
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Ask them if they're up for an AMA I'm read it

274
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
um

275
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I don't think like I don't think that's an important question

276
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I think that's an interesting one. I like that question, but I don't think that's an important use of time

277
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
If I had two hours here with gauzy where we could go back and forth and do a podcast

278
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's different this isn't our normal interview

279
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We've done lots of interviews with P.O.E. and last epoch devs. We've done plenty of these

280
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But in all of those we had two the three hours

281
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
This is 45 minutes

282
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So this isn't going to be so much a conversation or a use of everything I want to know as much as like what can we

283
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Cram in to this 45 minutes. It's it if you've seen the previous interviews you know they are short

284
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So we're doing what we can to the priority for it

285
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Now put priority for questions seems you have too many we only have six that are high priority the rest are rapid fire

286
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, so we have actually put them in the priority list assuming that we don't get through all of them

287
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
We did that this morning

288
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Think of the sub-sert

289
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I need you to ask a simple question about clans please it doesn't need the complete rework all of this does how long is so and self-lying we command the clan

290
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah, I did see that question actually yesterday as a matter of fact during practice interview people were asking about that in the chat

291
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So I will actually put that in the rapid fire portion for you hog

292
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Now put it in the top five of the rapid fire for you sure

293
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Uh, did you pass those six questions to Adam already yeah, we pretty much said hey, here's your prep like these of the questions we're gonna ask and

294
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
We haven't changed or removed any of them other than the charms question because charms are just something that

295
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Is not able really to be spoken spoken speaking spoke

296
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Upon so thanks our useless waste of time that he can't talk about have been removed and we only have one of those which is basically charms

297
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Other than that everything's remain the same

298
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
The M. Can you begin streaming on YouTube streaming on YouTube right now my friend. Thank you very much

299
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Five dollars from Throck no question they can throw

300
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Uh, can you please

301
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Ask if they address concerns over store pricing so I just brought this up store pricing expansions or things that won't be brought up today

302
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Do you do the fact that they're it's things that people cannot speak on

303
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So we're only asking things that we can actually get answers on we're not asking any questions that will the devs will basically say well

304
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We can't talk about that right now we're trying to avoid situations where we basically box him in you a corner with five questions in the row

305
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
He's like I can't talk about that. I don't I get fire that can't talk about that like we're trying not to waste time with questions that we know can't be answered already

306
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
so these questions

307
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Are going to be things that we can either get design intent behind or we can get intent

308
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
To develop or things that he could potentially actually talk about where we're trying to not put them in the corner

309
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Plus if you look in the previous interview he we're we're interviewing Adam Jackson today

310
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And one of the things I respected was in the previous interview

311
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:44,000
He stated that he does not talk about or or promise things that he knows he can't follow through on

312
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And so I'm only going to ask him stuff that we can actually get an answer on basically

313
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And if there's some of the things he can't talk about then so be it and he's going to say that he can't talk about it

314
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We are trying a few of these

315
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That we're hoping he can talk about

316
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But they are things that haven't been asked about before and that

317
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You know should promote conversation we're doing our best here

318
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We watched all of the previous interviews and to be honest I respect the the not one need to do false promises

319
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Plus it's one guy up there. He's got a whole team behind him if he goes up and promises like yes

320
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Charms are coming next week then he's he's

321
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Seving the entire team up for a promise that he might potentially not be able to fulfill on and it opens up to them to

322
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Okay, well, you know you said it was coming but now it's not coming blizzard once again is failing on their promises like that

323
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's it's it's it's too hard for somebody who's being interviewed to be able to commit that heavily

324
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
As a singular person who's not like the actual

325
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You know CEO here. So we're he's a class designer. So we're trying to ask questions

326
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That are relative to his job and things he can talk about

327
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Pretty much that simple

328
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
They're the interview happen already. No, it will be happening shortly. It starts in 30 minutes and about 15 will go the audio testing

329
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You

330
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm posting on twitter real quick for the people that follow there so that they know it's about to start

331
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Any questions regarding Paragon boards you will be happy to hear that the first question is about Paragon

332
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Uh, thank you for the 279 Paulo. No question or says message retracted

333
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Can you ask if there are plans to add glyph leveling outside of nightmares?

334
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I do like that question. I'll add that to the rapid fire actually

335
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'll put that one in there. See if we can get to that one. Love the Hawaii tan

336
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
tan in Hawaii as much as I burned for being us

337
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Please ask about boss rotations group to get forex to the the solo player

338
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You know, weren't this already addressed in the previous one. I think people talked about uh the balance around

339
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
The forex and one x

340
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Uberdurio farming. I think this was a question that's already been spoke upon

341
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
If I remember so that one is not in our questions today

342
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Like I say we are trying to stick to questions that have not been addressed

343
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Even if they're pseudo answers

344
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You're completely healed it is actually now. Yeah, I was glad to hear get it glad to hear that I did not have a loss of hearing

345
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I went to the ear doc

346
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Can you ask the dev how to bring back the D2 experience building your character in unique way not again looking and I grabbed where the character and where they complete the pit

347
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Um, so we have a question related to progression of characters outside of the skill tree which because the skill tree portions been answered

348
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So we're pseudo getting to that question

349
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Um, ask them about golem mastery on equipment. You will be happy to hear that is in today's questions

350
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I believe it's actually the second or third one that's specifically about the golem mastery is actually in there

351
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,000
What's their approach the balance between casuals and no lifers like us? I like that question is without one is something because that I actually had previously in the list

352
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Which was about target demographic

353
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Um, and who the games designed for is something I would love to hear more on I ended up cutting that one and the reason I cut it is because it wasn't something

354
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I think everyone cares about which is it's that is more of a business philosophy which is hey

355
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
We're trying to acquire this audience or this audience and I don't think people care about that as much as what the game has in store

356
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So we cut that one in lieu of focusing more on like what do you guys plan to do or development thoughts around things for the game as opposed to

357
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Thoughts around business practices

358
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,000
So we do have that one as a backup question because I personally find the philosophy stuff more interesting and I find like the game balance stuff

359
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Just personally, but we're not going with what I personally find more interesting today

360
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Uh, when is it starting shortly in about 15 minutes we're going to go to audio tests it starts at the top of the hour here

361
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
That's the most important question

362
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I think it's an important question as well, but for the reason stated is why that one is moved to a lower portion of the list just to answer you

363
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Uh, let me look at some crab and reen a while YouTube chat. Let me move over the twitch chat here for a moment. Thanks for the sub buddy

364
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I think I really

365
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Ask if they ever tend to revamp arrogant boards pretty much the first question

366
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Can you ask if I can get an interview too? I got 64 followers only like half of them are bots no problem buddy. I got you

367
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Can we have a DPS meter in target dummies. That's a pretty cool one

368
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Uh, I think that I think I remember that one being asked before but I'm going to add into the rapid fire

369
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
What about clan banks mailboxes etc. I believe expansion upon the clan system was something that was um

370
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Covered previously

371
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I don't think in particular like clan banks or something that's been addressed

372
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
That's not in the questions today

373
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
But we do have uh

374
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The offline question related to clans and here's we have one clan related question for the rapid fire portion

375
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:58,000
What about the new horse actually one of the questions for rapid fire is

376
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
What do you think about doing mounts that like aren't horses?

377
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You know like a maggot from maggot layer

378
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Please ask about strong codes a new mechanic about it strong codes are in the questions today

379
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Can you ask about making side quest rewards on par with other activities?

380
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Uh, that's an interesting one we didn't get to that one though. I don't think that's going to make the list today by like that question

381
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
As some of the rapid fire portions are going to be a more detailed combat log um

382
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
We might be able to get to that one. I don't know our rapid fire portion is filling up pretty quickly here

383
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Does your Tinder profile say skinny hippie Viking?

384
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I'm gonna try hard not to say a your mom joke you know ask your mom. I tried I couldn't do it

385
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Can you talk about how group plays the scourge in the pit? I see this question coming up all the time

386
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I think like the group play versus solo player thing is very very very much

387
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Like talked about already

388
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Um, I think they even addressed this in the previous interview like the one literally from yesterday if I remember right

389
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Can you ask some efficiency rebranding group or solo? Yes, you like this question is getting every 15 seconds

390
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that one was already addressed and they had to kind of

391
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
sue the answer in

392
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Are you gonna be as interrupting as racks was invited to yesterday, but didn't I mean

393
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I'm not gonna and if he's talking about something

394
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I'm not gonna interrupt him to be like hey, can you tell explain to me like you're just as an example

395
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
This is a love of him. Can you explain to me? Why drew companions or the way they are something and he starts talking about it

396
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And be like hey, that was great, but that's your time

397
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Can you explain to me DPS me there's undumbly it's like I'm not gonna do that

398
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
He's on he's on an interview

399
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
and Adam in my opinion from when I saw it doesn't

400
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Rambo a whole lot. He pretty much talks about it

401
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And we have six major questions. We've only honed it down to a smaller amount of major questions

402
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
What about question regarding a season with more in-depth crafting mechanics

403
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Uh, that's very open ended like hey are you guys gonna do a season where you do even more crafting

404
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The answer will be what you think the answer will be you think he's gonna say yes season six actually we have this new mechanic

405
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Let me spoil it for you like what he's gonna say if I ask that type of question is he's just gonna be like maybe

406
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Or we'll see like wait that's all we would get out of that so I actually agree with someone in chat that says ask the right type of questions

407
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
You get the right type of answers. We're trying to put the majority of the work on things we can control

408
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Which is the way that we phrase and ask our questions and the questions we choose to ask so we're not going to ask a whole bunch of stuff that

409
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We can't do anything with we're trying very hard to ask good questions

410
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Because we have a very limited amount of them we think we're gonna get maybe six questions from what we can tell the interview starts shortly

411
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We're gonna be bringing the co-hosting gauzy TV here shortly

412
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yes, TMI is 25 minutes

413
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:35,000
You can ask for more body types for each class the answer that guarantee answer that will be that if I ask about that

414
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Then he's going to say that animations would have to be retooled for every single different body type and that's a ton of work

415
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So it'll be low on the priority list because you know

416
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Maybe I want to play a skinny druid I get that

417
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But then they're going to have to retool animations for all of them and I think they probably have other priorities at the moment

418
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Please

419
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm begging you give ideas to blizzard

420
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I don't think blizzard needs to hear in the 45 minutes like my ideas for their game

421
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I think what we want to hear is their ideas for their own game because that's what you guys care about

422
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I don't think the people there are watching want to hear me develop their game for them in a 45 minute interview

423
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
So more than likely

424
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm not going to be like here's what I think you should do because I can just do that in a video

425
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I can do that in the feedback if I wanted to in the Diablo partner program this core that could just send information

426
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So we're going to be focusing more on

427
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Blizzard's answer in Blizzard's interview

428
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Any future plans for world bosses that is actually one of our questions on the list that made the top priority

429
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Yes, it is something that strong codes in world bosses or something we very much would like to know about the philosophy behind

430
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And that is on our list today

431
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Thoughts on additional cosmetics like weapon glows, etc. We have a couple minor cosmetic questions as well

432
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Okay, so let's poke gauze in here and let's start prepping

433
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:11,000
For the interview here. I'm gonna call my co-host. We're gonna get him in here. We're gonna start stepping up the overlay and what have you

434
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Here we go ring ring banana

435
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:24,000
All right, are we gonna do what the mic sound check in soup instead?

436
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah, we probably need to join the zoom right?

437
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Yes

438
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Okay, there's something there

439
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Okay, let's yeah, let's go ahead and hop in the zoom start getting set up here

440
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm gonna put the questions off to the side so I can see them easily

441
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The interview is about to start boys, so we are now getting ready

442
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I

443
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Naoze we had in game content that scaled and definitely been not really with pit having a similar line thought

444
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We have a mechanic i.e. a glyphic scale like that too

445
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
That's an interesting one

446
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I'll see if I can add that to the rapid fire portion if we end up having time because we do have not infinitely scaling

447
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But the pit is literally harder than aoze now as as pit

448
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I believe it's pit 150 scales to aoc 25 was before so we actually have harder content now than we did before

449
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Okay, so the live stream

450
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Interview is about to start here. I'm gonna join the zoom

451
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
He'll be able to join for audio testing about five minutes. It sounds like so we're getting really close to the interview starting here boys

452
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Okay, I'm gonna join the zoom now cosy

453
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Okay, let's see how this works

454
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Let's drop out discord

455
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Okay, can you hear me guzzi

456
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Okay, adjust your volume yeah, we need to adjust volumes we at the last minute here. We're kind of moving from discord to zoom so

457
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Um, we're trying to get the audio and stuff set up here. Can you just start talking a little bit please?

458
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yes, how do I adjust the volume that I'm hearing from you

459
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
That's what I am currently figuring out here as well. I don't really use zoom

460
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Am I too loud or too low?

461
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Maybe how is how's guys just sound to you guys here?

462
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Mike check Mike check 123 mic check

463
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Too low you're too low so I need to adjust you higher

464
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Okay, maybe participants

465
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Too low. Okay, yeah, definitely low. Um, let's see what I can do about that here

466
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Hmm

467
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I'll find any menus of yeah, that's what I'm looking at too. I know I don't use

468
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Zoom here. I thought we're gonna use discord. So let me

469
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Let me adjust here. Okay, there's so there's settings

470
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Sounds good compared to DM is way too low. Okay. Yeah, let me see what I can do here

471
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay, can you try talking one more time here?

472
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Mike check Mike check 123 123

473
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Okay, you just alter the app sound or I oh I'll be asked it

474
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Okay

475
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Better sounds good good. Okay, so that would do it for

476
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Could be louder a bit better. Okay, we just get everyone balanced. We'll have to take a couple minutes to balance everyone's audio

477
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Before we get rolling here

478
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Need more loud

479
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Can't find a way to adjust your volume. Yeah, I know I'm working on two years

480
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
There's no individual volumes either for there's not

481
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,000
That's I'm just responded. I'd recommend via OBS or Windows level. I'll just fix it on my headset. It's probably fine. Okay

482
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I

483
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Mean I can I guess we have to balance so that our sounds are equal when we're more people though

484
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Yeah, we'll have to balance each individual one here. Yeah, I've zoomed meeting all the way maxed out

485
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,000
On the on the windows and on OBS slider so I can add more gain to I can boost the audio levels too in the OBS if necessary

486
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But we'll have to have my volume on Mike a little bit. Yeah, we'll have to change all of our individual mic levels to to level it out instead doing it in in app then

487
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah

488
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
So that'll be the way we'll have to you I can lower mine a little bit two people saying them a little bit louder

489
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It as long as you can hear him then we'll be all right

490
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And once he gets in here, we'll see what his audio level is like and we should be able to balance it that way

491
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I have like 10 15%

492
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Before I cap out on the interface

493
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Like an increase I think okay, so in both chats both twitch and

494
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
YouTube I'm trusting your guys his feedback

495
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Please give me a w if he sounds fine and we don't need to adjust anything for guisey

496
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Please do an L if it's way too low way too high like there's a problem if it sounds fine

497
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
We don't draw us because the interview is about to start we need a crew feedback here

498
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Like check mic check one two three one two three mic check

499
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Okay, I'm seeing both chats are responding resounding w thank you very much

500
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
couple Ls for people

501
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
mostly w's

502
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Should be louder that shits well now I'm seeing a lot of Ls keep talking keep talking keep talking all right

503
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You want me to adjust the volume here just leave it as this I literally cannot adjust you any higher

504
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It is physically impossible within zoom so you'll need to adjust your microphone

505
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I have maxed it. I hope it's not too loud now. Okay, this is maxed out

506
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Mic check mic check one two three mic check mic check that sounds better on my end

507
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And I guess we'll just have to do the classic Joe Rogan fist from your face with the microphone speak into the mic directly

508
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh, yeah, that's that's the position. I'm in okay perfect. Okay, now I'm seeing everyone saying that's significantly better

509
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That's as good as it's going to get okay, so that sounds fine. So now we'll just once uh Adam arrives here

510
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Then we'll get that going we need to get

511
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Also the I'll have to get the layout setup here for the podcast once he joins then I can I can cut it out

512
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Okay, zoom conference I'm getting

513
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
This setup now

514
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Okay, that's the zoom

515
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
questions

516
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:39,000
We might end up having to bell on the podcast nice little overlay and do it differently because it looks like zoom is one of those ones that does not allow capturing

517
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Really yeah, you can't window capture at least not that I can see

518
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
What server we connected to you

519
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
What server we connected to

520
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
We're soon guessing we're in one of the east coast servers, right? I do not know

521
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
By the way the interview starts and for people wondering it starts in 15 minutes

522
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
We will be starting in 15 minutes, but we're just doing the setup process right now

523
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
That's why we're saying here Messeran was studying success other I'm trying to get all of the setup properly

524
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Okay, let me see if I can use I could probably use display capture duplicates then

525
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
That's a good old fashioned way to do it

526
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
The getaway my friend yeah, the absolute ghetto dogway

527
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Well

528
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Don't know wait too many times

529
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
You gotta love it. Yeah, it's it's one of those okay. We're gonna go with multi window capture here or multi

530
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Display capture to get it up

531
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Believe mercenaries is

532
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
No, our pets first about non-foment pets right in the rapid fire

533
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah, so like both cosmetic pets basically as well as the as well as the father were ones we can do one and two

534
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah, all right, so once you do that

535
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
SR-axi the problem with asking that question is like Dean was talking about earlier for I came in

536
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Is that they can't tell us what they're going to potentially or going to introduce to the game

537
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So they might just the answer will either be they can't talk about it or it sounds like a good idea, but we can't talk about it

538
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
You need anything from me for the setup for your good with everything

539
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Uh, well at the moment I'm stuck waiting on when he joins because once he joins then I can I can get it visually set in the positions

540
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Roger

541
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But we're in the two person layout right now. So until we have the three person layout I can't adjust any near the visuals

542
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I

543
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Little low, uh, we were pretty much where I think we're gonna keep gauzy at the level. He's at this as well as we're able to get him currently

544
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I mean, I can ramp it up on the compressor, but

545
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:29,000
You know that has that has consequences. Yeah, I think you sound about as well as I've ever heard you right now for me

546
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
All right

547
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Okay, uh, I'm gonna so what we're gonna do in order to make the ads not hit during the interview here

548
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Um, I'm going to disable ads on YouTube

549
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Okay, I'm gonna

550
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I'm laughing to it

551
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Yep, uh, I'm just gonna disable ads and on it here put them the lowest I can

552
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Which is conservative

553
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Let me see if I can do it can I go all the way off with them

554
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
There's this new thing that twitch viewers can do pretty cool doesn't cost them anything either

555
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
It's called twitch prime. I know you guys have some just oh there's a pop them

556
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Okay, so I there should be I believe I was able to fully disable

557
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Hope that doesn't affect the like the things and some changing settings right now, but I took monetization

558
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Off entirely on the YouTube ads for YouTube so you guys should just have like no ads at all and

559
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Let me in order to stop ads from occurring during the interview

560
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
We're going to have to let's see if there's one running already now so I can hit the button

561
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
We have to run like the ad now to make it where it gets delayed for a while during the interview

562
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So I have my snoozes which can snooze another 15 minutes plus the 15 minute gap. I'm gonna try to get it

563
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
We'll go the faux hour with no ads

564
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So we'll get that set up too

565
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And then once he joins we'll get his visual setup and then that should be everything we're pretty much good to go with the interview

566
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I miss anything feels like it hasn't started that's because it hasn't it starts in like 10 minutes approximately

567
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Give her take a few minutes. Why we're getting everything set up

568
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Okay

569
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:38,000
For the people on twitch if I'm unable to get the the ads to stop by running them early because right now I have 26 minutes

570
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Of no ads and I can add another 15 so I got 41 minutes in no ads the back like

571
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
10 minutes or something might hit you with a one minute ad

572
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I'm trying to get those delays much possible YouTube will have zero ads right now. I have the completely disabled

573
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Are you nervous?

574
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Really, I mean it's like asking like six questions

575
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I hope you guys like the questions we have at this point

576
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
We're just gonna be reading off the questions we have on the list. We did our best to make sure that they are

577
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Like good good questions, but and stuff that hasn't been asked already. We'll do our best

578
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
But in terms of nervous. I was more nervous for the path of exile ones to be quiet with you

579
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Because I never talked to those dudes probably the PLE ones were nervous maybe the last epoch one because I didn't know last epoch very well

580
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
When we did the interview

581
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Oh, but I mean me coming off as a royal ass probably helped

582
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I don't think I don't think you talk about that more than other people talk about that. I think you're

583
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
You're overhyping. It's really not that big video

584
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I know I was a little bit embarrassed. Those like she didn't even realize it

585
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
But now I talked to them quite a lot, but um

586
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
They liked it. We're gonna have more of the witch reveal comes around. It's gonna be fun

587
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
All right, so let me just see here

588
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Okay, so everything setup as much as I can get it setup currently

589
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
um

590
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,000
There you oh, there's our boy. Okay guys. I'm gonna put a real quick like BRBs screen here

591
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,000
While we are getting things set up because we're gonna do some audio tests and stuff on our end here and get the layout all setup

592
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:27,000
The boys here now. So give us a few moments and we will be right back with the interview

593
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
You

594
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You

595
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
You

596
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
You

597
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
You

598
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You

599
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
You

600
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
You

601
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Okay, ladies and gentlemen we are here with the boy Adam Jackson. Thank you for coming on Adam. How are you doing today?

602
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Hey, I'm doing great. How are you guys doing?

603
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Doing pretty fantastic

604
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Excited

605
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
The the interview questions are going to start because I know we're a little early

606
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
We're about four minutes later. So we're just gonna have a couple minute intro while the people wrote in here

607
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It will be starting at exactly one pmpst

608
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
But outside of that how has the day been for you very easy icebreaker?

609
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Is so we would waste the three minutes before we get going

610
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah, totally

611
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Expand wild we've got so much stuff going on

612
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Between working on season four more seasons and things coming up in the future

613
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Locks-a-planting locks-a-talks the seasons is gonna be coming out soon

614
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I expect a whole lot of feedback and reaction to that. So it's except busy time over here, but pretty exciting as well

615
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Nice man. It sounds like you guys are going to have a pretty interesting launch because season four is coming out here

616
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Very shortly and I think itemization is gonna be the big talk. We do have some questions

617
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,000
related to both itemization what's gonna be next etc for you to go through here on the list before we get started

618
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
We have to do a quick thing and make sure everyone here can hear the audio just fine. Can you hear gauzy? So gauzy? Can you say a sentence?

619
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I can say a sentence absolutely super excited for the release minions. It's all I'm saying

620
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And Adam if literally anything about all you want to say yeah test test

621
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I also am a minion enjoyer it turns out so I've heard talk about them

622
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Oh no don't give don't get guys you start the minions when we get going man

623
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:25,000
We've spent like the last few days to have told you you got to make sure that I don't go off on a rant here because we're gonna spend the next 45 minutes on that topic

624
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:33,000
So we've done our best to make sure we don't get stuck there. Okay, I'm trying to I'm trying to keep him on a leash from from the whole thing being

625
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Necromancer interview, but we'll do what we have to do so I get it everyone has their thing some people

626
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Extrude wolves some people it's necromanians some people it's breaking the game with bar permanently. Everybody's got their thing

627
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:52,000
All right, so with that being said, I think we've stalled enough to let the people roll in if you're not here by now

628
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
We're just gonna get going. We kind of had just we're wasting the minute or two because it's we're a couple minutes early

629
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:04,000
But with that being said, thank you everyone for joining across a different livestream platforms for this interview with blizzard's own Adam Jackson

630
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Before we get going you wanted to say who you are

631
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
What your job is over there for the people that for some reason don't happen in now

632
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Yeah, totally so hi everybody my name is Adam Jackson. I'm the lead class designer specifically on the live classes team

633
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So our group handles a lot of the update all pretty much all of the balance updates that you see going into the game for classes

634
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
We also are heavily involved in systems and and the stuff that you see really in

635
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
seasonal and expansion releases that have to do with the things that you farm and why and the classes themselves

636
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And the new legendaries unique going in that kind of stuff

637
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And gaussie introduce yourself for the people that don't know

638
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Um minion Andy. I guess it's the easiest way to describe it

639
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:52,000
um, I do most of everything guys called this very RPG games. You know most of you for you know path effects all the other four plus evil gracefully

640
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
uh

641
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Just a hard

642
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
minion enjoyer. I can't get get enough of it

643
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
minion Andy gaussie and of course i'm DM and that being said we're gonna get going

644
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So thank you first of all for joining us for the interviewer. There's now one pmp st

645
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
We're gonna start with our first question. So right out of the get go

646
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
We have some questions. Hopefully we can get to all of them if we don't it's all good

647
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:22,000
We're gonna start with the first one here, which is with the recent focus of gameplay being post 100 the one to 50 process a little faster than it used to be on launch right

648
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Where the teams thoughts on progressing the paragon system and example being like new paragon boards etc

649
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Yeah um

650
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
So i think

651
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
There's definitely room i believe and this is like my personal opinion talking here

652
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:44,000
But i think that there's definitely room to make paragon more interesting um adding new boards and things as always on the table

653
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
That is something that we can do um and probably is something that we will do

654
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,000
But i the way that we kind of think of paragon is that it's kind of your one stop shop where we try to make stats cool

655
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Right like why you care about strength why you care about whatever stats you're chasing like it's one of those places where we try to make it a little bit more interesting to robust

656
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Uh, i think we did a decent job at the launch game with paragon

657
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
But i think that there's more that we could add to the depth of the system to make it uh

658
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Just more appealing you know, we did a little bit of that in season two if you remember we started adding um

659
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Scaling mechanics where we turn some of your stats that are always additive into multiplicative scaling stats

660
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Um like usually in legendary paragon nodes and other places, but that's kind of a little bit of experimentation in that regard

661
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
i would uh

662
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Expect that we do more in the future of course nothing to announce

663
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
But that's kind of how we're thinking about it right now is that it it's cool

664
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
We think there's more opportunity to do cool things there um something simple like adding new boards

665
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Yeah, i don't i don't think there's really a high risk there and it's something that i can totally see us doing

666
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
i'm curious to the idea of the further

667
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Development of the paragon system because i know in the interview you had with raks

668
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Uh the question regarding the skill tree was that the idea was to not further develop that to at least not too much

669
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
For the sake of new and newer players and then after a lot of 50

670
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
We see a progression of that part being the game focus for the company

671
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:10,000
But how do you see that well how does the team think about the progression of that development without making it too advanced for those players?

672
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Yeah, good question uh

673
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Paragon worth this in a different place than the skill tree right skill tree is like the very first thing you're introduced to

674
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
A player so keeping that experience um

675
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Really easy to understand and robust for someone that's never played in a rpg before is a much harder task compared to paragon where

676
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Paragon you've already gotten pretty far into the game or beat the campaign is our expectation

677
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So we're uh we're allowed to add more complexity at that point in the game

678
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Um that being said there are some like UX issues like we we know about with paragon like you know it can be a pain to reset and fill in all the

679
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Many little blitz that you have to like i think those are actually more uh

680
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
concerning issues that i would rather see us tackle than only adding new content

681
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I think we can do both of course

682
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
But these are kinds of the things of the problems that we're looking to solve i guess you could say with paragon

683
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
simplicity is always a

684
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
A factor because we do want people to understand our game and arpgs are notoriously a crunchy um

685
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
But if there is a place that we can be a little crunchier. I would say it is in paragon

686
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Uh if anywhere in our game if that makes sense

687
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
That's fair um we can move on to the next question

688
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And we have is that as many people are planning their bills in season four and we would like to ask for some clarity pre-launch regarding

689
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
tempering affixes mostly due to the fact that the patch notes state that they'd be balanced

690
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:36,000
But lack specific details and i guess the same question applies to core modifier such as ranks the goal of mastery

691
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Being available on multiple item slots

692
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yeah lots of people like to ask about goal of mastery

693
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
So i guess what i would say is when it comes to

694
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
patch notes and what we showed a players between ptr and life is that

695
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
We kind of have rules and and guidelines for how we present patch notes and what we put in them um for

696
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Between releases and ptr is kind of a special case because

697
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
ptr we're introducing new content to you for the first time

698
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:10,000
But then the live patch is actually when we introduce that content for real and i'm using air quotes right because not everybody is expected to play the ptr

699
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
ptr is also notoriously not balanced because it's way earlier in development than when we would normally release something

700
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And so you know managing expectations and how we present patch notes is is something that we're still figuring out

701
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And what that really means is you know when we introduce whole new systems to the game

702
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
We don't specify every single little detail of them as an example in the ptr

703
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
You know when we introduce the recipes we don't list every single tempering recipe and what the numbers are right now

704
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
In the ptr notes because that like our notes are already huge. It would blow them out

705
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Um and make them way bigger right and

706
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Then if we you know

707
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Don't put them in ptr, but then we put them in live then we blow out those notes and then it's like

708
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Well, why didn't you put them in ptr and then if we only show the difference like only show the things that we change

709
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Then people are wondering well

710
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Why did you only show like half the tempering recipes because other of all those are the ones that you change

711
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
But you're not showing the rest and then it can get confusing of like well, where are the rest of the recipes

712
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Right, like why don't you show it all and so like it's an easy kind of

713
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Thing to get caught up and in what we show so in the future. I think we can show more

714
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
It just means that we would have to like commit to showing that in the ptr

715
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Which that means there's more pressure on the ptr release to have those things in a better state and and actually quantify out the bigger list of changes, right?

716
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Um, so it depends but as far as like specifics if you want to know some of the things like that are changing with tempering

717
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
There's a whole a whole lot of number changes

718
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Most of them are minor and aren't really that big of a deal

719
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We did shift around where a few of the recipes or not right

720
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Yeah, like what stats are and what recipes and that kind of stuff did make more sense based on feedback

721
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Um, and then we did adjust some things that were just

722
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
The typical this is early in development and wasn't intended at all, but it's ptr

723
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
So you know, this is when you get to see it

724
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Uh, the ranks of golm masteries and that category. I think people were getting crazy like 25 plus or something ranks

725
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:08,000
No, it's supposed to be just like every single other passive that you get it's only in you know very few slots and it's very special when you get it

726
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
So, you know, if you were planning on making a golm build where they slam for two billion damage

727
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Uh, you're not going to do it via mastery ranks

728
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Um, but there I'm sure there's other ways to still make things crazy

729
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
All right, guys, you got this minion you got this minion question and got an answer there nice and early got it out of the way

730
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Uh, so

731
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I mean since we're talking about the ptr I just want to slip of an additional follow up to that

732
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Did you guys get out of the ptr what you were hoping to get?

733
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I know the players were excited to actually get their hands on the ptr and test that etc

734
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:42,000
But I'm curious if you guys got what you were hoping to get out of launch unique. Oh absolute absolutely uh in spades uh

735
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:50,000
When we released very large swaths of the game like I would say the launch was the closest to the season two is moderately close to this

736
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,000
But I think this is bigger than that because we have to do all vitaminization right um we gave people stats and powers that they never had access to

737
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Not limited to uniques where we can very control like hey you get this very specific special powerful thing

738
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,000
But in items like you know tempering affixes and things where we let you get bonus projectiles across the board or area size

739
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Those are very high risk things um from our point of view and by risk

740
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I mean like not only are they scary because of balance but they're scary because of like pc performance and breaking servers and stuff

741
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Um because a lot of our game wasn't made in mind with every projectile could not just have one more but be doubled in the amount

742
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Or you know these the size of these skills were handcrafted to be this is the size and you know

743
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
We may have a back alley deal like yep

744
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
We're never gonna do that again have a handshake

745
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
We're never gonna increase it whatever because this is what the size is gonna be and then we're like oh wait

746
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
We want to double it and do more than actually we did more than double in ptr. We didn't even have a cap

747
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Um and so we have to figure out like

748
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
How we're gonna manage these things for the long term be healthy in the game

749
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
PTR was incredibly helpful for that uh we got a ton of balance feedback which is is nice um

750
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
But let's see the bigger important one was like how does the game feel like the playing through the whole

751
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Experience of tempering master working in that progression

752
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Yeah, we can have an idea of it, but you know when you have

753
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
You know 50 100 200 even a thousand people playing it uh it's not nearly as much

754
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Information as you would think compared to like 10 million people playing it right or whatever like when you when you throw numbers

755
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
At something you really see the cracks very quickly and very easily and they're more clear

756
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Whereas when we're only testing things internally

757
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
We'll be like oh this could be a problem or oh this doesn't feel great

758
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
But it might be fine right like we can have a discussion and we're using our brains and figuring it out

759
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
But we don't have the surety that we do when we throw a ton of people at it

760
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Especially people who are experts on ARPGs like you you guys and you know the our other creators and and even just hard work

761
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Community members that really like to crunch these numbers and figure things out

762
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
They'll find things in five minutes that might take us five days

763
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Right so it's just efficient. Okay, so yeah

764
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,000
All right, so yes incredibly useful but appreciate the insight on that one so moving on to the next question here

765
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:03,000
So one of the major things that are happening season four is obviously itemization that rework is now being complete with loot reborn

766
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
What would you guys like to focus on next is your next sort of major focus?

767
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Yeah

768
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Really good question

769
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I can't get super specific details but I can give you ideas of how we're thinking about things right now sure

770
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Immediate future. I think actually the focus of the team is on reacting to season four and this big up people that we made to the game

771
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I am very sure that there will be cracks in tempering and master working and the player journey as far as you know

772
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:38,000
The pit and how all of this feels when put together of like how good the game actually is and those cracks are need to be

773
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Gonna need to be iterated on and filled a little bit of like hey, you know

774
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:46,000
We need more temporary recipes here or hey the progression of the pit doesn't feel that great there or whatever right

775
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Our immediate thing is because we help people so much in our game

776
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,000
You know your whole endgame way that you interact with the obel of four and your item progression is now a journey rather than just you

777
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Hope the perfect items drops and you're done

778
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Um those are huge foundational things in a RPG

779
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So making those and refining those to be good is the immediate largest concern by a pretty good amount

780
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Like when yeah, I think when you look at like what we're thinking of with updates with season five

781
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Right now I'm being a little bit cagey of like I need to leave some reaction time for my team and myself to like really look at season four of

782
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:25,000
What are the things that we need to react to quickly that would be the most benefit you know the biggest biggest pain for your bucket season five for example

783
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Um, but think it a little bit more long term like things that aren't immediate reactions to season four

784
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I would say you know

785
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
We're definitely taking a stab at it in season four

786
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But I think that there's still going to be room to try and make the end game uh better for longer

787
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Like have that tail feel good for a longer period of time and have a little bit more refinement in that section of the game

788
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,000
So to speak so we're thinking and talking a lot about that because it's been a thing that we've been you know

789
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Asked about by the community basically since we launched is like better end game better end game better end game

790
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And so that's that's something that's on our mind

791
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
um

792
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Also on the class side personally one of the things that's on my mind a lot is trying to catch up other classes to barbarian because barbarians have more weapons

793
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Um, this has been a big thorn in our side for a very long time of that they kind of have two class mechanics and everybody else has one

794
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Um, and so our our current plan is to kind of juice up those other classes so that they're really crazy impactful and good and feel awesome

795
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
So that they kind of make up for the lack of aspects that barbarians get

796
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Um, and itemization makes barbarians stronger like there's a bunch of things that having more items

797
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Makes difficult to balance I would say and so really having a firm solid answer to that we got we kind of addressed it a little bit in season four with the necromancer

798
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Is our first whack at this where we just juice the book of the dead and made a crazy powerful good and tried to do in a way

799
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That wasn't just numbers that you know like make it cool right is something I told by people a lot to focus on

800
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
um

801
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And so we're gonna see how that goes, but well i want to do that for the other classes right um

802
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
So that's kind of one of the big things at the top of our mind on the class side

803
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
So with in game oh sorry go guys

804
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I was just curious like we talked about end game that's the focus end game end game end game

805
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I'm curious about the definition like what are we talking about when we say end game

806
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Because that's different from it's very subjective right are we talking about level 50 to 100 or are we talking about post 100

807
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Yep

808
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
So funny you ask i think joe

809
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Do you mentioned it in an earlier interview we used to think of end game as everything after the campaign

810
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Was our original definition we launched the game and we had to change our definition because that wasn't what players were

811
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Thinking insane and the way that just people talked about our game

812
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
They thought end game was post 100 or maybe world tier 4 right and and

813
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Right now i would say it's still not exactly

814
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Perfect of what we think of when we say end game i think people still have various opinions my definition of end game is probably something close to

815
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
World tier 4 and when that starts or

816
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:52,000
When you get to level 100 is an obvious benchmark that people can have but in my mind it's when you have access to all of the

817
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Activities that you can do in the game

818
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Which to me would now probably be whenever you go into the pit

819
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Because i don't there's no activity after that that is like a new activity that you could not access at all

820
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
So that's what i think of when i think of end game

821
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
But i think if you ask 10 different people you may get like three or four different answers

822
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Um, but that's kind of how we think about it and talk about it mostly on the team either of that or level 100

823
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You know if you want to think about it that way

824
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:21,000
So how do you deal with the difficulty of creating end game when players are able to consume the content quicker than almost any

825
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Developers going to be able to produce the end game while also shrinking the beginning portion of the game

826
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You level 200 faster than you ever have you're able to get into these end game activities

827
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Faster than ever, but you're also either deficit in terms of in game content

828
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
So you're developing it while people are consuming a fast and you can how do you resolve these issues?

829
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Oh god

830
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
This is a very long answer and i could go into it for a long time. So i'll try to keep it brief

831
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It's a very difficult problem

832
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
And it is one that i think every our air PG has and it's one that we all have to kind of live with

833
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Admitting but there isn't a perfect forever solution

834
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Because really what you're saying is and this is like the the two things that are competing right is

835
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
uh

836
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Players

837
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Want content and our game is a power fantasy. That's what the RPGs are right they we sell you on you do things to become more powerful to

838
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Have a new mountain to climb to be more powerful to have a new mountain to climb problem is there only so many mountains that we could make as a development team

839
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Right because the the the mountains are usually content

840
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And so the the difficulty that i think every air PG runs into is

841
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
You can only create so many mountains. So the first thing we try to do is create as many mountains as we can

842
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Right have as many various end game activities and and things for you to do that are interesting and awesome and then

843
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
You know

844
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Do that for as long as we can but like you said

845
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,000
People are crazy and they consume content really really quick some of them do some of them not so much

846
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
We have to balance between those two player types which is a whole other conversation

847
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
um

848
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
But then on the other side uh

849
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You know for the people that can consume that content quickly

850
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:01,000
We want to make sure that there's things for them to do that are interesting and meaningful right and so this is why you see a very common way

851
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:07,000
The air PGs are designed is that we use a random generated dungeons and random generated content for the end game

852
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And why we do things like scale things either

853
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Pretty hard or infinitely so that you have a challenge against your player power right like player power goes up

854
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
You need something to fight against it as you're getting better if you don't have something to fight against it

855
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Then really your answers are like make another character and do the journey again or you get bored leave come back later

856
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Right

857
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Um, and those are kind of the options that a player has or you know go against infinitely scaling content um

858
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:41,000
That's kind of like the box that we're in when we're designing and a lot of our work as designers is how do we make

859
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Fun content and resolve these issues as best we can

860
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
um

861
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
A perfect solution is where it requires like a paradigm shift

862
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
I think of like you have to kind of change what an air PG is and like

863
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Make your game air PG but also a little bit of something else that you don't have to worry about this problem

864
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
But in an air PG space, I think this is kind of just

865
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
What it is and how people progress through it is a challenge that we're forever gonna have and so you're gonna see us

866
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,000
You know kind of bounce back and forth of like infinitely scaling content but also matching that with milestone content or

867
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
aspirational content is another word that people like to use that I like of you know like uber little if or these things

868
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Or it's like I get this thing

869
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I see this thing. It's a fixed difficulty

870
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,000
I want to get good enough to beat that and then I feel good and I can either stop or try and go to the next thing until there's things that run out

871
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And then I'm I'm happy and I leave happy

872
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Right our goal at the higher higher level is that you leave happy right and whether that means you're doing aspirational

873
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Or you do forever content for a while and then you kind of turn out

874
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
We want to make sure both of those experiences feel good

875
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Sure

876
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
That's fair listening to that answer. I mean do you feel like or would it be fair to say that the teams

877
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Focus on effort right now has gone from the early stage of focusing on new player acquisition to more of an

878
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:01,000
returning player focus and end game replay ability and longevity of the player base is that what we're the focus is without

879
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:08,000
We're focused on both I think my team right now is focused on the latter part

880
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
But remember Diablo 4 is a large team with many different sub teams. I'm on the live team

881
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So my focus right now is kind of end game because that's just what we see as as a place we could do better

882
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,000
But there are people on the team absolutely focus on new player experience new player

883
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
How they interact with the game returning players that have you know

884
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
They played the the original campaign and then left and they're coming back

885
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That's a discussion that we're having as well. How do we make that experience the best that we can so

886
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
There's actually a lot of different classes of players and the types of people that play Diablo 4 because it's such a large game

887
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:45,000
You know, we're trying to appeal to many different types of people that play RPGs and even those that this is their introductory game

888
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
So our task is a little different than

889
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Then some other games where you know they have a more specific focus. We try to grab it all. We're greedy

890
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
But you know, we want to make sure that games good for both parties and that does means there's some sacrifices sometimes

891
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
We really are like trying to make it good for all of them

892
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
That's hard problem, but we that is actually what we're trying to do

893
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Like high level vision. Let's just move on to the next question. It says we don't we're kind of limited in time

894
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yeah, let's talk about overworld contents and that is literally the identity defining for Diablo 4 right and

895
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
The question we have is what are the teams thoughts on the potentials of strongholds and bosses having a bigger role to play moving forward?

896
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Oh strongholds and bosses

897
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I guess I'll ask you a question back. I can give you a very easy answer and that answer will be we think they're cool

898
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And we could work on them or I can give you like something I think is a lot more interesting. Okay, then maybe an in-depth discussion

899
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I'll leave it up to you guys, but let's go for the latter. Yeah. All right, because I find this fast very interesting. Why strongholds?

900
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Why we designed them and what we think about them in board bosses. So

901
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Um, I think there's a concept that's very interesting

902
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:04,000
I would advise you and anyone that any of your followers would really want to get into game design or want to talk better about game design

903
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
There was a really great

904
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
GDC presentation made by a guy named Alex Jaffy

905
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
He's from Riot actually and he gave one of the best presentations I've ever seen on game design

906
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And he gave the presentation on something called cursed problems in game design

907
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
And I promise this will lead back to strongholds very directly

908
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Um, but what a cursed problem is in game design is this idea that

909
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:34,000
When you make a game of a certain archetype you immediately make a bunch of promises to the player and these promises

910
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Come with problems that we call cursed problems

911
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:43,000
There are these things are so fundamental to the foundation of your game that you can't get away from them

912
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
And they're kind of your partner forever and or wait on your back that you have to deal with that you never get rid of

913
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
But you can mitigate

914
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I'll give an example of a cursed problem in another genre and game. I used to work on heroes of the storm

915
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Exo moba right like legal legends here are played legal legends. You'll hear this complaint a lot of

916
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:08,000
uh matchmaking and playing a fight a team-based game by having individual progression right the promise that you make when you play a moba or a team-based game is that you are playing with other people

917
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,000
But one of the big things that they sell you want when you play the game is that you have a ranking system that's based on your personal improvement

918
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:20,000
So you're being ranked individually, but you go into a team game with nine other people and those other people when can interact

919
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
You can have a game where you couldn't have one no matter how good you are because those gate people impact your performance

920
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
And so you commonly get the complaint of hey, I went into a team-based game

921
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I did well, but my teammates suck and I'm mad because I lost ranked points, right? I play very common

922
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:42,000
This is a part this is a cursed problem of matchmaking based team-based games where your motivation that we promise you is individual performance

923
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
How about Diablo? Let's tie it back to Diablo a cursed problem

924
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I would argue in ARPGs like Diablo and any other game you'll probably have seen this problem is that they are games of efficiency

925
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
We promise you

926
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Player power is a big reason why you play these games is you want to go in you start off as this pion person that kind of sucks

927
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And is it very strong and you grow into this really crazy master of magic or

928
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Strength or whatever that can do incredible things, right?

929
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
And the way that we deliver you on that promise is we give you

930
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Power as you play the game more and progress through the activities usually in the form of gear

931
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
But also in other ways too right skill points paragon whatever it is

932
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
um

933
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:31,000
What that translates to is that anything that you are doing in the game that isn't progressing your power is very hard to

934
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Sell a player on sure to make them want to do it and it's even harder to sell them if it's a

935
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
If it's not a repeatable activity that they can keep doing to get stronger and stronger

936
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
The way that I describe cursed problems or think about it is like when you ask me

937
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Hey Adam, what do you think of strongholds or world bosses or uberlilith balance or a whole lot of other problems

938
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
I would think of these cursed problems like a tree

939
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And the cursed problem is actually the trunk the center of the game what the game actually is and why you come to play it

940
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And you're asking me about a leaf at the very edge of the branch

941
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And so I can give an answer like yeah the leaf yaks cool we could work on it

942
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
But like really the leaf connecting to the

943
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
The you know branch connecting to the trunk

944
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
This is what's actually causing the thing that you're asking the question about right?

945
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
So when it comes to strongholds

946
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Why are strongholds? Why do you ask me the question like hey? What about strongholds? Can we make them better?

947
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
The reason why it's a question that people ask I think is because people

948
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Strongholds are intended and why they are cool and why they go against the rest of our game and why it's really hard for us is that

949
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:42,000
They are meant to be one shot awesome kind of story-based really handcrafted curated content right

950
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I would equate this to uberlilith statues where we got this question the other day

951
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
The campaign experience we get equate these are all actually the same question

952
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Which is hey?

953
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:55,000
You people on d4 made this one shot experience that we really love and is cool

954
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
We want to do it more

955
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:03,000
The problem is the moment you cross that line from one shot in an it being cool to being a repeatable activity

956
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Now that activity is competing with everything else in the game that is repeatable content

957
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Because now strongholds has to compete against hell tide nightmare dungeons the pit

958
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Gathering unique all of it or has to fit in there in some way

959
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:24,000
So one question about that then so what makes strongholds different like why can't we do an uber version of a strong

960
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Code since people say they want to replay it but we can do an uber version of bosses that are already in the game

961
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
So we can do the love absolutely. Yeah, I understand your claim. We absolutely can't

962
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Is the answer but then you've changed it

963
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
The fundamental relationship that you have as a player with strongholds is different now

964
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
You've changed it from one shot. This is a cool experience

965
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:49,000
That's very unique and that is what the fantasy is a people that like it now you've changed that to repeatable content that you're gonna do

966
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
10 20 a hundred times over and the thing is a lot of content and this is where it's kind of a curse problem

967
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Air PG we think of every content type that we add this way is it repeatable is it not and the way that you design that content is

968
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Very different because if it's repeatable that means that you have to design the content in such a way that it is fun

969
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:14,000
A hundred or a thousand times that puts a lot more design constraint and limitations of what you can make that content

970
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
As an example or many examples when you launch the game

971
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Um, you can you can even think of some when you when you think of your experience with the game when you do something

972
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
500 times you care about things that you wouldn't care about if you did it one time

973
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
This is why for example

974
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I get questions a lot of why can't can you let us reset boss rooms

975
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Why do you want to reset boss rooms? It's because you do it 500 times and it sucks to do that every single time

976
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
If you had to do it one or two times ever you wouldn't care very much

977
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Why did you have to ride your horse tonight meridungeons when we launch the game? It's fair

978
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:49,000
It was fun the first time world building immersion really cool doing it 500 times because that's all that you're doing at your end game

979
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Not so fun, right? And so it would you be concerned about the same issue with the new 200 bosses if let's say we took some of the rewards

980
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Okay, and added like

981
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Uber this just for the sake of the debate here

982
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
So let's say we want to do a strong codes and you say well, you know, DM you liked it the first time

983
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
You might not like it the 100th time and I say fair enough

984
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
But then I come back with you and say okay

985
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Well, what if we took some of the rewards that I would either get from the pit like a grab bag

986
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
We take some of the the pit rewards we take some of the uber level 200 rewards

987
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And we throw almost like a world boss loop pinata as an option

988
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
To be one of these mountains that you mentioned earlier

989
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Maybe we don't want to make it the best thing

990
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Maybe we want to make it a breakup of the experience so that we can get basically the same resources

991
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
We got to get it literally anyway from something else

992
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
But it gives us variety in terms of gameplay

993
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Now I'm not arguing. This is the best way to go with the game

994
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I'm just curious about the thought I was behind that. I think that's a good question

995
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
The answer is yes, we can

996
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't usually it doesn't

997
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
The reason why in our in my experience designing a RPGs for a while now is

998
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It's really hard to tell somebody hey you have option a and option b

999
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Option a is a hundred percent efficient option b is 70 percent efficient. What does a hundred percent of players do

1000
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Max will make skies. What is the best nightmare dungeon you want to do everybody makes guys?

1001
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
What is the quickest way to do the thing? What is the most efficient people are gonna do the thing

1002
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
And it's not like if something is a you know a hundred percent of vision versus 50 percent that 50 percent of players

1003
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Do the 50 percent and the other half do the hundred that's now how it works out in player behavior

1004
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
It's 99 percent of people do the hundred percent of it's a fair counter

1005
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:31,000
That's a fair. I'm not sure I agree entirely like I'm a player that I guess I would qualify as a blaster

1006
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Not a casual player

1007
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:41,000
But I feel like the what makes an ARPG great is to make people distracted from the fact that they are played in ARPG

1008
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Is in reality in the RPG game is

1009
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Honestly, the very definition of insanity. We are doing the same thing over and over over again with the only goal of

1010
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Proving our character to continue doing the same thing over and over again to do the same thing

1011
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:01,000
And the best they are produced the game that you can play would be a game where you are distracted from the fact that you were doing the same thing over and over again

1012
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
So having options where they're not there slightly less rewarding is another part

1013
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
That's another topic

1014
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:12,000
But the fact that you have options to engage with for the sake of in game replayability longevity would allow you to be

1015
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Distracted from that fact and actually enjoy your time. That's the way I see it. I'm not sure I entirely agree with that

1016
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I completely agree with you. I want to premise this. I'm presenting to you the problem

1017
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I'm not saying that a curse problem has no solutions and no ways to make it better

1018
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
The bulk of my time is spent trying to

1019
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Answer the questions that you guys just asked and do it in a way that

1020
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Does make it better even though I know it's a problem that will never be completely absolutely solved, right?

1021
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
We do do things like this some ways for example that we get you to do a variety of activities because we do want you to

1022
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Is like a common strategy is we gate certain rewards behind certain activities

1023
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Which makes you you need to go and do multiple things right like you have glyph xp and nightmare dungeons you have the hell tide

1024
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
The cinders and helltie that you couldn't really get very easily

1025
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And I'm like we have things that are special to them to make you go around

1026
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
I think a better solution. We've kind of moved a little bit more in this is you you can get things

1027
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
You get some activities or materials or whatever from many places

1028
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
There is one place that is the most efficient

1029
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
But you're getting pseudo efficiency somewhere else and that feels really good example of this would be doing

1030
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Heltides with whispers right if you're doing helltides and you want varshawn materials for whispers double dipping on that feels really good as a player

1031
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,000
And we want to do that and do that more and that I think it's kind of an answer for your uber strongholds question

1032
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Is I'm not saying by the way my answer is not we can't do uber strongholds because of these problems

1033
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
What I'm saying is I'm trying to teach you

1034
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Why it's not so easy as just like hey make uber strongholds replaceable and now everybody's gonna love them immediately

1035
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Right, we were changing a content type from a one shot

1036
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:50,000
This is kind of similar to the campaign idea right but changing the campaign experience from a one shot to a feels good a hundred times

1037
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
we have to think about

1038
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
That we think about that content differently now totally and that requires a little more thought and care

1039
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Not just some rewards, but how it feels to go through it over and over again, right because it's fixed

1040
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
That's very nice. I have some randomness to make it feel better as you're going through it over and over

1041
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
It's just there's more problems that we have to solve right? Okay, it's a consumer

1042
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
It's a design consumable

1043
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
You make it into something repetitive it changes the fundamentals of how you originally created it

1044
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I can understand and take I appreciate that I'll move the conversation on here so we can get into some of the other questions

1045
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
We still have here

1046
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:25,000
So currently build variety in the game is mostly designed around item modifier

1047
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
So like unique items live this wall it's been one example

1048
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
It just fundamentally changes the way skill works here

1049
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I'm has there been discussion from the team around modifying skills potentially outside of unique items like within

1050
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Paragon boards other inventory based items whatever you want to call it

1051
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Yeah

1052
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Fun fact when we were originally designing things of the game a lot of the changing of the skills is actually in the skill tree

1053
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And then we called them AB choices, but you know the the different upgrades you could get for your skill

1054
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Um the original thought behind it was like you know you can make your you know frozen orb like option A is like

1055
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Way different than option B where there are almost like different use cases for the skill right and we moved a little bit away from that

1056
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Some of them are still a little transformative

1057
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I think that we can make them a little bit more so in the skill tree as we do in the future

1058
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
That's one way that I think we can make the skill tree interesting without introducing a bunch of complexity

1059
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
My favorite example I give to people on my team is a kick you know kick isn't that popular of a skill

1060
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
But the difference between baseline kick and power kick

1061
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:29,000
The upgrade where it changes into a basically a core skill where it uses all your resource and does a buttload of damage to a person

1062
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
You know you went from thinking of you know

1063
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
This skill is like you think of the geometry of the game and kicking enemies into walls and it was too complex

1064
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I think a little bit for probably laundry with this with the speed of our game

1065
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
But the idea was there of like one way is you're playing 40 chesting or rewarded

1066
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
And the other way is you chase a resource and you just you know

1067
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
This is spartus somebody and kill them with a for a billion damage right

1068
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Completely different fantasies and ways that you interact with the skill

1069
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I think we could probably do a little bit more there with other skills to kind of make them transformative like that

1070
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
um

1071
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:06,000
We ended up doing more legendaries and uniques as the space that we do that because we knew that items were so important and being excited for a

1072
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
A lake a item to drop was

1073
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Was a very core part of the game

1074
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
We've kind of now made that a lot better with like greater affixes for example and things in season four

1075
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
So I think there is more room to make transformative

1076
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
upgrades in other places than items

1077
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
uh

1078
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,000
But we I also am very comfortable with the system that we have now and I kind of like it gives you obvious things to chase

1079
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
With items and it feels good to get an item that is a big upgrade that changes how you play

1080
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:40,000
So I guess we're I'd be open to feedback from people like is there a place that you think is superior to items to get these kinds of effects

1081
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Like is it cooler to have it be deterministic in the paradigm board versus your farming for something and you see the moment that it drops the transforms your gameplay

1082
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I mean I'd be in the boat of saying uh, you know

1083
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Make the skill tweak going to grow into a tree that that's kind of the boat that I'm sitting in but and I also understand when the interview had with racks

1084
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
How that is um

1085
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
There's reasons for that to keep in that simplistic

1086
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:10,000
So it makes sense to have it in the endgame version of something dropping or you know jem or whatever you want to go for a power or unique item

1087
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Yeah, but how unless you have any full-lock question that day and I wanted to ask you about the um

1088
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:23,000
The how that fits into the philosophy of a gay lead class designer when it comes to the fantasies that these altering skills or unique

1089
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Whatever you want to go for would have an impact on the class design

1090
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I'm sorry, not quite sure. I'm gonna try to reword that that was horrible

1091
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I was wondering how the these unique items are skill altering

1092
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:45,000
It modifiers no matter where you get them how that would impact the class design when it comes to focusing on keeping or

1093
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
maintaining the specific fantasies of classes

1094
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Yeah um

1095
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
So when I think of a build or a team thinks of a build we try and think of the entire package

1096
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
And we compare to the whole other package of a class. I don't think of a build like I don't know

1097
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Frozen orb

1098
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Let's say right when I think of like the total power and coolness and strength and all that if there's a journey

1099
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,000
The entity to be made but I think of it as you end with all the things right you end with the conjurations

1100
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Cassie frozen orbs and you're blowing up everything on your screen. It's awesome, right?

1101
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
So when we think about like designing a new class or when we're first designing these classes

1102
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
We have to think of you know

1103
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:30,000
How do we make it interesting and good player journey from the beginning when you first use a skill making that as impactful and cool as possible

1104
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:37,000
While at the same time balancing against you need to leave room for growth and making things crazy and also to make it better

1105
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Some skills are easier to do than others with that I would say

1106
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:47,000
We definitely had a lot of things before the game came out discussions about like hey this skill doesn't it feels really crappy early on

1107
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And we're like yeah it gets really crazy later on though

1108
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
They're like yeah, but who's gonna pick it up if it feels really shitty early on right like

1109
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
You have to balance the two things and that one is like

1110
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:00,000
It's just a bunch of discussions and iteration even when the game is live of people complaining about it right and we're like

1111
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Yeah, we agree and then we change it

1112
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Example that would be like barbs and jurids for a while have been complaining that early game kind of sucks

1113
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
But then late game the powerhouses and that's kind of in the identity

1114
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
And so we've been like alleviating over and over again. Like basis skills are a little better. They're a little better

1115
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
We will why go too far, but we keep making them better right

1116
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Um, so that's kind of how we think of it

1117
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
We think of the whole package and we try to make sure that your journey is enjoyable and good

1118
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,000
And that's true by the way with items and tempering and stuff right we tried to create that journey and our amazation

1119
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,000
That was the point of season four because we think that's what makes a good ARPG experience

1120
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Absolutely

1121
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
So we have we're approaching about 10 minutes or so left here right around there

1122
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
So we do have some rapid fire section which I mean

1123
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Then not all of these are just yes and no type thing so you feel free to talk about these don't have to just be like one more the answers

1124
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:52,000
But we have about 15 20 these I'm gonna try the blast through that are these are mostly primary

1125
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Questions grab from YouTube comments grab from the the chats etc the community just continues to ask over and over again

1126
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Some of these and may have already been asked apologize if they have but just because they've been spam quite a bit

1127
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:08,000
One of the ones that we're seeing quite often is people are asking about rates

1128
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:16,000
So we have overworld bosses right pretty cool people items like a big loop pin you out every now and then is there any plans of further developments or maybe guys thought about

1129
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Potentially of raids like eight man ten man related to clans larger size

1130
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
basically yeah

1131
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
First I would say this is just Adam's personal opinion not the team

1132
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Because I know everybody has different thoughts on it, but I think raids are interesting and cool

1133
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I think that they would present quite a few

1134
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Hurtles for us to overcome that make things tough

1135
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I think they're probably doable

1136
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:47,000
But as an example of some of the the things I think of right away that are like oh my god. This is scary is like

1137
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Even now we have a problem where we're always

1138
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
competing against solo players efficiency versus group play efficiency

1139
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
There's a lot of people that play Diablo and RPGs that really have a strong identity with wanting to play by themselves

1140
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
And not be required to go into a group

1141
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,000
And if we put in this type of content where we say hey you must go into a group to play this

1142
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Then we you know, we have to reconcile that of like hey do we how do we either balance that around

1143
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Solo players do we all as well and if they do the why is it group content or

1144
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Yeah, too bad you have to also be in a group to engage with this and then

1145
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
That puts a lot of pressure on the rewards for that content because if we make the rewards

1146
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Something that a solo player also needs then we're making them go into a group when they may not want to

1147
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Sure

1148
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,000
But if we make the solo or do we make the rewards for that type of content the other way where it's not something you need

1149
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Then why do people do it in the first place? So there's like there's a lot of questions there that are that are new to lead that are tough to answer

1150
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Sure, but I'm really just describing the problem space

1151
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I do think though that overall but the idea of getting with a group of your buddies or random strangers and doing like a 10-man fight on

1152
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
on a huge like you know

1153
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Dungeon or whatever with a boss at the end that requires mechanics like that is really cool and appealing

1154
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
So then that's kind of how I think of it

1155
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
So I got two more quick ones here and I'll pass up to Gazi

1156
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
So in that case then if there's issues related to like having forcing group play basically

1157
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Let's go the other way and say solo cell phone mode now that trading is more common here with legendary items etc

1158
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Have we seen the potential for maybe adding an additional game mode or other game modes

1159
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Um, I think it'd be cool nothing to announce today

1160
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Fair enough next one pvp. There is a small but very passionate pvp community that is curious about further plans

1161
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,000
involving content specifically for these groups of people I promise them I'd ask this one for them

1162
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Whether you're thought some pvp within the game

1163
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
sure um

1164
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Don't have anything to announce when it comes to pvp specific content. I would say we

1165
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I think we would be more interested for from those people like what would they want to see from us?

1166
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I would actually be curious about of like

1167
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:59,000
What do you want? Do you want like an arena type system where we pre-program your gear for you? Do you like open world?

1168
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Do you?

1169
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Do you want some type of different progression system? You know kind of like the group versus solo play the pvp versus pv

1170
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Discussion is a little similar of like the more that we emphasize it or give unique rewards to it

1171
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
The more that we're saying to everybody that doesn't want to do that

1172
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Hey, you must do this to progress your character and that's back to that, you know

1173
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
cursed problem trunk theory like sure

1174
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
You know everything is about power progression

1175
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
So the moment we put power in an activity that's a little more niche

1176
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
then

1177
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
We can really make people unhappy if that's if they have to engage with that

1178
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
So like what would they want to see do they want to see a better way of interacting with pvp?

1179
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Is it just let the balance is crazy because I think that people kind of embrace the crazy balance in dwp?

1180
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Um, but that's where I think I would start the discussion. Thanks for the answer

1181
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
gosh, that's fair

1182
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
When it comes to these questions these rapid five questions we got them from chat and from youtube

1183
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,000
um and one of the questions that we wanted to ask was how can we see how long people have been offline in our plans?

1184
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Climb management issues currently. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1185
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I'm not involved with that group so I can't give it that actually. Don't know

1186
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
But I feel like that's very reasonable. I think we could breathe that back to the team pretty easily

1187
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I will say we do have a team um that works on like UX issues user experience issues

1188
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
And they are the ones that kind of look at stuff like that like you know

1189
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
The ideas that we get over like group power finder or armory party finder

1190
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
This type of support we have a team that's looking at it

1191
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I know that they're working on stuff

1192
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
But I actually don't have complete insight into what they're doing

1193
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
But that seems very reasonable to me

1194
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Stuff I like it

1195
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
The next question is actually about pets in game and we're talking about non combat pets

1196
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Ranging from cosmetics to maybe loot pets that might only loot gold or something. Is that something that's been discussed if so what can you share?

1197
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
We have discussed it. I think it'd be cool. Don't have anything to share

1198
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,000
All right next question would be uh so sorry. Oh go on. I was just gonna breathe the next one

1199
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:57,000
All right, it's just dps meter and dummies. I would love to see that because you can't really see it when you have a minion army hitting a dummy

1200
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I'd like to have dps meters is that something we're gonna see in the future

1201
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Yeah

1202
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Think it's cool. Don't have any two doubts

1203
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Fair enough. I yeah, but I'm actually thinking a little bit more about that

1204
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Maybe feedback would be useful of like is it really only on dummies that you want to do it to test builds or would you want to see in the rest of the game?

1205
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I'm seeing you know dps meters are kind of notorious and other game types

1206
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,000
But I'm not sure that we have the same problems sure of people being upset with each other for not doing as much damage

1207
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
and all that kind of stuff but

1208
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Fair enough. I feel like it probably be fine or at least for a personal one

1209
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I know this one's probably like you can't go anywhere with this but offline mode

1210
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Is there any potential for an offline mode in the oblifore at any point?

1211
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Uh, I have not heard any discussions about it. I would I would doubt it

1212
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Okay, that one I think I'm a little more

1213
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Sure, I could say but I don't see it on the horizon, but fair enough

1214
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Also, I'm not in charge of those kinds of decisions

1215
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,000
glyph leveling and quality of life is there any potential for glyph leveling outside of

1216
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Nightmare dungeons are we're gonna add experience to glyphs elsewhere in the game?

1217
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Uh, we've talked about it a bit

1218
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Nothing to announce. I think

1219
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Kind of going back to that idea with health hides and and whispers

1220
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I think it is cool to have a less efficient way to do something while you're being efficient doing something else

1221
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
That's my personal opinion though and kind of what I what I feel but

1222
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I'm not on the systems team and don't know the nuances of glyph leveling specifically and why we keep it in one place

1223
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
But I wouldn't be surprised I guess is what I would say but I don't have a guarantee there

1224
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:38,000
How about things uh like surprise events like i.e. goblin vaults from d3 for example

1225
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:46,000
You get a ring you go to secondary you can pop out or you know poor those other types of things any surprise ambush related event type of stuff

1226
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
We have the goblin packs for instance. It's pretty cool indeed for rare, but cool

1227
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Yeah, I was I say we've def we've added a couple in season four

1228
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Kind of many events where like you have a chance when you kill an elite and it'll spawn into like a ton of gold or a ton of materials or things or give you way more than normal

1229
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
We like the idea of surprise events. I think you can expect us to make more in the future

1230
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
That is one way kind of like what I think it was uh

1231
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Gaze I think you said of like

1232
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Like we want to break up the monotony and we're trying to make sure that it feels different even though you're doing the same thing

1233
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,000
And I think surprise events is one of the ways that we do that um sometimes it's more successful than others

1234
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,000
But it's definitely something that we want to continue to chase because we think overall it's good. It's just about how exactly did we benefit

1235
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:37,000
That's fair uh what's the team's position on support bills like back in d3 we have cdps demon owners and barb style bills

1236
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Do they have a place in d4 moving forward?

1237
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Hmm that's a good question uh

1238
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I think

1239
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
So but we have to be careful

1240
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
We were a lot more scared about it when we launched the game

1241
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I remember people kept asking that I got him. We can we maybe we're support builds make more things like cross synergies really cool and I agree

1242
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
It's cool

1243
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
um the the other side of that is kind of that

1244
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:06,000
That issue we deal with forever of group versus solo play is that the better we make a support build the more we're saying the best way to play

1245
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
This game is to go with four people support your friends and you get multiplicative

1246
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Massively increased amounts of output right so uh

1247
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I think we do what we do want it we have it a little bit with barbarian shouts right and we've even had added some

1248
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Legendaries that do it like there's a druid one that turns your blood howl into an aoe buff

1249
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
um

1250
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
But I don't think it's it's one of those we have to walk the line very carefully

1251
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I think because it can be very detrimental to the game if we go too far

1252
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
But I'm not against it as an idea at all

1253
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Okay, I'll jump over to the next one real quick with the opening community events

1254
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Way back like blizzard a key openings in bull of warcraft for example

1255
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Community designs a legendary any sort of that community events surrounding those things what you thoughts on that

1256
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I think it'd be awesome. Uh, I'm not against it at all

1257
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,000
But those are checks that I can't cash so yeah, I would love to I'm not gonna make it

1258
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:06,000
But yes, I would love an acu event like that in in d4 or something or even community making the let community making a legendary

1259
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Oh, how scared am I of that?

1260
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Are you unique? I don't know probably but we could find a way to balance it out. I don't know

1261
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
I think it'd be cool. I think it'd be neat. Yeah, I'm on board

1262
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I'm gonna throw you a quick one with something that's close to my heart and that's map overlay

1263
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And before you say immersion I'd like to say that a lot of people will say

1264
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Let us play the game we want to what's the thoughts of map overlay moving forward?

1265
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Hmm

1266
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:38,000
This is personal atom atom thoughts not company thoughts because everybody has different opinions

1267
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I think and we've talked about map overlay internally quite a bit um

1268
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
I think map overlay

1269
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,000
It's one of those where there's there's such obvious pros and cons and I think different types of players really

1270
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Really want to engage in different ways. I personally am not completely against a map overlay being in the game

1271
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
But I understand why there are there are people that feel strongly that you know

1272
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
We really don't want to try and make a game where you're looking at your map the whole time and not all this

1273
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Beautiful world and art and things that we've created to try and immerse the player and then they're so into the systems

1274
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
And the efficiency game that we pull them out of it and I think it kind of goes back to kind of what you said of like

1275
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
You know a RPGs we really want you to

1276
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
We know it's an efficiency game, but we don't want it to feel

1277
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
That exposed all the time that you must feel pressured to do

1278
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Things perfectly all the time and a map overlay

1279
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
pushes that pretty hard

1280
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
um

1281
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:38,000
So I see both sides. I think I'm a little bit personally in favor of just having it because people want it

1282
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
But I understand

1283
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
It changes the game pretty fundamentally for a lot of people and there's a pressure there now

1284
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,000
It's got like DPS meters in many games too. I would equate it to like the moment you introduce that you kind of can't go back

1285
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
And you've changed how people interact with your game forever

1286
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
And so I even if people want it I see why it

1287
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Exit tough topic

1288
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
We're actually doing pretty good on time. We're almost through the rapid fire

1289
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,000
We's got a few more here and then we pretty much are gg out the way out the door here

1290
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:09,000
So uh ultimate button is something gets brought a lot people have asked can we get separate button for the ultimate

1291
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Yeah

1292
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Maybe I'll say I'll explain the problem space of why yeah

1293
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,000
So when when we're thinking about Diablo and why we don't have

1294
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
More extra buttons or like an ultimate button or whatever is that we we

1295
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:34,000
We thought heavily and work long and hard uh deciding the number of buttons that you're gonna have total on your bar at all

1296
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:41,000
And those buttons were determined by thinking of how many different actions do we want a player to worry about at any given time

1297
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,000
And right now we have you know you have a Vade you have potion

1298
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:49,000
You have your regular ones on your bar and then your core and your basic right if you have a basic um

1299
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Adding another button is something that we could do. I mean controller issues aside and making that feel good uh

1300
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,000
It's a matter of how complex do we want to expect every single player to interact and at the time at launching the game

1301
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:09,000
We we were as old back and forth with this a lot and are at the at the time our idea was we were rather have something like an avade button

1302
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:15,000
That really uh everybody can use and makes the game feel very different and it's kind of like this is very different than other RPGs

1303
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Um then a specific ultimate button

1304
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:24,000
There's also would need to be a lot of rebalancing of ultimates when we fully expect people to have one versus that they can choose whether or not they do

1305
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Uh that work we could do I think it's more of like

1306
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Do I want to balance and and design everything assuming a player has an ultimate in addition to all of their other skills

1307
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
And what that means to how we have to change ultimates or do other things um

1308
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I think it's doable, but I don't know that I'm very excited about the prospect unless there's a very clear win

1309
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Okay, I can understand that a couple just fast ones

1310
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Don't have to go and depth on just some transmog things people are asking maybe a color wheel for transmogs

1311
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
It's supposed to just like red green blue when any thoughts on adding like a color wheel

1312
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Yeah, that seems cool

1313
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
It's not my guarantee, but yeah

1314
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Non horse mounts pretty much all the mounts are horses. Can we get like a maggot or any anything of spider?

1315
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I think I think we should and I wouldn't be surprised if we did it

1316
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:15,000
But I'm not involved in those conversations, but I I think I personally feel like it's a no-brainer

1317
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Yeah, same. Same. I agree. I'm glad we agree on okay, uh wings kind of controversial, but a million people ask me

1318
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Wings are we ever gonna see wings in D4? Yeah, that's a little more controversial uh

1319
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I would say I don't know about the future. I can explain a little bit of where we're at now

1320
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:36,000
And I'm not even completely involved in this is a little bit of my opinion because I I didn't make these decisions

1321
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:42,000
But you know return to darkness was one of our big guiding philosophies when we when we were making D4 up to launch

1322
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:47,000
And this idea that hey this game is is you know going back to kind of D1 D2 routes of being scary and

1323
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:53,000
And a little more you know through some and dark and dreary and we even try even with the combat

1324
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:58,000
That's why we have a vade is like you have to dodge attacks and really plan because this world is dangerous

1325
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Um in some ways we've learned that players, you know want to blast and they don't care as much

1326
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
uh

1327
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
As we maybe we like we over indexed a little bit on it

1328
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:13,000
We still but it is still something that we care about so like now it's does we like before Wings was kind of in that

1329
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
It's making the game a little bit. It doesn't fit the vibe we're going for but we we've moved a bit

1330
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,000
But have we moved enough that Wings are okay now? I don't know fair enough

1331
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
I'm it's like we're I think we're right there. I could I could see it be in either way

1332
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
But I that just explains kind of how we got here so fair enough

1333
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
I get that we only got like three questions left here really

1334
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,000
So the last transmog related or cosmic relay question is can we get cosmetics potentially for minions?

1335
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I know gauzy probably would like this one

1336
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Uh, I think it would be cool. It's a lot harder to do for minions and for players though

1337
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Or even like a Wings because you can have a million minions on your screen and and how loud that is is a concern

1338
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,000
But I don't think it's an impossibility. I'd like to see it. I think it'd be cool

1339
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Same with your transfer and transmogs. I think would be cool, but that's just my opinion

1340
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
All right, um, no for a gauzy

1341
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Speaking of being ob scary

1342
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
What about a unicorn level?

1343
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:10,000
towel level is that ever something that's going to happen because we've all been hunting for it

1344
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
A unicorn level that sounds neat. I don't know what you're talking about with the other one

1345
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
There it is

1346
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
And uh shout out to racks uber tomb lord win

1347
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Uh, I think it could be cool. I'm down

1348
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Uh, whatever people want to fight. I mean we could make it

1349
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,000
All right, and we pretty much are hitting the end of the time here. Um, I want to thank you for your time

1350
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I will submit there's a couple other like bug reports. I'll just DM over as well and then we skip those ones

1351
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
And uh, you know, we just had a 45 minutes. So I appreciate the time

1352
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Thanks for answering all the questions

1353
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:50,000
And uh, we actually managed to get through pretty much the entire list including the rapid fire. So you done good

1354
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,000
So I'm not I appreciate it. Yeah, you know, any last words or anything you want to say?

1355
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Um, I would say no first thanks to both of you for taking the time to talk to me

1356
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
If you really enjoy these conversations, I look forward to doing more

1357
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Um, for everybody else, you know, one of the things I'm really passionate about like first, you know

1358
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Go listen to that convert that to that presentation that I talked about on a cursed problems

1359
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,000
I really one of my goals with getting in front of people and talking with them

1360
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:20,000
And I've done this ever since I started as a developer you can go look at interviews with me years ago from heroes

1361
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:26,000
But I like having better discussions with you all and with players that are a little more informed

1362
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
So as people get passionate and want to learn about game design

1363
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,000
You know, it's easy just to be like hey, why don't you add this and we can answer those questions

1364
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:39,000
But I like more in depth ones and we do on the team of like hey, why does this work the way it does and can we find a way to make it work and get we

1365
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:45,000
What we want right like when you counter back at me with like the strong colds question like can we okay out of I listen to you

1366
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
I understand your problem space now that I thought about it

1367
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Can we do this and why or why not like that to me is a better discussion and a better culture a better

1368
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Of better world really if I want to get sappy of like

1369
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,000
You know be informed we're talking about things and care about it and think about it

1370
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,000
And don't just blast like hey, just do this right? Yeah, I mean I want to answer those

1371
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:12,000
But I saw like I was saying everyone has to get I just mean like if you care enough to really want to know

1372
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
like you know

1373
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Think about it and have real discussion. So I want to be a force for that

1374
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I guess in the community and I think other people on our team do as well. So thanks

1375
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,000
But I really enjoyed the time. So enjoy talking with you both

1376
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
I enjoyed it. I appreciate you enjoying Asian

1377
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,000
It was it was actually nice seeing the thought process behind it

1378
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:36,000
And like it kind of in real time because normally it's like you make a video maybe you get response about there's something

1379
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,000
It is kind of nice to see like in real time the feedback because you're right just during the very brief conversation about strong

1380
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Code it's like it did actually I'm like oh you know it makes sense. It's a consumable design thing

1381
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Kind of hard to turn into a repetitive experience. So thank you for opening up about that guys

1382
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
You got any last comments or thing you want to say?

1383
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Not really. I mean, I know you're a minion lover. So

1384
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,000
I want to get in on a deep dive talk with you some day about that

1385
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
We do that on stream on this haven't talked some day as well

1386
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Maybe we can someday know. Yeah, I my roots are an RTS where I manage a million little units

1387
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
And I love minion stuff and everything so

1388
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
That's good, but thanks for joining appreciate it

1389
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
All right. Yeah, thank you both very much. Well, let's you. We'll let you head on out the door here

1390
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
We'll wrap up and uh, all right. We're gonna cut back to the other screen and then

1391
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Cut the audio and I will be back in just a moment everybody. Okay

1392
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Yeah

1393
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
You

1394
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
You

1395
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Sorry, yeah, I'm back. I was respawn. Ah

1396
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:41,000
All right, so we're back. Uh, we got through basically all of the questions

1397
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Uh, that we were able to dig up that got honed down

1398
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,000
So there were some in there that like bug reports and some other stuff that we were able to get

1399
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:56,000
I'm significant amount of the questions during the rapid fire. I think he went like four or five minutes over time as well

1400
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Just which was pretty cool. So that was nice

1401
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
um, but we are

1402
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Interviews completed

1403
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:10,000
W if you like the interview L if you hated it and you think we all suck and uh, that was pretty much the gg on there

1404
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I am actually curious what question you guys were the most interested in and I'll do the same thing here

1405
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I'll put up a straw poll and we'll see how you guys actually felt about it

1406
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
up

1407
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I'll put in a few of them

1408
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,000
That seems like pretty good feedback on it a couple people hated it other than that seemed like pretty good

1409
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I'll put a straw poll up. We can actually get like a response you guys can see in there. Thanks for the five

1410
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Okay, option one

1411
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,000
I'm gonna add a bunch of options in here. I'll put a link and you guys can vote on it

1412
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
It was great. It was good was mid

1413
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Was bad and then was horrible

1414
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
So there's gonna be a variety of these being

1415
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
launch that

1416
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:58,000
And let's see what the feedback of it actually is

1417
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:04,000
And I I'm actually pretty satisfied myself personally. I thought it went pretty decent

1418
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
So

1419
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
I'm surprised we ever to get through all the questions

1420
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:13,000
I will admit I was a little worried we were not gonna have enough time to get through all of the questions

1421
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Um, but we kind of blasted through there at the end

1422
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Which was nice. Hopefully we didn't go too fast and then we were able to actually

1423
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Keep up with it here. Okay, let me go ahead and grab there's the straw poll

1424
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Boom throw that on screen

1425
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Bang. Okay, here you go. So I'm gonna put the links in the chat

1426
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,000
There you go go ahead and vote on how you felt about the interview

1427
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
You

1428
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
There you go

1429
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Mostly positive response about an eight or nine percent people didn't like it

1430
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Glad we spent the time we did going through the prep. Yeah

1431
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Yeah, I thought you had them to a really good job explaining the philosophy behind it and like tackling the questions that we were kind of curious about

1432
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I keep it shy away from the questions. There wasn't very many like oh, I can't really answer that like it was

1433
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Actually kind of like did his best to actually take a shot at them

1434
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Which I'm glad for I was I was hoping it was gonna be something like that was

1435
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Didn't want to be asking questions that we're gonna get anywhere

1436
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Okay

1437
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Okay, that seems like pretty good reception

1438
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Now interview of the other interviewers about the interview. Yeah, do we need interview section here

1439
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Now we need riker and racks and we all just seven group interviewing each other

1440
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:57,000
About how we felt about each one of our interviews for the the ultimate live stream reaction section

1441
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Enjoyed the discussion on philosophy except their why bother other words otherwise

1442
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I do enjoy actually hearing the thought process behind when they're developing the game itself

1443
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Actually though around table over four seasons four lawns would be nice

1444
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Yeah, that'd be cool

1445
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Shout out to my boy Gazi also let me put a link to Gazi's channel if you're looking to watch the VOD itself

1446
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Um, we will be posting just the cut out

1447
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Interview of that on Gazi TV's channel as well. So I'm gonna have a link to that. I'll put down below

1448
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
There you go. Otherwise

1449
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
You can see it here in the live stream VODs boats on twitch and youtube

1450
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:56,000
You Gazi Crip as mingo woody joe and racks go go go do that's a ton of people around table

1451
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I

1452
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Hope everyone listens to Adam see back what kind of questions asked for the next round of interviews

1453
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
It is harder. I feel like it's harder than it seems

1454
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
To prepare questions that you think can actually get answers

1455
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
because

1456
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
When you're asking them

1457
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:20,000
You try to do things that are gonna open up the conversation and actually because you the point is you want to be able to hear right you want to actually be able to hear

1458
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
What people are saying

1459
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Or what they're thinking when they're developing the game you don't just want to hear like our charms coming to the game

1460
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Yes or no like you kind of do want to hear the thought process behind it so try to balance those with just getting factual responses as well

1461
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,000
People were saying horrible or bad or just ask those of the chat. I mean there's a

1462
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
There's a pretty limited number of people that were being a problem

1463
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,000
And cheflack everyone was actually pretty pretty nice and chat for the most bit

1464
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Color acts for general discussion that is up to him if you want to do you can bring me

1465
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Six hours of asmingo reacting yeah you guys can catch this interview also in asmingo's react for

1466
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
The next 12 hours maybe

1467
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
What up waffles thomper do that name

1468
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Gazi was good in this one. Yeah, I thought so. Gazi had some good questions

1469
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
The only critical thing I'd say about the interview is I feel a bit rushed that's fair because

1470
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,000
It actually was rushed we did kind of have to move along the the

1471
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
We had to move along the questions

1472
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Um, we couldn't we couldn't sit on the topic for too long even though I was enjoying the conversation personally around stronghodes for instance

1473
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,000
I did need to move the conversation the long quicker so we kind of had to

1474
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:08,000
We we had to cut it because if each question is 15 minutes we will have only got the first three but we were able to get about 20 in

1475
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
So I'll take it

1476
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Are you posting on youtube today or later

1477
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:21,000
The vod is currently being uploaded to a google drive which gazi will upload on the channel that was linked

1478
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
There's also the live stream vod that I have today

1479
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:30,000
But you will have to pick through it to find it and we're going me and the editor are going to after this live stream record a recap video

1480
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
And which I do shorter simnopses

1481
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,000
So if you don't want to watch a fo 45 minutes there'll be a recap video shortly after this stream ends

1482
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:42,000
I'm going to sit down and record one with the editor in which will be like I asked this

1483
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,000
This was the response and like paraphrase effectively

1484
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:02,000
SSF coming I think that was the one that maybe perhaps we could

1485
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Receive as the most information leaked maybe I mean you said can't confirm anything but we like it type of situation so

1486
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
um ssf sounds like it could be coming yeah

1487
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Wish for more backfiring on the devs bad takes not like adding one bonus main skill tree because players can't handle it mistakes

1488
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,000
I don't think it matters what I think about what somebody else is saying

1489
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I think what matters is that you get to hear more questions

1490
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:34,000
related to what they think about questions you would ask if you had the chance

1491
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:39,000
So I could be like well, I think that's a dumb take I think players can handle an ultimate button

1492
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:44,000
But what do you as the viewer actually gain from me snapping back at him

1493
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:51,000
You basically instead gaining something you lose one additional question answer during that time

1494
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:56,000
So I choose to not respond unless it's a critical point in which I was extremely curious

1495
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,000
So I couldn't help myself asking about for instance the uber strong holds when we got into that conversation

1496
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Um outside of that

1497
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I I don't think it's really worth time like arguing with people

1498
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Because I don't really think that I'm the one developing the game now am I

1499
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:19,000
The job is to pull information out not try to teach him the job that he's doing right which I mean he's the one doing the job

1500
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Not me. I didn't go to school for game dev

1501
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
So I actually do listen to what he says

1502
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Where's that poll the poll is right here

1503
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
I'll hold on that's gots use the link to the channel. Let me put this here

1504
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
There's the poll

1505
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Joe says tons of people take every genre because they don't understand the skill tree as it is yeah

1506
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:01,000
That's probably true. I think d4 you have to realize as a much wider audience than any of the previous diablo games

1507
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
But I don't think they

1508
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I don't think they necessarily will stop progression of something like that

1509
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Just because some people don't know how the skill tree works. I'm sure that there will be continued progression

1510
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:25,000
What was the name of the video we told us to go watch about the game dev you have to back up to see it in the vod

1511
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I don't actually remember the name of it

1512
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Trichest bit of interviewing is active listening not worrying about your next question took me a bit stop doing that with my production brain

1513
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Yeah, you have to like listen and be able to follow up

1514
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Um, in order to actually have a good conversation. I agree that part can be difficult

1515
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:53,000
There you go Jim has the link to the curse problems and game design. I'll link that on YouTube side of things too for the people that are curious over there

1516
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
You

1517
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Sounds like the pvp folks need to speak up more. Yes more will be once what sounds like they haven't been hearing

1518
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Yeah, I uh, I did ask for the pvp

1519
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I I knew when I asking that that half the people were gonna be like what a waste and stupid question for the people

1520
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
They don't give a fuck about pvp

1521
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,000
But there's enough pvp players that like I wanted to get that one in there for you

1522
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I'm sorry that we weren't able to get like well

1523
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:35,000
This is the next game of coming but like you know, you got what if you guys really do care about pvp

1524
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:41,000
It sounds like they're not giving enough feedback about that. So you need to put feedback in for that. That's what it sounds like

1525
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:52,000
What was the feature you personally would like to see come to d4 and why just curious

1526
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
That's a good question

1527
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Why since we're on the pvp topic the thing that mainly comes to my head is you know how in lost arc there is a

1528
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
pvp

1529
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Arena that's like one v one v one basically. I think that that is

1530
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
pretty

1531
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
phenomenal

1532
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I like that like the elimination style it'd be cool if you could create a character

1533
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:19,000
It's like level 100 max out gear separate from like your actual one and have only a pvp character

1534
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,000
That would go into a one v one v one arena that would be pretty cool. I'm not or like a moba style or not moba

1535
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,000
But like a battle right style where I'll drop you into like plunderstorm. I think that would be pretty cool

1536
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
um

1537
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
But yeah, that's just because my brains on pvp right now

1538
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
I

1539
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Will Smith be back to blizzard their forms read a post anywhere that stuff is heard discord

1540
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Didn't mention mercenaries followers though. Yeah, I think I think that one had been covered already we did go into pets

1541
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Yeah balance issue is one problem with pvp as well yet

1542
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:03,000
You're thoughts on d4 adding a new class. I think people would love to see a new class. I think that's

1543
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Uh, pre self evident a lot of people would love to see it

1544
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:17,000
What about cow level answer he gave like why he said exactly what I said they would say

1545
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Which is effectively

1546
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
What's a cow level we have no idea

1547
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:29,000
So vod available anywhere the vod is on youtube as well as on twitch you can find it on both platforms

1548
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
All right

1549
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:51,000
We had to not play in stupid. That's the ongoing joke like the so the cow level joke is is it's an ongoing gag

1550
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Of basically you you say like what's a cow level

1551
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
And then they say oh with a cow level is this

1552
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
That's effectively out goes

1553
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
There is no cow level yeah exactly

1554
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
You frankly alive with the priming very much

1555
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Okay, so shout out to all the people that watch this on twitch as well as youtube

1556
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I appreciate you guys will probably do more youtube live streams going in the future for the start of season four

1557
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
If you have any interest in those you can hit the bell

1558
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:35,000
It will notify you when the live streams go live they probably be right around the same time as we did this one today as well

1559
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I appreciate all the people that show that pretty good amount of people that did show up today

1560
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Looks like most people enjoyed the interview

1561
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Thank you for all your questions and for helping to the interview through the last 24 hours

1562
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:55,000
As we did the previous one also any questions unload out that was covered by raxons previous interview

1563
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:03,000
So I'm going to wrap it up. I'm going to go record a sort of highlights video talking about the recap of what we actually saw

1564
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
And then from there I will see you guys later

1565
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
