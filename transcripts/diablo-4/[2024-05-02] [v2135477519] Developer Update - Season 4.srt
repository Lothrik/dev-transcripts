1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Season 4 is going to be the biggest update we have ever made to Diablo 4 since it has launched.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Our focus on Season 4 is to really make a lot of evergreen updates to the core systems of Diablo 4.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In Season 4, we're ramping the intensity across the seasonal and eternal realms through a collection of new activities aimed at ensuring the moment-to-moment gameplay experience is as exciting and rewarding when HAL comes to Sanctuary.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Season 4 item changes are some of the biggest changes we've made to Diablo 4 thus far.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We've never done anything like this. We are fundamentally changing how you engage with items, how you upgrade them, and along the way, solving a lot of things that we've seen continually from our community that we agree with are pain points of our existing item system right now.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So in this new itemization system, we're focusing on narrowing down the scope of the base affixes.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They're going to be a lot simpler, they're going to be fewer in number, so you can much more easily parse whether this item is useful for you, and if it is, then you can take it and further upgrade it and customize it to your own specific build.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Tempering is a new system that allows you to really customize the gear that you find.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In order to temper, you will need to go to the blacksmith and then choose the recipe that you wish to temper from, and then a random affix from that recipe will be attached onto your gear.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Tempering recipes can be found from almost all of the content throughout Sanctuaries.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So you will actually be looking for tempering recipes that go directly with what you're envisioning.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Maybe you're thinking, I'm going to play a Frost Sorceress.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
There are also going to be recipes that are more generic and maybe are just generally good for the Sorceress, but you'll be able to choose which one you think is going to be most powerful with the build you're making for your class.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We're making a pretty radical change to the Codex of Power in this season, based again on the feedback that has been coming from our players.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now, every single legendary in the game will be entered into your Codex of Power so that you can continually imprint the best possible version of that legendary onto your gear.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So going forward, there will no longer be carrying around all of these Aspect Crystals in your inventory. It's all going to be in the Codex of Power.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So part of the final system that we have is going to be greater affixes. What's a greater affix?

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, we want to keep it compelling that there are some drops that are even better than the others when you're trying to get the perfect build at endgame.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Because of this, in World Tier 4 and only in World Tier 4, when an Ancestral Legendary item drops, there's a chance the affixes on it can roll as greater affixes.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
These will roll with bigger values that are normally available for that affix.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Greater affixes are fairly rare, but they're not impossible to find. While leveling up, you're going to be able to find upgrades much more easily with this new system.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Another part of itemization is going to be Masterworking. Now this is something really intended for that very high endgame, again, World Tier 4.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is where a player is going to take an item, already has the affixes that they want on it, but now they go through a process of upgrading those affixes, getting even higher values on them.

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Masterworking really starts at level 100. Once you've already completed your build and found some of the best items, you're going to be able to test your build and get the best of the best of the best of the best.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Pit is a new endgame system that has been added in this season that is going to challenge players that feel that they have largely maximized their build.

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
By pushing into more difficult tiers of the Pit, you're going to be able to unlock rarer crafting materials to masterwork your gear even further.

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're going to have to play some of the hardest content in the game, but once you do, if you're successful, you can go and make those affixes even stronger.

28
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:25,000
In Season 4, we're ramping the intensity of the Helltides through the inclusion of a variety of new activities. The first of which is a doubling down and rise of the Cultists' presence throughout the Tide.

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're going to be running through the Helltide seeing the Cultists just conjuring up swarms and swarms of demons, adding to that sense of mannequin chaos that they're pretty well known for.

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The other archetype that we're adding is the presence of the Doomsayers, who were unfortunate enough to be caught out in the Tide and basically just lost their minds to all of the mania going on around them.

31
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And lastly, rounding out the new activities are just the inclusion of the Iron Wolves. They're finally joining the fight. They could no longer stand in the sidelines, seeing the Helltides and Hells forces intensify their assault on Sanctuary.

32
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:18,000
As Season 4 players engage and progress through the Cultists' Seasonal Activity, they'll earn honor with the Iron Wolves, unlocking access to a vast assortment of rewards to accompany and empower your Season 4 journeys.

33
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:32,000
In the update of Helltide for players who are able to stay alive long enough, they'll be paid a visit by the Hellborn, former Heroes of Sanctuary who have aligned with the forces of Hell to attack the allies they once aligned with.

34
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Players who are able to take down the Hellborn will be acquiring the materials they need to engage with the new premier Helltide activity, the Accursed Rituals.

35
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Located in the Helltide, these Accursed Rituals are pretty much just botched rituals from the Cultists that players will be kickstarting for themselves, drawing the intention of all the nearby Helltide monsters in this kind of all-out battle.

36
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:07,000
One of my favorite themes for these ambushes is the Hellworm. It's literally a giant Hell slug beast that emerges from the ground and spews out a whole bunch of mobs at you.

37
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you're able to survive that, you'll be paid a visit from the Blood Maiden, our brand new Helltide mini-boss and one of the ultimate challenges in the new experience.

38
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I think I'm actually most excited about this season because of what you're able to do with your old characters.

39
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How they can integrate with this new item game and take them to new levels of power with this system.

40
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think that the best part of this update is that you're going to be really empowered to build the character that you want to play.

41
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You're going to be able to pick custom affixes and enhance your character in a lot of new and interesting ways.

42
00:06:42,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Alright. We were just watching a video and everyone's finger gunning the screen for no reason.

43
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm just swinging the screen and everyone's like, what are you doing Adam?

44
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, okay.

45
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hey guys, how's it going? Welcome to another Diablo 4 Developer Update livestream.

46
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
My name is Adam Fletcher. I am the Community Director here for Diablo.

47
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm joined by this wonderful panel plus an additional head which we will haul out.

48
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We only have four seats.

49
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Only have four seats.

50
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We have to swap people around.

51
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We have to do the same thing we did during the PTR stream which was like we swapped out like Joe Shelley.

52
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We put in Adam Jackson.

53
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's true. We did do that.

54
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So we're going to play more magic tricks today.

55
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But do you guys want to do a quick intro to yourself to the wonderful Diablo community?

56
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sure. I'm Joe Paipora. I'm the Associate Game Director for Diablo 4.

57
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And I'm Adam Jackson, the Lead Live Class Designer for Diablo 4.

58
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And we have a new face.

59
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hello. I'm Colin Feiner. I'm the Lead Live Game Designer.

60
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Awesome. And then we're actually going to be joined by Derek.

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Who are you?

62
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, well I already introduced myself.

63
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, sorry.

64
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You just missed it.

65
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I know. I'm our screen is up there.

66
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I know. Terrible.

67
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's my first stream.

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But we actually have Derek who will be joining us as well.

69
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Derek you just saw in the video prior talking about Season 4.

70
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He'll be swapping in to talk a little bit more about Helltides later in this.

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But big stream here.

72
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We have Season 4 coming up.

73
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
As you guys saw earlier this week it is Loot Reborn for Season 4.

74
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And a lot of players actually got to experience it a couple weeks ago with PTR.

75
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
PTR, this was our first Diablo 4 PTR.

76
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It was a massive undertaking from the team here.

77
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But it was really, really great to have players jump in early.

78
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Check out Season 4 and all the changes and actually provide feedback.

79
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And so we have a lot to cover today based off of feedback that we received from players from PTR itself.

80
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So, but Joe I know you wanted to jump into kind of talking a little bit more about Season 4, how PTR went before we jump into all the changes.

81
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, happy to.

82
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So, okay, so last time we were on stream we were actually talking about a lot of the changes that players are going to get a chance to check out on the PTR.

83
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So we think that went really, really well.

84
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It was even just having the week of time for players to like just jump in and just crush through all of the content.

85
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Check out all of the new features and it gets a lot of feedback.

86
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Find a lot of bugs along the way as well.

87
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It was again, super valuable.

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's been really, really great for the team.

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We'll take a lot of these, this feedback, look at the tuning variety of features and really make sure that we've got the best version of the Season 4 experience ready when we get into the launch today.

90
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So, you know, in terms of like our big takeaways, first of all, really, really valuable across the board.

91
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Season 4, Season of Loot Reborn was, as I mentioned during the PTR stream originally, was really our opportunity to go back and take a lot of the feedback in that we've been looking at since the launch of the game from 2023.

92
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This art is so good.

93
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I do love the key art for this.

94
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This key art for Season 3 was awesome as well.

95
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's awesome.

96
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah.

97
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So, yes.

98
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So, looking back at the...

99
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thanks for disrupting my flow.

100
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
David Paz's art is amazing.

103
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So, yeah, looking back at the launch of the other products in 2023, you know, we've been getting a lot of really good feedback.

104
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You remember back in Season 2, Season of Blood, you know, we made a big change to like vulnerable damage and like the multiplicative damage that comes along with it.

105
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We made a change to the way the Elemental Resist worked.

106
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yep.

107
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And there were a lot of things we had to do to make those changes like really shine through.

108
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There's like a lot of Paragon nodes that had to get updated.

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There were a lot of like legendary aspects that had to get changed.

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There was just a lot of itemization stuff in the background that we had to do to make those systems work better and lift up other things around them like overpower, for example, to make that feel like it was in a better spot.

111
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So now that we're looking at like even when we were done that one big release for Season of Blood, we knew that there was a lot more that we wanted to do.

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Again, we've been thinking about, but there's a lot of work we need to do, like make sure that all of these things really all fit together cohesively.

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So, I mean, as people got a chance to see on the PTR, like the introduction of things like the tempering feature, which we're going to talk a little bit more in a minute.

114
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We get to like introduce these new like affixes into items.

115
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And affixes you can't get on items anymore.

116
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The reduction affix count on items overall.

117
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So it's a lot easier to go and sort through 25 pairs of gloves in your inventory at any given time.

118
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We don't really have those same situations.

119
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We reduced the number of items that drop in the game experience overall, but made sure that the items that are dropping are just more valuable and more likely to be upgrades for you or something you can kind of like build into an upgrade.

120
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We introduced the master working feature, right?

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And Colin helps head a lot of these things up, right, during working with the teams.

122
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So they introduced the master working feature where, you know, players can continually upgrade items to increase the value of the affixes and then, you know, at ranks 4 and 8 and 12, you get to like kind of crit on one of these and make them even better.

123
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You know, there's a lot of things that were introduced.

124
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We added the new content type in the form of the Pivvy Artificer.

125
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's like this new like, you know, extremely deep and deadly dungeon dive players get to go into once they get into the, like towards the end game when you're getting to like, you know, 85, 90 for your character level.

126
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're starting to kind of dip into that space and that's where you go to get your master working materials which feels really, really good.

127
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And we learned a lot of really great lessons from like Greater Rifts in Diablo 3 because we think there was some really cool content there.

128
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So there's some really, really fun things there.

129
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And then also...

130
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Also the Codex of Power updates.

131
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You no longer have to save all your legendaries all the time.

132
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Codex of Power updates, which I was like, to be fair, I've been kind of, I've been so excited about the Codex of Power updates.

133
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I've been teasing it for like six live streams.

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah.

135
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Like it's not, like before BlizzCon I feel like I teased it at the end of a live stream.

136
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So it's just what it is.

137
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But again, super excited about the Codex of Power changes.

138
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That is very transformational.

139
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Like now when Legendary drops on the ground for you, you just salvage it, you get that aspect, put it into your Codex, add the role that you got, and you just get to use it in perpetuity.

140
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And we actually have some fun ways, we'll talk about later, how we're playing with that a little bit as we go.

141
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, I mean, all of this stuff and more, we've made huge, huge changes to Helltide.

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I know Derek's been talking about it in a little while.

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
As he helped lead the team, did a lot of the work for that.

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And we got to introduce the season theme in the form of like, Loot Reborn.

145
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And then the reintroduction of the Iron Wolves mercenaries, the players we've been working with during the course of the release.

146
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I know that we showed a little bit of that off a lot earlier.

147
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And I am just, personally I'm just really, really excited about the release overall.

148
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
As this was an opportunity for us to work with like, not just the season team, but also the live team.

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And like, a lot of support from the systems groups.

150
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And there's a lot of things being done for, you know, the expansion, you know, that's coming out eventually as well.

151
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Like, Vessel of Hatred.

152
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So, being able to like, really organize teams and make sure that we're in a really, really good spot to like, provide this really big update for the game.

153
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Has been very, very exciting.

154
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And the feedback, going back to the feedback.

155
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The feedback from PTR was, again, really, really valuable.

156
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It was great to get players in there and to get those things taken care of.

157
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And we're going to talk about some of those things today.

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I know that some of this information has been like, we talked to like a few, like, press outlets.

159
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We talked to a few different people.

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And like, some information is getting out there.

161
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But I want to make sure we can provide a little bit more detail.

162
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You know, because I know this is the audience that wants to know like, the real specifics.

163
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We're going to get into it, right?

164
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah.

165
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And we'll also have our Q&A as we usually do at the end.

166
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We're going to like, answer some more questions the community might have as we kind of go through the whole thing.

167
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So, yeah.

168
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That was the, at a high level, that's what we were feeling about the PTR.

169
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Feeling pretty good about it.

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm happy to like, maybe jump into itemization or how do we want to go through it?

171
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah.

172
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I think the first thing we probably want to talk about is like, the itemization changes that are in Season 4 that people experience.

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Which includes like, the tempering, the master working stuff that changed in Season 4.

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And of course, all the feedback that we got from both tempering, master working, and what we are planning on doing based off of that PTR feedback for the launch of Season 4.

175
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah, we've had a few updates.

176
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So, lots.

177
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, sure.

178
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So, I guess just starting off then with like, high level itemization.

179
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Like, let's go back to like, some of the goals that we had.

180
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And we started like, down on this, started some of the work for Season 4.

181
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Now, we want to make sure that, first, players were having an easier time comparing items in their inventory.

182
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's actually one of the first things we started thinking about when we began discussing what we thought needed to change about itemization.

183
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Because the experience in Season 3 and Season 2 and other seasons has really been, like, the player, you know, you'll get into like, you know, you're running your high tier nightmare dungeons.

184
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're getting lots of drops.

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You know, you're sorting through all of this stuff.

186
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Like, you'll have like, items that are like, you know, this is like a 904 I-Power sword.

187
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And this is a 909 I-Power sword.

188
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Now, I've got like, six helmets at all.

189
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Or, like, have a wide variety of affixes on them.

190
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We really wanted to, again, just to quickly hit this, we wanted to make sure that we had a lower number of affixes overall that could roll on different item slots.

191
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But those affixes were more like, generically useful and stuff you could really build around.

192
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
As opposed to having lots of really conditional affixes going back to like the, you know, the damage on Tuesday's joke.

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know, like that's...

194
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The shirt that Mr. Adam Jackson is wearing.

195
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The shirt that we're literally wearing it now.

196
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Literally wearing it.

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not as funny if you see it wrong.

198
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's always funny.

199
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So it's obviously because it's a joke, right?

200
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Jokes are always funny.

201
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But the truth is, like, we wanted to make sure that...

202
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Where we wanted to have conditional affixes in the game, we wanted to find places where players would be able to opt into them in a very specific way.

203
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You know, so initially we want items that are really dropping for you to have more generic utility, just be more valuable for you overall.

204
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And also, as a result of this, make it easier to compare those items.

205
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So one of the changes that we made is we actually reduced the number of affixes that can naturally roll on item slots.

206
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So like now, like, you know, a rare item can roll like two affixes, a legendary egg can roll three affixes.

207
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But then later on, there's other systems you get to introduce, we'll talk about in a bit, it lets you introduce more of those.

208
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And we did that, so it's just easier to go through things.

209
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
We also made all items post level 100 925, so you're no longer comparing, like, the designer number that's like 904 to 925.

210
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're just focusing on what's cool about the item, which is the affixes.

211
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yeah, which is super important, because there's a lot of situations where, like, if you're level 100, like Blood Harvest might be a lot of fun, but Blood Harvest is still dropping like iPower 900 items for you.

212
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And at that point, why would you want to keep even Blood Harvest, which players really love, like why would you want to keep engaging with it if you can't get really good end game items format?

213
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

214
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So now when you're like at level 100 and you're playing in Helltide, or if you're going through Nightmare Dungeons, like a regular, like a slightly lower tier and you're fighting, level 100 monsters are higher, you're always getting iPower 925 items.

215
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
They might not have all exactly the stats or exactly the rolls that you want, but you're always getting stuff you could actually potentially use.

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah, a lot of the things feel a lot better too, like gambling, right? Like now gambling is actually a really great source for targeting item slot, because all of those are 925 at level 100.

217
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's right. So like the opals that you've been sitting on where you go and you just churn through a whole bunch of these at once, they didn't have as much generic value.

218
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Now they're a lot better because you really can just like say, I am looking for a helmet, I am looking for a ring, and you can just go roll, you know, 10 iPower 925 rings in a row, and you have stuff to play with then at that point.

219
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So yeah, those were some of the high level changes we wanted to make with items with regards to like making it easier to compare these things.

220
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Codex hits a lot, like a lot of the inventory concerns that we'd have made changes to gems in previous seasons, so we didn't have as many of them clogging up your inventory as well.

221
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:59,000
So we thought that was really, really good stuff. But then we knew that we wanted to make sure that it wasn't just about, like we weren't going to add another tier of iPower to items.

222
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That wasn't the way to make itemization more interesting for players and rewards more interesting.

223
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Now one of the core things that we really want to focus around was the idea that like items have a journey, the best items have a journey, right?

224
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So when you get a really good item, it's about what the potential of that item is, you know, what you can do with this item to make it really superior, right?

225
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, definitely. And that's sort of to jump into tempering.

226
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah.

227
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
One of the first features we had in terms of taking your item on a journey was this idea that we wanted hundreds of different affixes, and each one spoke to the item.

228
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And each one spoke differently to a build. We wanted you to be able to play sort of whatever class fantasy or build fantasy you had in mind and manifest that through customization of your items.

229
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So we actually have some video, I think, of what the tempering feature looks like, and I can talk through some of the updates we've made from the PTR.

230
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So here you have, you know, we're adding an offensive affix to the item. It's going to land on increased corpse explosion damage.

231
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's like, yeah, that's pretty cool, especially if you really like corpse explosion.

232
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We've added a skip button so you can skip through the flow if you really want to blast through this.

233
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We also have a result screen now that shows you exactly what affix it landed on and what the roll range was.

234
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And then we have some more exciting affixes that you're going to see here. For example, chance to cast bone spear projectiles twice, which I know Adam is your favorite.

235
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, yes. I love more projectiles.

236
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I love more projectiles.

237
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't say it like that. Everyone loves projectiles.

238
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's so great.

239
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It is cool, though, to see.

240
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It is pretty cool.

241
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Like, being able to like...

242
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, Derek is here.

243
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So, yeah, we did our swap.

244
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But Joe's still going to be here off screen.

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We just want to make sure that Derek appears here.

246
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Derek is our lead season's designer.

247
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So he'll be talking a little bit more about Helltides later.

248
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Sorry to interject.

249
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

250
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Go ahead, Joe.

251
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So, yeah.

252
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Now I'm off screen.

253
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So, yeah.

254
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think one of the really cool things about the tempering system in general is that like the manuals that we're introducing initially are just like the beginning of what we can do with tempering.

255
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's opportunities to make like really weird and interesting new affixes to kind of throw at the player that we can introduce in seasons or in other updates.

256
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So it's something we can really extend and do some really neat stuff with.

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah.

258
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We absolutely plan to build on it in the future.

259
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

260
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Awesome.

261
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah.

262
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So a bunch of improvements to tempering overall.

263
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah.

264
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And a lot of these, again, these improvements in tempering from the skip animations to the previews and stuff like that that players will see were based off of feedback that we actually got from PTR.

265
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah.

266
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And so, again, huge shout out to the community for providing all that feedback for us so that we can actually get that in before the launch of season four.

267
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

268
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So, but with tempering, we also have master working.

269
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Master working.

270
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yeah.

271
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Which is another new feature within season four and permanently within Diablo 4 itself.

272
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So, talk us through a little bit about what master working is and of course the changes as well that we're going to be seeing based off of PTR feedback.

273
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Sure. Yeah.

274
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So, you know, the next step in your items journey is to really take it to new heights.

275
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You've customized it.

276
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You found some base affixes you're really into.

277
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And we wanted to give you a way to essentially take some of these affixes to new levels.

278
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So, if you think about Helms and CDR or cooldown reduction or for example that chance to replicate, you know, your bone spear, we want you to be able to really juice those stats.

279
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So, I think we have a video here of what that looks like.

280
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You know, overall what we've really done is taken a look at the feedback.

281
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We got a bunch of feedback that it was tedious to upgrade these over and over.

282
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You know, so we've removed the animation from ranks one through three.

283
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We've kept the critical, you know, upgrade.

284
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We have the animation still there, but you can skip it.

285
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You know, again, sort of in the spirit of blasting across everything that we do.

286
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So, we can do that very quickly.

287
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And another piece of feedback that we got was that, you know, part of the master working process allows you to reset this.

288
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And why do you want to reset this?

289
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's because you want to hit that specific affix you're looking for.

290
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You want to juice a specific affix.

291
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And sometimes you might miss, right?

292
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Which means you want to reset that item.

293
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah.

294
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So, part of the resetting sort of requires you to get lower tier materials.

295
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're going to get these from the pit.

296
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
We'll talk about that a little bit later.

297
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But overall, we saw a bunch of feedback that is really tedious to create like a thousand caches and open up them in town like a hundred times.

298
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Right?

299
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's super annoying.

300
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The town is lava.

301
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We want to address that.

302
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Right.

303
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So, you know, we've added multiple scales of material conversion to those caches.

304
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This is a short term solution.

305
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We have something in the future planned.

306
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's just not ready yet.

307
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So, you know, while it's not the perfect solution, it does get you there a little bit quicker.

308
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
There's multiple conversion rates of materials.

309
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So, you can turn, you know, one legendary material into a much higher count of materials based on the tiers that we have in that crafting system.

310
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So, again, not the perfect solution.

311
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
We have something coming in a future update.

312
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Cool.

313
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Awesome.

314
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So, yeah, a lot of changes coming for master working based off of feedback.

315
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Master working, of course, being a brand new kind of that end tale of that item journey that you'll have even after tempering and stuff like that.

316
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So, yeah.

317
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll say another thing that was brought up this field was about Veiled Crystals, right?

318
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Didn't we reduce the amount that you need for crafting?

319
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah.

320
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We did.

321
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We did.

322
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And I can totally talk about some of the stuff we've done just overall on itemization.

323
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Veiled Crystals is one of those things.

324
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah.

325
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So, I'll talk about, first I want to touch on rare and magic items.

326
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That was something we made a change from Season 3 and Season 4.

327
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Legendary items are just generally straight up better than rare items now.

328
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And part of our goal there is really to ensure that players aren't sifting through sand looking through thousands of items.

329
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We want to just call it out, like legendary items are legendary.

330
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
At the same time, we acknowledge that there is some coolness to knowing that certain magic and rare items could have value to you.

331
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We don't have anything for Season 4 yet, but the design team is definitely talking about ways that we can bring this rarity back in a way that doesn't diminish our overall goal of trying to reduce that sort of sifting through sand feeling.

332
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So, in the meantime, you know, they can be salvaged.

333
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
They still have a use in the end game.

334
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But we heard a ton of feedback, to your point, Adam, on the Veiled Crystals.

335
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's just such a bottleneck and it's like, God dammit, I have to pick a bunch of yellow items up to do any of the cool crafting features.

336
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
What the hell, Blizzard?

337
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That's an actual player quote, too.

338
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah.

339
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm very sure it was.

340
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah, so what we've done is we've made it so that Legendaries break down into equal amounts of Veiled Crystals, so you can just not pick up yellow items. It's just a bonus now.

341
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We've also made Sacred and Ancestral items break down into two and three amounts of salvage.

342
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So Sacred items will break down into double, Ancestral will break down into triple.

343
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So we're effectively tripling the output of a lot of the salvage here.

344
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And I know, so one, that was probably the most vocal feedback that we got from players.

345
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Maybe a little bit.

346
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah, like, I need more Veiled Crystals, so I know that there's changes coming for that in Season 4 based off that PTR feedback.

347
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Another, probably maybe the second, maybe also the first, top most, our largest feedback piece that we got is around greater affixes and the visibility related to those.

348
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So there are changes going into that for Season 4. So, Fawn, do you want to talk a little bit about that?

349
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah, we wanted, you know, the dopamine. That was a big goal also of part of itemization is just like seeing an item hit the ground and just be like, oh, I like that jackpot moment.

350
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, that's really important.

351
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So we actually have some video here to show of what that actually looks like on the ground.

352
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So you can see, here's the weirdly long named item.

353
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Repeat to give them.

354
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah, right.

355
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm yielding commander's sacrificial sickle.

356
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I know, right?

357
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So we have one greater affix star. It'll go up to three or four if it's a unique item, which always feels incredible.

359
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So it shows up on the ground when it lands.

360
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And then if we can go to the next video, we actually have an indicator now when it is in the inventory.

361
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, so you can see it.

362
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Zoom.

363
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I asked this as a joke and it looks so good. I'm so happy.

364
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm disappointed. I can't see like the pixels. It's not zoomed in.

365
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So that's been enormously helpful. And really, you know, when you kill like Durial or one of these tormented bosses and they drop a ton of loot on the ground to see some of these have stars on them.

366
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It just is a feel-great moment.

367
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Kind of goes with the whole like not sifting through the sand. You clearly see that icon and you know that it has value to you.

368
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You want to know what's valuable.

369
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Exactly. Especially, again, even on the icon itself, like in your inventory, you'll immediately know those are my greater affix items.

370
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And long gone are the days of the Roman numeral.

371
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
We will.

372
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You don't like the designer solution.

373
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's funny. I think internally we knew like that's probably going to get changed.

374
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
We had a few jokes about that.

375
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Sure.

376
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:57,000
One thing I want to touch on real quick before I move on to itemization if that's okay is we actually, to touch on the Veiled Crystals, I think players are going to want to know this, is we reduced the imprinting cost of Aspects quite a bit.

377
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So that's really going to help the Veiled Crystals as well. I think it went from like 75 Veiled Crystals to imprints on an Ancestral Armor to 16.

378
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah, that's huge.

379
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's a pretty huge swing. You're just getting way more of your Aspects on gear. It's a lot more flexible.

380
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We really want people to feel like, and you know, this is kind of the Codex of Power Updates in general, which I'm really pumped about, is we want you to feel like you're able to re-imprint those Aspects.

381
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yeah.

382
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And that it's something that you're not having a huge cost or huge barriers to doing, right?

383
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah.

384
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because as you upgrade your gear, that should be part of your processes, like putting on their favorite affixes.

385
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah. So a lot of changes coming with tempering, master working, itemization.

386
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And I know, did we have any other changes that you wanted to cover before we move on to the next section?

387
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Colin's got this like, this novel in front of him.

388
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
He's like, what am I going to think she wants to re-imprint?

389
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
He was a keeper of a lot of our changes.

390
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, one I think is worth mentioning, Colin, you may want to talk about is the master working.

391
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Remember we got a lot of feedback about the fail chance?

392
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh, that's a good point.

393
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh yeah, that's true.

394
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
The fail chance.

395
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Funny enough, that was like probably the biggest thing changed.

396
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah, that was the first bullet and I somehow missed it.

397
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah, so we definitely felt like there's a ton of feedback that the double random chance was just a little bit too much.

398
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And we agreed, so we just took it out.

399
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's just fun now.

400
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Just upgrade the item.

401
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
We adjusted the material costs a bit, but the fail chance is no longer there.

402
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah, awesome.

403
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Cool.

404
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, thank you, Colin, for going through those changes.

405
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
We'll actually be back to Colin here later because he still has more to talk about from his novel.

406
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah.

407
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
We have papers that he has.

408
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Joe, you want to swap them out?

409
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
He prepared.

410
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But we did want to jump into some of the class balance changes that are coming after PTR.

411
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Of course with Season 4 we have a lot of class balance changes that are on top of all these itemization changes.

412
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And we got a lot of great feedback from players.

413
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So Mr. Adam Jackson.

414
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You very much did.

415
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah.

416
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Let's run through these.

417
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, so basically...

418
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
The classic Adam Jackson slides.

419
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yes, I love my slides.

420
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We have three categories of things that I'm going to be talking about today.

421
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Again, thanks to everybody for playing on the PTR.

422
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We did get a ton of feedback.

423
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm not going to go over the specifics of everything that changed, but I'm going to go over the categories of things just because there's a whole lot of changes.

424
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
One of the first big ones was end game survivability issues.

425
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So this is kind of talking about those people that went really far into the pit.

426
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And this is kind of something that's been happening online as well that we wanted to address.

427
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And there's this phenomenon when you get really deep into the game and you're fighting high level monsters where, you know, you'll hit a point where the monsters are kind of easy and you're able to blow through with your really powerful builds.

428
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And then you kind of get to a point where they start one shotting you.

429
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And it can be kind of mysterious and hard to understand like what's going on, why did this happen?

430
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We've also had some issues balancing that kind of top end survivability when you get to those hard monsters in the game.

431
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
One of the reasons for this is that variability in player defensiveness has been really high traditionally.

432
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
This is why when you look at the new items in the game in Season 4, you don't see a damage reduction very much at all.

433
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's a very premium stat now that's really hard to get.

434
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And it's to help solve this problem of when someone is stacking all damage reduction versus someone who has none of it, their difference in effective health and survivability is really, really high.

435
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And so it makes it hard to balance the game.

436
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Another part that we wanted to hit was really armor.

437
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That armor is kind of a really confusing stat.

438
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It's not really well understood how it works.

439
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm going to be going over in a little bit how it works and what we're changing to kind of address both of these issues a little bit.

440
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Next is that some stats can get really high.

441
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You know, we added all these crazy awesome stats and we, you know, you can juice them with master working and crit them and all these things.

442
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And it allowed for some really crazy things on the PTR, which people love to post constantly at me.

443
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And we, to be clear, we like crazy things.

444
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You know, it's awesome to get powerful and have that fantasy.

445
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
We do have to take into account things like combat clarity and computer performance to make sure that, you know, the game can still run very well for everybody.

446
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So we made some changes there to adjust that.

447
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You mean it's not fun to just not see the screen or the ground?

448
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I think it is for a little while.

449
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It is hilarious, I think.

450
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah, it's funny for a bit.

451
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But when you can always see like patches of ground.

452
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And one player can do that, let alone when you get four of them in a group.

453
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That's right.

454
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's great.

455
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And last but not least, you know, balance changes and bug fixes.

456
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'll be going over some of them, but there's way more than what I'm covering right now today.

457
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But just know, like, we took a lot of feedback on balance, a lot of feedback on bugs.

458
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
There were a lot of them that were reported and we acted on a lot of them and I'll give an example of some that we did.

459
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
All right.

460
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
So let's go into armor.

461
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So, brief history, lesson, or description of how armor works today.

462
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
This is like when you log in how armor is functioning.

463
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It's your stat for physical damage mitigation.

464
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So you know how you have your elemental resistance that caps at 75 and then can get pushed up a little bit.

465
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Armor reduces your physical resistance up to a cap of 85%.

466
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It can't go higher than that.

467
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That's the number.

468
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But what's confusing is the amount of armor that you need to get to that 85% cap is actually based on the level of the monster that you're fighting.

469
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And I gave some examples here.

470
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
These are the actual numbers in the game.

471
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So if you have a level 50 monster that's hitting you, you know, whacking you, then you need 5,265 armor and then you'll be at that 85% cap.

472
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But then at level 100, at every level of, you know, like 51, 52, 53, that number is going up of what you need.

473
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And at level 100, it's about, you know, 9,230.

474
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And then at level 150 monster, it gets close to 13,000, right?

475
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And so what this ends up, you know, kind of creating is that the player really never knows when they're done with armor, right?

476
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
That number can scale up forever.

477
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's kind of a hidden system under the hood.

478
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So when you're fighting these monsters and they get way higher level than you as you scale into the pit or nightmare dungeons or whatever, you don't really know how much you need.

479
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And so this is kind of really contributing to that phenomenon where, you know, you're fine, you're at the cap, and then you are, you know, the higher level monsters just start one-shotting you.

480
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So in Season 4, a lot of it's going to be the same as Season 3.

481
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It's still going to be your source of physical damage mitigation.

482
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The cap is still going to be 85%, and you're still going to need escalating amounts of armor as the monster level gets higher.

483
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But what we're changing here, if we go forward a little bit, is that armor is now going to cap at that level 100 monster number.

484
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So that 9,230, you can write down this number.

485
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
We're also going to later get into the tooltip.

486
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
We couldn't get it in for the launch of Season 4, but we'll have it soon after.

487
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But it's kind of going to be like Elemental Resistance, where you get to this number, and then you're kind of done with the system, right?

488
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So armor is just another thing on your checkbox of things you want to do as far as defensive survivability.

489
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And once you get it, you're done.

490
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You know, you can get it from gear, legendary aspects, and so on.

491
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Particularly in Season 4, I think this will be a little bit of an easy number to hit.

492
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
We're not trying to make this super difficult or hard to do.

493
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It'll be very achievable for you when you're a level 100 player.

494
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So here we have a zoom in on the tooltip so you can see this player has way above that 9,000 amount of armor that they need.

495
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You know, they have close to 16,000.

496
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But you can see there, you know, that it's capped out at that 85% physical resistance.

497
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And again, soon after the launch of Season 4, we're going to actually put the cap that you need of the number that you're chasing.

498
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Because we want you to know what the goal is that you're trying to hit.

499
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So that means they have a lot of room for optimization, right?

500
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Correct. Yeah.

501
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
This means that this player can actually give up armor on some of their tempering or item affixes and look for other stats.

502
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Like, that's kind of the point.

503
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So next, stat caps.

504
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So, you know, now that we've introduced a lot of ways to get really high amounts of stats in the game, we want to kind of control for visual clarity, you know, what a player can put onto their screen.

505
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So kind of similar to some caps we have already in the game, like attack speed or elemental resistance, we're putting some caps on cooldown reduction and the increased area size.

506
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You know, like, it's really fun to get those giant frost novas that cover the screen, but when it goes like two or three screenings away, it can get really noisy and messy.

507
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So we still want these stats to be really powerful and impactful, but just control a little bit the amount of insanity that they can bring.

508
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And one thing on this cooldown reduction cap, to be clear, this is not just CDR across the entire game. This is just capping what you can get from gear.

509
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So this is like the base cooldown reduction you get when you first cast a skill, what it's going to be.

510
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You can still get cooldown resets or additional cooldown effects from things like the skill tree or legendary powers that just reduce the cooldown of your skills as you do certain mechanics.

511
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
This is just like the baseline cap that comes from your gear.

512
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I think when we looked at the cap for area effect too, we tested it on frost nova and we were like pretty meticulous on what that cap should be and it was still massive.

513
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,000
No, it's huge, yeah. When I say like raking a cap, you're still going to get to insanity when it comes to what's on your screen. It's still going to be awesome.

514
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So you can see here, this is just showing you what the tooltip looks like now. So we're going to be showing you, you know, as a player what those caps are so you know, you know, when you're evaluating your gear on your tooltips, what it is.

515
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And then same thing here, you can see here, like the dust double area effect size bonus, it caps at 100%.

516
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Next, balance updates. So again, like I mentioned before, we made a lot of balance changes based on feedback.

517
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Again, thank you for playing and giving us all that feedback. I'm going to go over some of the things.

518
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
One of the bigger categories of things was again, like I mentioned, those changes due to combat readability and balancing player power.

519
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:15,000
A few examples here of things that we're reducing are like the amount of dust levels that can be on your screen and Fractured Winter Glass, one of my new favorite uniques we're bringing in.

520
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
The amount of frozen orbs that could span the screen is going to be reduced a bit. So I want to prepare you all for that.

521
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Again, to be clear, you're still going to spawn a whole lot. It's just not going to be like insane amounts where you can't see things anymore.

522
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
They're still going to be very powerful. I'm even going to show a video a little bit later of kind of the difference of PTR to what's going to ship in the game.

523
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Some other things that we're doing. Fortify. We wanted to increase the amount of damage reduction that you get.

524
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
This is just Fortify across the board, the base mechanic. That DR is going from 10 to 15%.

525
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And this is because before when it was at 10%, we had to take into account that players could get damage reduction from a million different sources throughout the game.

526
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Now that it's more rare and more premium, we can actually make this mechanic in the game a little bit more impactful and feel like you're a tankier player for opting into these kinds of builds.

527
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
We also made a lot of temporary affix updates. I'm not going to go into detail them.

528
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Just know what you saw in PTR and what's going to ship. You're going to see a lot of improvements, a lot of balance changes, even some shuffling around of the affixes in ways that make more sense based on feedback.

529
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And then we did do some class changes as well. I'm only going to give very few examples here, but just know that there were quite a few.

530
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
One is Druid players. Companion Druid players always harass me. They want that build to work, and I agree. It's really cool.

531
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So we increased the health of Druid wolves by 200%, and we also reduced the respawn rate and cut it in half.

532
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So we got feedback basically that their companions were really good and fun and did damage, but in the late game they just kind of died and couldn't survive.

533
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So we're doing this to kind of address that feedback.

534
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Alright, so here's dust doubles as an example. So you can see on the left, this is just one barbarian by themselves.

535
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The amount of dust doubles that they could produce, right? And then on the right you can see kind of the same barbarian.

536
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You can see like the dust doubles around the areas where the enemies are, they're still getting hit by a ton of them, but it's not covering the entire screen, right?

537
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Especially when you get like three, four, many players together, it really becomes insanity.

538
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah, when you're in a party of four barbs or, you know, it's just like everyone's a barb and I don't know where I'm walking.

539
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah, and other classes do that kind of thing too, not just barb, but this was kind of a good example.

540
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So you know, this is kind of seeing the difference between PTR and live.

541
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And then next we have another class change, so Scoundrels Kiss. This is another one of our new uniques that Rogue players gave us a lot of feedback on.

542
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So a quick summary of how this unique works is it kind of changes your rapid fire skill from shooting straight and hitting a single enemy into kind of a mortar skill where you shoot up into the air and then your arrows fall on the ground and explode.

543
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's really, really cool, but one of the pieces of feedback we got was that when you launched the arrows, they would kind of go in a line and they wouldn't all hit the same enemy anymore.

544
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So if you were trying to do single target damage, it could actually be a nerf unless you like walked right up to the enemies and shotgun them.

545
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And while there was a way to play around it, you know, players weren't really happy that like we transformed the skill so much that it went from a range skill to kind of a melee skill.

546
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So we made an update here and we have a video of the before and after.

547
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,000
But basically you see how the PTR on the left here, how you know, it goes in a big line and then the player has to run right next to the target dummy to do the full damage to it.

548
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And on the right now, you'll see basically you target where those arrows are going to drop and they just all go to that area.

549
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So you can hit a single enemy, but you also hit all the enemies around it because the arrows explode.

550
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So it should be a lot more usable compared to before.

551
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Can Scandals kiss ricochet with my rapid fire?

552
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm pretty sure yes, it can. So it does all the things and inherits all the things that your rapid fire does.

553
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That's very cool.

554
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
But can it double projectile?

555
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm pretty sure it can, just like everything else. Yes. Yes. Spam everywhere. Yes. We love spam.

556
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And last but not least, bug fixes. Like I mentioned before, there were a whole lot of bug fixes reported to us.

557
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Thank you all for getting them. We addressed pretty much every single one that was reported.

558
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm giving some examples here, but again, we got a lot more than what I'm showing on the screen.

559
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
One was Druid's Hurricane was incorrectly scaling damage basically infinitely. So we fixed that.

560
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Ebon Piercer, the extra missiles from our new unique, they incorrectly had 100% lucky hit chance, which is proccing a lot of crazy stuff.

561
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And then Flame Weaver, another one of the new things we introduced to the game.

562
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's basically an effect where you can put a firewall on the ground and then you shoot fire bolts through it and it'll split the fire bolts.

563
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Really cool fantasy.

564
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
But what happened in the PTR was you could stack a bunch of fire bolts right on top of each other and they would split the fire bolts multiplicatively and add more and more, way more than intended.

565
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So you could fire a ridiculous number of fire bolts which were crashing servers and things. So it wasn't great.

566
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
But now we fixed that so it'll work properly.

567
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And again, we're still discovering and working on other fixes. There were a lot more that went in.

568
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
If you reported it, it was very likely fixed.

569
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So basically the build will be in a much better stable state once we launch.

570
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And that's really due to all your feedback. So thanks again.

571
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Awesome.

572
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, that's my section.

573
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
A lot of changes coming to classes. Class balance feedback we got from PTR was really, really great.

574
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah.

575
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:18,000
We were able to make so many different changes there. Of course, some of the biggest ones like the readability stuff that we probably saw,

576
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
seeing the initial videos of the dust devils everywhere was crazy.

577
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Also being in a party with like, I was playing PTR and being in a party with like two barbs and another necromancer.

578
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I was like, oh, okay. Like what's going on, right?

579
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yeah. PTR is, you know, one of those things you get to see things in development state.

580
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I will say these kinds of things are actually pretty common when we're developing anything.

581
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Is being able to create these crazy situations and we, you know, we have to fix it for the game before it goes live.

582
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
So, you know, that's kind of the advantage of PTR is players can find these things, you know.

583
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Exactly.

584
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It's a lot more manpower being put in.

585
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, PTR was super great for us to have.

586
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And, you know, thanks again to the community for the feedback on all the class balance changes.

587
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And thanks Adam for walking us through that.

588
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah.

589
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The next thing we do want to talk about is with Derek over here.

590
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
He is.

591
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Derek is actually going to talk a little bit about, of course, all the immense Helltide changes.

592
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Probably one of the most popular features and changes that we've introduced in Season 4 with PTR and people being able to experience it.

593
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Of course, we got feedback based off of players jumping into Helltide.

594
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And we do want to go through all that with Derek.

595
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And then we also want to talk a little bit about the Season itself with Derek.

596
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So, Derek, you want to jump in?

597
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah, just a few things to cover.

598
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, so as you mentioned, the players who joined us with the PTR or caught all the various, like, blog and video posts and whatnot, know that with Season 4, we're introducing permanent upgrades to the Helltide experience.

599
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Heavy focus on improving and enhancing, I guess, monster density and activity variety.

600
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So there's a ton more things to do in the Helltides, and as a result, there's just a ton more monsters to, you know, mow through in the Helltides.

601
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,000
There's also some explorations, and just to double back real quick, these are all permanent across both the Seasonal and Eternal realms.

602
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So they're not going away once Season 4 ends.

603
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
This is just how Helltide works.

604
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
This is part of the game.

605
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Kind of like our item updates too, right?

606
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Yeah, now and forever.

607
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
This is the new world we live in.

608
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yeah, this is Sanctuary.

609
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
But there's also, if you kind of look at the top right of the screen, there's a threat system.

610
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So the longer you're fighting in the tides, you're going to be accumulating threat, which just results in even more monsters ambushing you at higher frequencies than monster packs.

611
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think the personal favorite, like, fan favorite, is the Hellworm.

612
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You know, this giant demon slug bug that just pops out from the ground and just vomits monsters all over you.

613
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But, you know, kind of with all those, the seasons, as we say a lot, are an amazing opportunity for experimentation.

614
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And sometimes the best results of those experimentations are when they can inspire permanent upgrades and just enhancements to the base game as a whole.

615
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So that's where the Hellborn and the new Accursed Ritual and Blood Maiden come into play as part of the new Helltide experience.

616
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Yeah, look at those. Those look rad.

617
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So the Hellborn, as our Season 2 players might recall, we introduced the Bloodseekers.

618
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And those were really cool monsters based on class archetypes.

619
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So you're kind of like fighting vampiric shadow versions of yourself.

620
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And we take a look at that content and we just love it from like the team perspective and just find like, hey, we're upgrading the Helltides.

621
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
This is a perfect piece of content to just include with it.

622
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So that's where the Hellborn came into play.

623
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You know, they're fallen heroes of Sanctuary.

624
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
They've been overtaken by the corruption from Hell and, you know, kind of turned against you.

625
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Kind of in line with that, the Accursed Ritual and the Blood Maiden.

626
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:53,000
In Season 2 with the Bloodlurs and the Bloodseekers, we introduced this concept of, I guess, calling it just like open world social boss summoning.

627
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
We followed up with like the, yeah, there's a buzzword there.

628
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah, it's very, very catchy.

629
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Rules right out of the tongue. I love it.

630
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Again, to my designer speak sometimes. But yeah.

631
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And we followed that up with like the Malfus spawners in Season 3.

632
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And again, looking at these really successful experimentations from previous seasons, we love opportunities to bring players together and just add that extra layer to the Helltide experience.

633
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So that's where the Accursed Ritual comes into play.

634
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So as you're out fighting against the tides, you'll be collecting the new material, the Baneful Hearts that you can bring to the Accursed Ritual.

635
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It takes three to summon up the Bloodmaiden. And you can do this, you know, by yourself or you can partner up with some buddies and all, I guess, contribute to the summoning together.

636
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And you know, the Bloodmaiden itself is our new Helltide miniboss. She's immensely powerful, but also very, very lucrative.

637
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And I think the last thing I forgot to mention is that this is all expanding into World Tiers 1 and 2 as well.

638
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And kind of like a distilled, not diluted. So there are... the Helltide in World Tiers 1 and 2 is more specifically tuned to, you know, I guess, like meet the leveling needs, or the needs of the leveling player.

639
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Awesome. Oh, on the Bloodmaiden, I remember you had talked about with me before that the people that summon the Bloodmaiden actually get bonus loot drops, right?

640
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah, absolutely. So you can either contribute just by yourself to the Bloodmaiden and get some extra loot for, you know, your troubles.

641
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
We want to, you know, make sure that we give you a little bit extra because you're sacrificing up your hearts.

642
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But also, every player that... it doesn't stack so you're not, you know, stressed to say,

643
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:34,000
hey, I just need to be the one that summons them all. We can all party up and just deposit our own baneful hearts and, I guess, reap the benefits of that.

644
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah. Right. To be clear, so like... so if you put in all three, you get bonus loot, right?

645
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Correct. But like you, me, and Colin are in a group and like I put in two and you put in one, do I get more loot than you?

646
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
No, no. So you get the same amount of loot. So, you know, if Colin has a baneful heart to deposit,

647
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and if we all, you know, dump them in together, then we all get the shared benefits of that.

648
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Got it. But I will touch on a bit later the PTR updates and just some of the enhanced value that the Bloodmaiden received since PTR for both contributors and non-contributors to the summon.

649
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Awesome. Yeah, so a lot of new stuff coming in for Helltide, and this is all part of the stuff that players got to experience in the PTR.

650
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And of course we got learnings from the PTR, as you just mentioned.

651
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Many.

652
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Do you want to walk us through some of the changes that are coming in with Helltide for all the PTR feedback that we had?

653
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yeah, I think I have a PowerPoint on my own.

654
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Ooh.

655
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
There you go. Look at that.

656
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Yeah, so, you know, as mentioned, tons of sweeping changes going into the Helltides and just overall balance of the game in general at Season 3.

657
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And kind of with that, sometimes, you know, we push a little bit too far in some regards.

658
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So we did get feedback and also just own internal kind of field checks on the cinder drop rates were feeling a bit slow in the PTR.

659
00:47:47,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So we just went back, reviewed it and gathered our feedback and just iterated on the drop percentage to hit closer to the expectations of how much we want to be collecting the health, the cinders and interacting with the tortured gifts.

660
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So I think we're in a much better spot. I know we're in a much better spot right now, actually.

661
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So that was one of the first major pieces coming out from the PTR.

662
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
A lot more chess from this, yeah?

663
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Yeah, chess, more loot, more fun.

664
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Awesome.

665
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Let's see the next one. Yeah, so on the topic of more is more fun, the Baneful Hearts.

666
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
We were noticing that they were dropping a bit inconsistently.

667
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So you can get the Baneful Hearts from opening tortured gifts, killing the Hellborn and one of the Doomsayer variants, one of our new activity types.

668
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But again, we want to get the Baneful Hearts in the hands of the players with a pretty steady cadence.

669
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So we noticed with the PTR that we're just not gaining them as frequently as we wanted to.

670
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So we just went back, iterated and kind of reviewed our bad luck protection to just ensure that we improve the consistency that Baneful Hearts are dropping.

671
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And this is all kind of like, the Blood Maiden is not meant to be seen as like this highly ambitious piece of content that you only engage with like once every 50 levels.

672
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We want you getting the Hearts. We want you engaging with the social boss summoning mechanic.

673
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And, you know, I think it just adds that extra layer to the Helltides we want you to engage with.

674
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And on the topic of the Blood Maiden, overall, like we touched on earlier, the Blood Maiden is just saving some overall rewards improvements.

675
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So, as noticed, or as mentioned before, if you contribute to the summon of the Blood Maiden, you receive a bonus reward.

676
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But one of the things was that you couldn't really tell.

677
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:43,000
There is a little icon that appears like when your buff bar, but the effects of that was largely unnoticed from both the team and actually, you know, just the PTR players themselves.

678
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So again, taking this opportunity to just review the overall value of the Blood Maiden for contributors and non-contributors alike.

679
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Because again, we wanted to make sure that she has a clear role in the Helltide experience.

680
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So, again, overall, Blood Maiden is just overall more valuable.

681
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You know, with this we're dropping things like Legendary's Forgotten Sold, Lore Zier mats, and a percent chance for contributors at the end world tiers to, you know, get some end game boss materials as well.

682
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Yeah, so this is now like an additional opportunity for players to get additional of the boss mats for the boss ladders.

683
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah.

684
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah.

685
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Which, you know, we've heard a lot about how players were like, hey, we only really have one kind of method to get them and we wanted to expand that and bring that into more avenues so players didn't have to just kind of be like tunneled off into one area to get like specific boss mats, which is cool.

686
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah.

687
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah.

688
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Variety is the spice of life.

689
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes.

690
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I like that the contribution encourages you to actually use these.

691
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah.

692
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
In season two I'd just chain summon the boss over and over and over and there would be this awkward dance where someone would show up and it's like, I know you have.

693
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah, the waiting game.

694
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Use your material.

695
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Use your material.

696
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yeah, that's why it's really also important that the nuance is not, nuance is honestly lost pretty frequently when we're talking about like drops for different kinds of creatures in different sorts of situations like this.

697
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Like Treasure Goblin, we talked about Treasure Goblin a while ago, a few seasons ago, and I remember I put a poll out on x.com.

698
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That's weird to say.

699
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:20,000
At one point basically asking players what they believed the legendary drop rate of Treasure Goblins to be and I had a whole bunch of options.

700
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I think like 85% of the players were wrong.

701
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And because the drop rate at that time was 50%, players didn't feel it because they didn't see the Treasure Goblin enough to really notice that it was actually that high.

702
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So I think making sure that we were buffing up those moments where if I have my contribution bonus a little bit higher, that helps make sure that that is felt.

703
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, absolutely.

704
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You know what's funny is Joe talking off screen and we're all looking off and people are just staring at us stare into this random corner and stuff.

705
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
You know what would be funny is if we all just actually looked back there at Bale.

706
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
We should have planned that.

707
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Every time.

708
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah, every time.

709
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And like Joe's turned into Bale.

710
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Oh, there it is.

711
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Oh, there it is.

712
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Oh, that's awkward.

713
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
That wasn't part of the plan.

714
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I like the deep shadows of Bale.

715
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I guess the moments when I do decide to say something, maybe they'll occasionally pick up.

716
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Creepy boss.

717
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
We have another camera.

718
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Awesome.

719
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Cool.

720
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So a lot of health tide changes that we have coming into the game.

721
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah, I think there's actually one more slide.

722
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we have one more.

723
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So one thing that we've kind of covered a lot across like just tempering and just the masterwork and just the spirit of Season 4 in general, just like removing friction points and just keeping players in the flow of, you know, the flow of fun.

724
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
People want to blast.

725
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Yeah, absolutely.

726
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
So one of the Doomsayer variants, and again, like the Doomsayer's new activity type, it's kind of like a kinderache surprise where you interact with them.

727
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
They crackle and pop into something, a variety of things actually.

728
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So one of the variants that we had was the chest of Doomsaying where they would explode into a tortured gift that costs 50 cinders and gives you a whole lot of good stuff.

729
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
We're kind of reviewing that and sometimes what could happen is you can encounter one of these at the very start of your helltide running.

730
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You don't have 50 cinders. It's not a lot to get, but it still is kind of a stressful, potentially feels bad moment.

731
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So we just said, hey, let's just have it explode into the loot directly.

732
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You save 50 cinders and you kind of just keep going on your merry way in the tides.

733
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So that's one of the kind of like efficiency smoothing out that we've done.

734
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
The next one is also just we're dumping a whole bunch of monsters on you and it's always a feel bad moment.

735
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
You get knocked out of the interaction. You're trying just to open up a tortured gift and head out.

736
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So we reduced the channel time to open tortured gifts from three seconds to 1.5 seconds, I believe, for season four launch proper.

737
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Nice. That'll help a lot.

738
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
So and I think while I just some feedback, I like, you know, why don't we just make it instant, right?

739
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Right, right. Yeah. You know, we kind of do want to safeguard against like the accidental clicks.

740
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Again, it's a frenetic game, so you're clicking a whole bunch and, you know, I think 1.5 seconds is enough time to, you know,

741
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
let you make sure that that's what you want to commit to before you open it.

742
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And there's also like, because you guys can talk about this, there's changes to like the channeling.

743
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Like you, I think with like dot damage and stuff like that.

744
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Oh yeah, yeah. Dot damage, then we'll interrupt channeling as well.

745
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah. Which is good. So, especially as you are in the frantic areas of Helltide and everything.

746
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So, lots of Helltide changes, a lot of good feedback from players from PTR.

747
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Derek, thanks for walking through on that, but you're not done yet.

748
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But wait, there's more.

749
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah, but wait, there's more.

750
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
As you guys know, like there is, this is season four, Loot Reborn.

751
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And part of Helltide includes the Iron Wolves.

752
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And some people have figured that out even before our blog on Tuesday.

753
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
But we did want to talk a little bit about season four and the Iron Wolves participation in that,

754
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
along with some cool things that are specific to seasonal characters for season four as well.

755
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah, yeah. So, again, as mentioned, the players who joined us in the PTR,

756
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
or again caught all the various blog posts,

757
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
will notice that the Iron Wolves are now a permanent part of the Helltides.

758
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
You know, they're fighting and dying alongside the players now, and they're here to stay.

759
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
However, for our seasonal players, we have the Call of the Wolves seasonal activity,

760
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
where players will get to spend a bit more time with the Iron Wolves,

761
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and go on a bit of a journey with them to try and uncover the potential root cause behind these rising tides,

762
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and uncover this mysterious phenomenon that's threatening to corrupt and consume the Iron Wolves from within.

763
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,000
In addition to that, you know, again, the Iron Wolves are in the Helltides with you.

764
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
As players are fighting and dying alongside the Iron Wolves in the Helltides,

765
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
you're also going to be earning your way through the Wolves' Honor reputation system.

766
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And this is seeing you progress your way through a collection of just super-juiced rewards

767
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:49,000
that are specifically tuned to overpower your leveling journey from level 1 to 100 and beyond.

768
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The main pillar for this reputation track was really pushing the player's powers forward.

769
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The player power forward, there you go.

770
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The player's power forward, and giving them early access to, you know, gear with the juice stats,

771
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,000
legendaries, materials, boss materials, and even a resplendent spark as like a cherry on top at the end.

772
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
We love the juice.

773
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
We do love that.

774
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
But, you know, in the spirit of weight, there's more.

775
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You know, those are all like the gameplay related things,

776
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
but we also have a couple really cool cosmetics that you earn through the collective called the Wolves' Seasonal Activity.

777
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
So, this is the Iron Wolf Mount Trophy, the little Iron Wolf banner.

778
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And, oh, a little bit fast, but yeah, so the Iron Wolf Mount Trophy.

779
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
We're doing it live here.

780
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
That's earned from completing the rep. There it is.

781
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
You can get both of them.

782
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
You can get both of them.

783
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:46,000
That's earned through completing the reputation track, and the Blood Maiden Head is earned by completing the associated Iron Wolf questline.

784
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Awesome. Yeah, those look really great. And of course, as you mentioned, resplendent sparks.

785
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:59,000
There's...and then I know there's one other item that I know we wanted to talk about with this season specific because it is specific for Season 4 and...

786
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks for the reminder on that. There's so much to cover.

787
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I know. Derek has like the largest list of items to kind of go through here, so...

788
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Yeah, so, you know, as mentioned before, on the Seasonal team we love our experiments.

789
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And I don't think a Seasonal would be one without some level of experiments.

790
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So, with that we have the Seasonal item, or as kind of I call it, the Seasonal toy.

791
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And that's the Profane Mind Cage.

792
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah, so there it is.

793
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So, the Profane Mind Cage is pretty cool in the sense that it's a guaranteed drop from the Hellborn.

794
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
And when you consume it, I kind of like to imagine you just like eating this demon brain.

795
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Yum.

796
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:44,000
When you consume it, for the next 60 minutes, the Helltide monsters are going to be boosted up to 10 levels, depending on the world tier that you consumed it in.

797
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And you're also going to be increasing their Aberrant Cinder drop rates.

798
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So, you know, again, all tying this back to that leveling journey and like tempering and stuff, like...

799
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:06,000
This is a really fun item that lets you kind of put your build to a little bit more of a test in exchange for maximizing your Helltide efficiencies through, you know, just one higher monster level.

800
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It means, you know, more XP and stuff like that, and also just Aberrant Cinder drops, too.

801
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Yeah, absolutely.

802
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Oh, go ahead.

803
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I was just going to say, we reduced the world tier 2, 3, and 4 XP.

804
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Oh, that's...

805
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

806
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
It ties super well. You can just get to blast to endgame very quickly now.

807
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yep.

808
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeah, and with the Mind Cage itself, like, you know, because everyone's probably going like, well, that's a consumable, like, how do people end up, like, obtaining additional ones of those?

809
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Or can you get more of those throughout the season and everything?

810
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yeah, we want to be very generous with those.

811
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So, one, they're a guaranteed drop from the Halborn in World Tiers 3 and 4.

812
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But you can also use them in World Tiers 1 and 2, so if you want to, like, boost some level, you know, alts and whatnot.

813
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You also get a, I think, like, a bucket of them through the Wolves Honor reputation.

814
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Like, we crammed as many rewards as we could in there, so they will be in steady stream.

815
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So don't, again, in the spirit of, like, use it, don't hoard it.

816
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Definitely experiment and have fun with this thing, because, you know, it's a game. Have fun.

817
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah, so it's great. Like, if you want a little bit more of a challenge, a little bit better rewards as well, you can, of course, use your Mind Cage.

818
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And that is exclusive for players in the season. So, yeah, it's awesome to see.

819
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But, yeah, thank you, Derek, for walking us through all the changes with Helltide and, of course, some of the new season stuff with the Iron Wolves.

820
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And if you're a lore nerd, Iron Wolves, of course, are a very familiar faction within Diablo.

821
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,000
They are from Diablo 2, Act 3. You could actually hire them as some of your mercenaries.

822
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:39,000
One of the mercenary options, though we know a lot of people went with an Act 2 mercenary in Diablo 2 for the aura.

823
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
But, yes. Cool. Thank you so much, Derek. And, of course, we still have more to talk about.

824
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,000
We're actually going to go back to Colin. And Colin is going to talk us through a little bit about the Pit.

825
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
The Pit is a brand new feature within Season 4 and is now a permanent feature within Diablo 4.

826
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It is. It's right.

827
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And, yeah, do you want to give us a breakdown for people who may have not experienced the Pit or may have not seen the stream beforehand?

828
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And then on top of that, tell us about all the improvements that we're doing to the Pit based off of feedback.

829
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah, so, you know, something that players have asked for since we did a bunch of nerfs to the Nightmare Dungeons.

830
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,000
If you recall, I forget what season it was, but we made Tier 100 Nightmare Dungeons a lot easier so players can get through them.

831
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
One of the big pieces of feedback we got was, okay, well, where's my measuring stick?

832
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
You know, the game is a power fantasy. It's about getting as much raw power as possible and just dominating, right?

833
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So, if there's no place to push back, then, you know, everything is just a little bit too easy.

834
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
So, the Pit of the Artificer is our answer to that measuring stick.

835
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
You're going to be able to push very deep into the Pit. There's a lot of levels.

836
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:52,000
We were inspired by Abattoir of Zier, but to be very clear, you know, Abattoir of Zier was a special case in that each Tier jump was just, like, brutal.

837
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It was, like, exponential.

838
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It was, like, ridiculously hard every single Tier, and it's like, ah, you could only get to 7, which isn't very heroic or powerful, right?

839
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So, we've taken a lot of the learnings from Abattoir of Zier. The Pit goes very deep. There's many more tiers. It's much more gradual, so you can start pushing into it and getting some of these master working material rewards.

840
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And the Pit is all about, you know, just blasting through monsters and the demons of hell, right?

841
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
There's no negative modifiers. We're not CCing you a bunch. You know, this is really just a test of how powerful your build is.

842
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So, from the PTR, we actually got feedback that it was way too easy because we added a ton of power through tempering, through the codex of power.

843
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It's just much easier to get a lot of those aspects online.

844
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
So, we've taken a look and we've moved some of the master working material tiers around.

845
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Previously, you know, the Tier 1 master working materials only came from 1 to 20.

846
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:55,000
We've moved that up 10 tiers. So, Tier 1 will come from 1 to 29. Tier 2 will come from 30 to 59.

847
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And Tier 3 will be 60 plus. And what that does, it just makes the journey feel a little bit more rewarding, right?

848
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Like, we saw in the PTR that people just like within the first two hours just blasted through all of it because they're so powerful.

849
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
So, we've just adjusted some of the rates there. So, you have to push a little bit deeper. You have to optimize your build a little bit more.

850
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:20,000
So, those armor caps are things to watch out for, right? Where if you're over the armor cap, it's just a straight optimization to start thinking about how you want to replace some of that armor.

851
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So, we think that feels pretty good. And overall, we've increased the health and damage, or sorry, I should say, increased the health on all monsters post level 100, both in the Pit and Nightmare Dungeons.

852
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So, the enemy should be pushing back on you a little bit more, right? You care a little bit more about utility, defense, outside of just one-shotting everything, right?

853
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:47,000
So, it sort of tests you a lot more. You know, and part of that feedback, though, that we've heard is that, well, like, Nightmare Dungeons don't feel very rewarding.

854
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
The Pit doesn't feel super rewarding post, you know, that 60 tier when you're getting those master working, top-end master working materials.

855
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So, we've done two major changes. One is we've added obols that scale with both of these tiers.

856
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So, everything past tier 46 in Nightmare Dungeons and everything past tier 1 in the Pit, actually. It just always gives you obols.

857
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You might ask, like, but obols are terrible. But, you know, again...

858
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Why do I want obols, Colin? I know, right? A big part of Season 4 was that, you know, we made the Gambler guarantee 925 Legendaries at level 100.

859
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And those Legendaries can roll greater affixes. So, you know, if you blow, you know, a ton of obols on two-handers, for example,

860
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,000
those two-handed Legendaries you're getting are the same as anywhere else in the game. So, it's actually a huge efficiency boost to getting the items you're looking for.

861
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
So, to be clear, you can get, like, some of the best items in the game from the obol vendor now.

862
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Absolutely.

863
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Nice.

864
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
That makes it a little long.

865
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And one thing that is also changing with obols is, like, because, you know, when people pick up obols, they're like,

866
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Oh, I've got my cap. And now I'm like, Oh my god, run back down.

867
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
But, Colin, the obol cap is f**k. So, you know, like, we've increased the obol cap substantially.

868
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
So, the amount of obols you get now is 2,500 you can hold up to.

869
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Oh, yeah.

870
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So, you can just, like, go to the Gambler and be like, give me everything. And you can just do that a couple of times.

871
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
So, get your obols and hit the tables. Yeah, exactly. And the items are incredible.

872
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And just to, like, double down on this for a second, too, like, one of the things that we also did as part of this, like, when you use the enchanting feature in Diablo 4, you can't actually enchant off of an affix into a greater affix.

873
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
That's right. Yes.

874
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So, when a good item drops for you in the base game, you can't try to, like, roll for greater affixes off the enchanting system.

875
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Yeah.

876
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
It's good for getting you to a stat you really need in a situation where an item didn't get you what you wanted.

877
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah.

878
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,000
But now with the obols vendor, like, those items, not only are they iPower 925, and they have the chance to be legendary, of course, like the obols vendor always has,

879
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
but you also have a chance to get greater affixes off those gambled items.

880
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
That's right. Yeah.

881
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:53,000
So, again, if you're looking for a particular pair of gloves, you're looking for a particular helmet, and you're saying, I really want a greater affix version of cooldown reduction on my helmet.

882
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
That's right.

883
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Right? Like, now it's like, okay, cool, I'm gonna take my 2,000 obols, I'm gonna go to the vendor, I'm just gonna just gamble, gamble, gamble, gamble, and try to get that one helmet.

884
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yeah.

885
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Like, now I have a chance to really do that. And this is a way for you to, like, getting more drops and such inside the pit is one thing, but giving you more choice when you get out of a pit run, I think, very, very valuable.

886
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
It's gonna feel way better, yeah.

887
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Absolutely.

888
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yeah, and another change we made was to Glyph XP. We got a bunch of feedbacks.

889
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It's like, yeah, what the hell, Nightmare Dungeon. So we've increased the Glyph XP by 25%, which is faster leveling.

890
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
We've also scaled the amount of Rune Shards, which is the pit currency, to get into the pit, with Nightmare Dungeon.

891
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,000
So you can create sort of a positive feedback loop if you're really strong, you're really powerful, you're hitting those tier 100s,

892
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:46,000
and the Nightmare Dungeons, you're getting tons of pit keys that you can then translate into the pit, and just get lots of runs and lots of master working there.

893
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah, so, a lot of feedback from Nightmare Dungeons. People were saying, like, hey, are we planning on making any changes to that Glyph XP?

894
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Yeah.

895
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
So there are some...

896
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
We sure did.

897
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:09,000
We sure did. We actioned on it, for sure. So, and there's, funny enough, there's also even in the Season Journey, I believe, there's also, like, changes to the hashes themselves,

898
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:16,000
where you can actually use that to boost even, like, Glyph XP is also part of that with the Season Journey. So, very cool stuff that we have.

899
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Oh, one more. Sorry. I have this list, but then I don't actually read it. It's just, like, a prop. Yeah, sorry.

900
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
One other thing that we did was, we heard a bunch of feedback that players were dying at the end of the pit,

901
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
because we have this, like, shadow boss that sometimes comes in and throws a wrench in what you're doing.

902
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,000
And, you know, as much as I push for learn to play, you know, our encounter designers...

903
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I like to think that good philosophy person.

904
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Ruthless.

905
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Absolutely.

906
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Take that hardcore players.

907
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Yeah.

908
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Surprise.

909
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah.

910
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Isn't it fun to die after you killed the boss?

911
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah. So, our encounter designer did an amazing job cleaning up a lot of those affixes after you killed that boss,

912
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
and the arena should be clear now after you killed that boss.

913
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
As chat says, get good.

914
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:07,000
But, yeah, we saw that a lot, and, you know, if you're a hardcore player, that would have been a tragic loss to your character.

915
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I prefer the word hilarious.

916
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Yeah, some designers, like, fist pumping, like, yes!

917
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Got him!

918
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Yeah, just watching streams and reactions from that.

919
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
So, awesome.

920
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
So, a lot of changes coming for the pit.

921
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Pit is, of course, a new feature within Diablo 4 permanently, and you can experience that in Eternal and Seasonal Realms.

922
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And, of course, we have some updates to the boss ladder, because the boss ladder itself is changing pretty significantly.

923
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
We talked a little bit about, like, how you can get additional materials in other places that Derek had mentioned,

924
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:47,000
but Colin has additional, like, points that he wants to bring up about the boss ladder, because we got a lot of feedback on that,

925
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
and there's some new changes to it with Season 4.

926
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
That's right.

927
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Yeah, so we added Endariel, the best lesser evil.

928
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Yes!

929
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Boo, Asmodan!

930
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Yeah, I know.

931
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Yeah.

932
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Always dunking me.

933
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Yeah, always dunking me with orbs all day.

934
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Who likes that guy?

935
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Yeah.

936
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So, Endariel, obviously, has come back.

937
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
She's incredibly fun to fight.

938
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
The Encounter Design team killed it.

939
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And, you know, on top of Endariel, we've added a new tier to the boss ladder called Tormented Bosses.

940
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
So these are much higher level than level 200 bosses, sort of pinnacle aspirational bosses to take down.

941
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
And what we've done here is we heard a bunch of feedback that it required five times the amount of boss materials,

942
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
including some rare pit material to summon these, and five times the reward.

943
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,000
That didn't really feel like the right amount of reward efficiency for taking on something that was challenging,

944
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
so we've nerfed the cost.

945
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,000
It's now 3x the amount of boss material and 5x the reward, so you can get some pretty big efficiency wins there,

946
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
especially if you're crushing them in the endgame.

947
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
So that's feeling pretty good, we think.

948
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,000
We also heard a lot of feedback that it's tedious to do the same activity over and over and over to summon some of these things, right?

949
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
So it's like, I want to summon Penitent Knight, or I want to do the Beast and Ice.

950
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I know you and I have done that one hundreds of times.

951
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Yeah, every build I've chosen in a season requires the Beast and Ice, and I'm just stuck in Nightmare Dungeon forever.

952
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
It's been great.

953
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

954
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Very happy about that.

955
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Yeah, well, we made it better.

956
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
A lot of our random monsters and activities and things like that,

957
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
so elites, Whisper Caches, Treasure Goblins, World Bosses, Hellborn to name a few,

958
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
are all going to start randomly dropping these boss materials.

959
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
So you're not necessarily forced into doing one exact activity.

960
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
It's still going to be the absolute best way to get some of this boss material,

961
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
but as long as you're blasting, you're just going to be getting a lot of these materials ambiently,

962
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
which you can trade, you can just sort of cash in on your heart's desire.

963
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I mean, we think this makes the game feel more flexible and just sort of enables you to play a little bit more on how you want to play,

964
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
while still keeping the experience fresh.

965
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So we think that's going to be a pretty big win.

966
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Yeah, it's huge.

967
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Yeah.

968
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
To jump back into the Torment bosses, just because I'm going to jump around a little bit,

969
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
we heard a bunch of feedback, especially from Woodyjoe, hopefully he's watching.

970
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
There's no way Woodyjoe's watching right now.

971
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I know, probably not.

972
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Yeah, it's not very interesting.

973
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
We did some tuning to make sure that the Torment and versions have some more parody, right?

974
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It was sort of like in a scenario where one of the latter bosses was just like dead easy,

975
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
didn't really match the difficulty of the rest,

976
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and that's important because we give you one guaranteed Resplendent Spark one time for defeating any of these.

977
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
So one step closer to getting that Uber unique that's not just a raw drop of your choice,

978
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
which is pretty awesome.

979
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And then something else, you know, speaking of Resplendent Sparks, we're adding one to Uber Lilith.

980
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So the first time you kill Uber Lilith, you're also going to get another Resplendent Spark.

981
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Now, that brings us to three opportunities of being able to earn yourself a Resplendent Spark.

982
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
That's right.

983
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,000
We heard one from Derek at the end of the season, the Iron Wolves, you know, board,

984
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
and doing that within the season.

985
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
We now have one with the Echo of Lilith, and of course one with your first Tormented boss as well.

986
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:09,000
So additional opportunities to earn Resplendent Sparks, and of course you can still salvage any Uber gear that you do happen to find,

987
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
and you can actually earn a Resplendent Spark.

988
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So what that means is if you do all of these and then you get an Uber unique,

989
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
you can actually change that into whatever one you want.

990
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Yes.

991
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
That's really what that means.

992
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And then something else, you know, on the Uber uniques is that...

993
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I'm just laughing because I didn't realize this, but chat's calling out.

994
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
With our tool tip that we showed, we had 200 plus Resplendent Spark.

995
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
That's what happens when you work in it.

996
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
We're just really lucky.

997
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
We're doing good.

998
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Yeah.

999
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
That's how I get them.

1000
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Let me tell you guys about DevTools.

1001
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1002
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
That's actually my account online.

1003
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1004
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Nice.

1005
01:11:48,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So on the Uber uniques, you know, we heard a bunch of feedback that it feels like a chore to have to do, you know, the Pendant at night into Varshan, into doing Durial just for a chance at an Uber unique, right?

1006
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And, you know, we've experienced that ourselves, right?

1007
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It's like, God, I got to do all this stuff to fight the boss that's going to actually drop something that I care about.

1008
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
You know, Greater Affix has helped that because, you know, there's some variation to the uniques you're going to get.

1009
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:22,000
But for Uber uniques, we've actually added a small chance, a little bit lower than Durial, to all of the ladder bosses, and they're going to have a chance to drop an Uber unique as well.

1010
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
So, you know, while you're grinding through this ladder, every single boss you kill is going to have a chance to drop an Uber unique.

1011
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It's not exactly the same as Durial and Durial.

1012
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
We should do a combo.

1013
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
A lot of URLs.

1014
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
And we think that's going to make it feel a lot better.

1015
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Awesome.

1016
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So, yeah, a lot of changes coming with the boss ladder and changes based off of PTR feedback that we saw.

1017
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Plus just overall changes for Season 4 that we were planning so that it gives more opportunities for players to actually experience it.

1018
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Of course, the new versions of the bosses themselves and their tormented Echo versions.

1019
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
So, awesome.

1020
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Thank you so much, Colin.

1021
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Of course.

1022
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:11,000
And I know we wanted to, before we jump into Q&A because we're getting towards the end of our updates for Season 4, Mr. Adam Jackson wants to talk a little bit about the Season Journey.

1023
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Yeah.

1024
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
This is actually something really cool.

1025
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
One last thing.

1026
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Us over on Class Designer, we're really passionate about this and we're excited for it.

1027
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So, the Season Journey.

1028
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
So, we really want to kind of juice the rewards and make the Season Journey more exciting.

1029
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:36,000
And so, what we went and did was when you're going through the Season Journey for every class, you're actually going to be getting a preset curated amount of Legendaries as you're going through that are targeted toward a specific build.

1030
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
So, we chose a build for every class in Season 4 and we're going to change it around in future seasons.

1031
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Please give us feedback on this, but we think it'll be pretty cool.

1032
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,000
But you're basically going to get close to a completed build when it comes to opening those caches.

1033
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
So, guaranteed targeted Legendaries to build a specific fantasy for every class.

1034
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I think we have a video to show what they're going to be for every class in Season 4.

1035
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Maybe.

1036
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Maybe there.

1037
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:05,000
So, Barbarian here, you can see we're going to be giving you a bunch of Legendaries related to Dust Doubles.

1038
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
The Druid, we're going to be giving you basically a Pulverized build, which is pretty cool.

1039
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Next is the Necromancer.

1040
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Of course, everybody's going to be playing Minions, so we gave you a bunch of Minion-focused Legendaries.

1041
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
This should be pretty awesome.

1042
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And then next is the Sorceress.

1043
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
We actually have a cool new Legendary coming into the game for Incinerate, which you'll see here.

1044
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Oh, yeah, there it is.

1045
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It splits up.

1046
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So, we're giving you an Incinerate build on the Sorceress.

1047
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And then the Rogue, we're giving you one targeted toward Barrage.

1048
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
So, again, kind of the point of this is that, you know, if you don't really know what you want to play,

1049
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
or you really want to just go through a Season Journey and try out something before you go to a build that you really want to do,

1050
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
you have a foundation of something more complete to start with, which we're pretty excited about.

1051
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yeah, and with the Codex change now, you also get to kill all those items that are actually dropping out of the Season Journey caches.

1052
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
You get to kind of keep those. They're all going to your Codex.

1053
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
You use that build for the entire leveling process.

1054
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Correct.

1055
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Yeah.

1056
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Awesome. So, lots of changes coming in the Season...

1057
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Sorry, my mic died halfway through there.

1058
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So, I had to do a quick mic swap as we were playing footage.

1059
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
We were free from it.

1060
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Also, Joe Piper is back.

1061
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Hi, Joe. Derek is now over here.

1062
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So, if people are confused of what's going on.

1063
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
We are playing Musical Chairs today.

1064
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
That is also a new feature coming in Season 4.

1065
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Our favorite team.

1066
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I'm just kidding.

1067
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But, yeah. So, a lot of changes. Season 4, pretty huge.

1068
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's by far the biggest season for Diablo 4 yet.

1069
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And I know we wanted to jump into Q&A.

1070
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I did want to bring up one thing as well.

1071
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Oh, wow. Okay.

1072
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Which is, this is a change that will be represented in...

1073
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
By the way, patch notes are coming out immediately after this stream.

1074
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Oh, geez. Okay.

1075
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
So, that's one thing.

1076
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
So, yeah.

1077
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
People can check out patch notes immediately after this stream.

1078
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Please enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed writing it.

1079
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Writing it and reviewing it and editing it.

1080
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And I wouldn't...

1081
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Based off of the size of the patch notes, I wouldn't be surprised if we do have a few things that might be missing.

1082
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
That we'll probably have to post-add as we're kind of going through it.

1083
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Just because it's massive in terms of size as people saw from PTR.

1084
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And now it's just even...

1085
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It represents a few different teams like EFRA trying to do this too.

1086
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Yeah.

1087
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
So, but patch notes will be up.

1088
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
One thing in the patch notes that I did want to bring up is...

1089
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And this is a thing that's coming in Season 4 is...

1090
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
For players that want to change their hair on their characters themselves.

1091
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
They can actually go to the wardrobe now and actually be able to do it.

1092
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Which is a nice, good quality of life feature.

1093
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
We've heard a lot of people go like,

1094
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Hey, I kind of want to...

1095
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
You know, I made that character a while ago.

1096
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Especially like an internal character or something like that.

1097
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I'd like to be able to change that around.

1098
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yeah, now I have that flexibility of being able to do so.

1099
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Cool. Which is actually really cool.

1100
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So, we're going to jump into Q&A as usual.

1101
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
As we always do.

1102
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yeah.

1103
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
We will start off with a question.

1104
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
This is actually something that's been a popular topic that a lot of people have been talking about.

1105
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Since PTR and of course even this week with the blog itself.

1106
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
But...

1107
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
It only means suspense.

1108
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I know.

1109
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I think we have the question. There it is.

1110
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
What does this mean for Season Powers in the future?

1111
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Oh, just what Season 4 is?

1112
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Like the nature of Season 4?

1113
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Yeah. Okay, sure.

1114
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
So, yeah. Season 4 is a...

1115
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Season 4, as I mentioned before, is an opportunity for us to lift up a lot of aspects of the game that we think are really important.

1116
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Diablo is a game about killing monsters and getting loot.

1117
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And as I said before, getting loot, we need to make sure it feels at least as good as killing monsters.

1118
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Right?

1119
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah.

1120
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's extremely important that this part feels good.

1121
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And we took a lot of our development effort and put it against that goal as part of this release.

1122
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
And there were other parts of the game that we lifted up at the same time.

1123
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Like the various changes that we talked about for Helltide, for example.

1124
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
You know, the myriad new tempering recipes and things like that.

1125
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
There's lots of things we did, I think, as part of the release.

1126
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Just make the base experience of Diablo 4 more fun.

1127
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Right?

1128
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
So, I'm really excited we were able to do that in Season 4.

1129
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Thinking about what the future holds, we always want to make sure that with every season,

1130
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
you know, we are adapting to what we think the game needs at that time.

1131
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
We think it's going to make for a better experience overall.

1132
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We love the idea of Seasonal Powers.

1133
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,000
We've learned a lot of really, really great stuff from the days of the Barber,

1134
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
all the way through the Vampiric Powers we got in Season 2,

1135
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
and all the Seneschal and Construct stuff we had in Season 3.

1136
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
We have lots of big ideas for the future.

1137
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
But, you know, you will see Seasonal Powers again in the future

1138
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
and different themes and mechanics as we go.

1139
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
That's, you know, that's kind of our promise to you.

1140
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
And with the things that we have in terms of like the Iron Wall's quest line

1141
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
and the various rewards you get, changes we made to the Seed and Journey

1142
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
for like getting all of those themed items, those various kind of aspect builds together

1143
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
as you kind of progress through, we want to keep building upon these mechanical elements

1144
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
as well at the same time.

1145
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
They can continue to help lift up the experience.

1146
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So yeah, we will be returning to Seasonal Powers in the future.

1147
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
You know, but with every season, we want to make sure that we're doing what we're doing

1148
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
what we think is lifting the game up the most, the things that we think are most important at that time.

1149
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Awesome.

1150
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Question from our, I'll bounce between some questions from chat and from our forums

1151
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
because we did have a thread up in our forums about specific questions.

1152
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Sure.

1153
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
This one's from the forums, this is from Avalon.

1154
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
They're asking if, because you know, Season 3 actually ran longer and Season 4 itself had a PTR,

1155
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
will Season 4 actually be a shortened season or will it still be a standard size season?

1156
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
They weren't sure how PTR is actually affecting the time on it.

1157
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So PTR is not as impactful for the timing here.

1158
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
We, we, we, I think it's a slightly shorter season.

1159
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I think it's like, like one week shorter or something.

1160
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I need to look at the date.

1161
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yeah.

1162
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And, and I will note like PTR, the, the reason why Season 3 ran longer was because we wanted to make sure that we could get that PTR.

1163
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
This was our first PTR.

1164
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
So, you know, there was, there was a little bit more effort into, needed to get that out for players.

1165
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Yeah. I guess you, I guess you, you're absolutely right.

1166
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
So like, I think about like, when I'm thinking about the future and like what PTRs look like,

1167
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
what we want things to be like, we're, it's not that like having a PTR automatically means that everything is,

1168
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
is going to take longer to deliver.

1169
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
It's, but there was a lot of things we had to set up for the first time for the PTR for Season 4.

1170
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And I'm really glad that we did because it's, as I think you've seen, there's a lot of things we learned going through the process.

1171
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And it gave us the time to iterate and use the feedback too.

1172
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Yeah.

1173
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
A lot of things on, based on.

1174
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yeah.

1175
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
A question from BlakeDarkGoCS.

1176
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Will you guys think about maybe a potential different beam color for items with greater affixes?

1177
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
So I know we talked about this for a while.

1178
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yeah.

1179
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Yeah.

1180
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I think that's something we're definitely going to keep an eye on.

1181
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Like right now we think that the little dots or the, I should say huge dots, the huge stars on them,

1182
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
are doing a pretty good job.

1183
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But you know, that's something that we also need to feel out and play.

1184
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And we're super open to feedback and seeing how these new big stars are going to help.

1185
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Yeah.

1186
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Yeah.

1187
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Yeah.

1188
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
The change, especially the changes in the inventory because like now you can actually identify them in your inventory and everything is really big.

1189
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And these also roll on Unique.

1190
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
So there's a little bit of like work that we'll need to figure out.

1191
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But again, it's just for you.

1192
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Yeah, it's true.

1193
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Yeah.

1194
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
You can get greater affix on Unique as well.

1195
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Yeah.

1196
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
So it's like what, yeah, the beam color gets a little confusing there.

1197
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
So something that we'll monitor for sure.

1198
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It's a good idea.

1199
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And of course something that we've seen from players and a lot of people bringing that specifically up.

1200
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Fire Dragon Dad says that the Season 4 update is going to retro into existing Eternal.

1201
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:14,000
So, see, everything we talked about today with the exception of the Iron Wolves questline stuff is actually present in the Eternal realm.

1202
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
So, players like the Codex of Power changes, everything like that will be there.

1203
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I know there are a lot of questions related to like the Codex changes, especially for Eternal players.

1204
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And just to clarify, if you have aspects in your inventory and your stash, you'll take whatever your highest roll of that specific aspect.

1205
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And that will become your new best Codex entry when Season 4 does start.

1206
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:44,000
You may need to log on to specific characters on Eternal to at least like for us to be able to check your inventory.

1207
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
But the stash I know will automatically move over there.

1208
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
That's cool.

1209
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And same thing for, I know we get a lot of questions about like items on Eternal.

1210
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Those will be marked as like legacy items specifically because obviously we've changed a lot of aspects of everything.

1211
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And those items, you can't craft on those items either at that point.

1212
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
No.

1213
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Like you can't temper those items and you can't masterwork those items.

1214
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
But they'll still retain like the item upgrade state that they had from the Blacksmith Book Park.

1215
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Exactly.

1216
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So, it doesn't mean like when you log on all your gear is suddenly unusable.

1217
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
It's just marked as legacy and you won't be able to use tempering or masterwork.

1218
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It's a great stepping off point to getting some new items that could have greater affixes and other things that could make you even more powerful.

1219
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Yeah.

1220
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Yeah.

1221
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
A question that we have actually from the forums.

1222
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
This is from Iggy.

1223
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:36,000
With the itemization reworked, is there, what is like the next like big thing you guys are actually looking at potentially wanting to really work on within the team?

1224
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I don't know if we want to play our cards too early on.

1225
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Yeah.

1226
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Well, I think it's...

1227
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
We're working on things.

1228
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
We're working on all kinds of stuff everybody.

1229
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:53,000
But no, I think one thing we want to continue to work on, I think you see like, as we're thinking more about the end game experience, a lot like when we launched Diablo 4 we thought of end game really as a journey.

1230
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:03,000
From like, really from 50 to 100, like the things you were doing along the way and getting all of your preparing on glyphs and leveling those glyphs up and go diving deeper into nightmare dungeons and, you know, going and eventually confronting Lowe.

1231
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
So that was what we kind of imagined or thought that end game would feel like and that was a good thing for us to build on.

1232
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I think we saw that a lot more players were looking for end game like explicitly at level 100.

1233
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
That was when they wanted a lot more things to open up.

1234
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And we've made a lot of changes recently to try to like create more gameplay around that part of the experience between like the itemization changes and the crafting changes and also the introduction of like tormented bosses and of course the Paveo Artificer.

1235
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Yeah.

1236
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So I think that like we know that there's more opportunities for us to build on these things, right?

1237
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I think you've heard me say this before but, you know, a lot of things we're doing in season 4 specifically really are done to like build a new framework, you know, for how end game sort of functions.

1238
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:45,000
The things that drive a player forward, the things that get them excited, and the content that they engage with along the way as well, right?

1239
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:54,000
We want to make sure that players are having a really fun time or rewarding time while they're playing Diablo 4 and they can find opportunities to be appropriately challenged as they go through the experience as well.

1240
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:03,000
We think there's more opportunities for us to kind of like grow and expand the offerings of things that players have access to, the things they can go experience, you know, at that stage of the game.

1241
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Awesome.

1242
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Question from Old Dudes New Games.

1243
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I love these names. They're so good.

1244
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
What about codex resetting when swapping characters?

1245
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
That was actually just an issue on PTR.

1246
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Like when you swapped characters and stuff like that. Sorry.

1247
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Yeah, when you swapped and you used the boost NPC.

1248
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Yeah.

1249
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
So that was not a thing that you will experience with season 4.

1250
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
And so that's not a common thing or a normal thing that's supposed to actually happen.

1251
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
It just was a bug that we had in PTR.

1252
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:43,000
There's a lot of questions here about the mine cage and I just want to maybe clarify with the players.

1253
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Opus Crocus says, if you consume more than one, does the mine cage stack or does the timer reset?

1254
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Timer reset, I think.

1255
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yeah, the timer resets.

1256
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Timer resets.

1257
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Okay.

1258
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
And then in regards to, again, this is from Optix.

1259
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Do mine cages trigger for a single player or your whole group if you're grouped up?

1260
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Single player.

1261
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Just a single player.

1262
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Yeah, it's a personal thing.

1263
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Okay.

1264
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Alright, so clarity around the mine cage.

1265
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Yeah.

1266
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Because I know we've had a lot of people ask specifically about that.

1267
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And we want feedback on this, by the way, too.

1268
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So when you get a chance to play with the mine cage during the season, like, you know, tell us what you think.

1269
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
We want to know.

1270
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
This is from Noopu Games.

1271
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Do unique items get a stat slash functionality boost since tempered legendaries are just straight up better?

1272
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And is it generally not worth it to equip a unique item after the patch?

1273
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Yeah.

1274
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I mean, I think Adam can speak to some of these changes if you wanted to jump in.

1275
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
But we've done a pass on all the unique items.

1276
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,000
We've done things like Razor Plate, I think, has four Thorns affixes and we changed what the legendary power is.

1277
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,000
By the way, that was a big question we got from people at the PTR because they were like, hey, what about Razor Plate?

1278
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
What about Razor Plate?

1279
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
We heard a lot.

1280
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
We had to change Razor Plate.

1281
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
It'll be cool.

1282
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
It'll be cool.

1283
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And it's actually in the patch notes.

1284
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
And yeah, it's a lot of Thorns.

1285
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Razor Plate's hilarious.

1286
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
We still love it.

1287
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
It's hilarious.

1288
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I wanted to just have like one so you can't miss on Masterwork.

1289
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Yeah.

1290
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
But that might be too crazy.

1291
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Yeah, what I'll say though about the unique to legendary item power level, I suppose, is that we knew when we were making these temporary changes and updating those that we wanted legendaries because they kind of have a...

1292
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Like, they have kind of different identities right now in the game.

1293
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
And so we're still figuring out what we want to do with uniques long term.

1294
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:36,000
But the idea is that like legendary items or items really, they have a journey and you know, you're working on them and there's a story to them and you know, you get it and it's not like a one stop shop.

1295
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
You're done.

1296
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Kind of like how they were before.

1297
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Uniques, a part of our identity is that, that like, you know, you get a unique and it's freaking awesome and really powerful and very exciting and you have it and you're done with it.

1298
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:52,000
And so we're keeping this discrepancy of like what their purposes are in the game for now and kind of seeing how it goes.

1299
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:59,000
We did take a look at some uniques but we didn't like do a whole pass of like, you know, every single unique now has five outfixes or something like that.

1300
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Like we wanted them to be a little bit different in different identities.

1301
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
So we do kind of expect that uniques may be less prevalent than they were before.

1302
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:12,000
We still believe though that a lot of uniques are really key for various builds and so you're still going to want them.

1303
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But you're not going to want like a unique in every single slot in your character now because it is clearly always better, right?

1304
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Sometimes some builds will want more uniques, some will want less and we want to kind of see how that plays first before making sweeping changes.

1305
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
You know, some obvious roads we could take is like adding crafting to uniques.

1306
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
What if you could temper them?

1307
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
What if you can do these other things, right?

1308
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Like we know that that's a thing and we may do that in the future, but we're kind of evaluating this world where it's not clearly always you only get one or the other.

1309
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And we kind of want to see how that goes first before making any big changes.

1310
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Yeah.

1311
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And the fixed nature sort of has you consider it's part of your optimization puzzle.

1312
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Yes.

1313
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Like, well, I'm going to give up some tempering affixes to get this unique, for example, in my chess slot, for example.

1314
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
And we sort of want to see where that goes.

1315
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Like we think that that's fun.

1316
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,000
And we think that the excitement of a unique are those fixed stats.

1317
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
When you see the item on the ground, you know like, oh, okay, that's the unique I want.

1318
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I can just equip it.

1319
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I don't even have to work on it.

1320
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Yeah.

1321
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
It's just like there for me.

1322
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
So.

1323
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Awesome.

1324
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And then I know, by the way, did we talk about master working?

1325
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Or not master working, but.

1326
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
We did talk about master working.

1327
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
We did talk about master working.

1328
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
We did talk about master.

1329
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
We've done it twice on Supernatural.

1330
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Did we talk about groups and with the pit?

1331
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I didn't write it down and I didn't talk about it.

1332
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Yeah.

1333
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Yeah, so we got a bunch of feedback that, you know, it sucks to help someone with their pit run and just not get any master working material.

1334
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It's like, well, why am I here?

1335
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:46,000
So what we've done is we've made it so that the person who opens the pit is going to get 100% of the master working materials.

1336
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Previously, I think it was split maybe across all players.

1337
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And what we've done now is that the person who opens it gets 100% and then everyone who helps defeat the pit gets 50% of that target goal.

1338
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:05,000
So we're trying to walk that line where group play isn't just like totally overwhelmingly efficient, but you're still getting something for helping each other go through those pit levels.

1339
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Yeah, we heard a lot of feedback about players going like, ah, it feels a little unrewarding to it.

1340
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Yeah, totally.

1341
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
There were some changes from the future.

1342
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:19,000
In general, I think there's still some tension with how players feel about the efficiency of groups versus the efficiency of solo play with like boss summons and things like that.

1343
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
These are things we're thinking about, we have ideas on, but we want to continue to get feedback, particularly with these changes, and kind of see how things play out.

1344
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Absolutely. Awesome.

1345
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:34,000
We're getting questions about, you know, hey, are there any updates on social features and things like that coming to D4?

1346
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Don't know if we have anything to share right now.

1347
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:44,000
It's something obviously that team is very well, you guys ask all the time, and we're very, very aware of it.

1348
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And the team has been looking at it, and once we have more to share, we'll end up sharing it with you guys.

1349
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
But for right now, we don't have any update.

1350
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:04,000
There's questions about if there's plans of adding maybe potential leaderboards to the pit or anything, or is that going to be something that's just exclusively on the gauntlet?

1351
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I think the idea of adding leaderboards to other types of content over time makes sense, could be pretty fun.

1352
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:19,000
But right now, we really want to see how the pit plays on its own. The trials feature on Challenger's Ladder, we really want that to be a place where players can, or the gauntlet,

1353
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:27,000
it's a place where we really want players to be able to go and compete in a very fixed environment, in a very extremely fair environment, which is what we really prioritize as part of the release.

1354
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:33,000
The pit is pretty variable, run to run, so that makes it a little more complicated. It doesn't mean that we would never add it.

1355
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I think that there's a clear indicator that it would be pretty fun to have this slightly looser leaderboard associated with a feature like this.

1356
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
But we're going to see how things play out, and we'll be thinking about how we can add more competitive features like that to the game over time.

1357
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Question from Elrohir, I didn't pronounce that right, but...

1358
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
No, Elrohir, I think that is actually.

1359
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Nailed it.

1360
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It's like an Elven game right now.

1361
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Since not everyone actually experienced PTR, because PTR itself was on PC Battle.net, but they were asking,

1362
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
when tempering, can you keep previous rolls?

1363
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Can you keep previous rolls?

1364
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Oh, like the enchanting system.

1365
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Oh, I see.

1366
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1367
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Yeah, currently right now we don't have the functionality to let you keep the roll.

1368
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Right now if you're going to commit to rerolling, you're going to lose that previous one.

1369
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
You're committing to rerolling.

1370
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Yeah, it's sort of like the blacksmith is hammering on that item and unlocking different aspects of the weapon.

1371
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
You sort of lose what you previously had.

1372
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
But we're open to feedback, right? It's a completely new feature.

1373
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
We really want to hear how it's playing, and ultimately what we want is a fun crafting feature.

1374
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So, you know, that sort of feedback is really valuable.

1375
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
We'll take two more, and one is from Matt LOL.

1376
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Is tempering going to allow changes for the skill type, like maybe Lightning Hydras,

1377
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,000
or maybe changes to Blizzard where it's a Reign of Fire or something like that?

1378
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
That's pretty cool.

1379
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Honestly, anything an Apex can do.

1380
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Yeah.

1381
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It is open season of things we could potentially do in the future, yeah.

1382
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Not in season four, but, you know, possibly in the future.

1383
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Awesome.

1384
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And this is actually from a...

1385
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
There's a lot of space to grow.

1386
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
There is.

1387
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Utility is a category that we could do.

1388
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Yeah.

1389
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
There's a lot of space to do interesting things potentially.

1390
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Yeah.

1391
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Yeah.

1392
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:11,000
There's a lot of questions in here about like additional character customization options and stuff like that coming in the future.

1393
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:21,000
It is like something that the team is always looking at adding additional things to for players to have more choice of what they want to do, especially as they're creating characters.

1394
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:34,000
And of course, being able to obtain those, like even just some things in season four, being able to get additional, you know, cosmetic things for your mount and everything like that is something that the team is most definitely looking at.

1395
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Yeah.

1396
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
We actually, we care about this a great deal.

1397
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:48,000
So, I think one thing that's very interesting about Diablo 4, or a problem that we have that's very specific, right, is there are actually quite a few cosmetics for players to earn out on bosses and things, like throughout the game.

1398
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Like there's lots of things for players to collect cosmetically in the game.

1399
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
But it's really hard to know that that drops off that thing.

1400
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Yeah.

1401
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
In Diablo 4.

1402
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Like you can go and you can fight a world boss 50 times and not have a drop occur for you, right?

1403
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Like then eventually you get your special horse and you're like, oh, oh, okay.

1404
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
It is here, but you have no idea.

1405
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
It's kind of like, it's harder to know exactly where to grind.

1406
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:14,000
We're actually talking about that a bit on the dev side, see if like, there's more ways we can kind of like make it clear where certain things can be found, which I think could be really fun.

1407
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Yeah.

1408
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
But I think that there's work we can do there.

1409
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
And also, there's still work we can do about just trying to get more cool looks into the game.

1410
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,000
So we've been talking a lot more with the various teams inside Diablo 4.

1411
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
And there's a broad agreement we want to bring more cool stuff to you guys.

1412
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And more cool stuff for players to find and pick up and equip and feel like it was really exciting to get that thing.

1413
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:41,000
One thing we're doing like already is, like as we develop more uniques, we're trying to make sure that we have like more unique appearances to go with all of them.

1414
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Usually we have like a lot of really, really fun ideas.

1415
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:50,000
We have to constantly like wrestle with like, alright, we only have like this X many swords, but like we have like this many ideas for swords.

1416
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
And we want to like try to get this in the game.

1417
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
We want to wait till we have the artwork for a sword.

1418
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
We usually try to make sure that we've got a fun toy to immediately give you.

1419
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
But we're going to make sure we're trying to get more of that stuff in game as well.

1420
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
So there's just even more artwork to the unique system for players to collect.

1421
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Awesome.

1422
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So that's all the time we've got right here for today.

1423
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
We went over all the changes, or not actually there's even more changes.

1424
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
There's actually more changes in the patch notes.

1425
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
We can't go through every single line in the patch notes over a stream.

1426
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
So you guys can actually check out the patch notes.

1427
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Those will be available on Diablo4.com.

1428
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
We always have those listed on our specific patch notes page.

1429
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
And those will be live immediately after this stream.

1430
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Season 4, Loot Reborn, starts on May 14th.

1431
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
This is across all platforms.

1432
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It's on PC, Xbox, PlayStation.

1433
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:47,000
And of course if you're an Xbox and PC Game Pass user, you can also play Diablo 4 now via PC Battle.net or on your Xbox.

1434
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
So lots of opportunities to play.

1435
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
And of course Steam.

1436
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Steam. Can't forget Steam.

1437
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Steam is also on there for PC.

1438
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
That's also a platform.

1439
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
That is also a platform.

1440
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
We're everywhere.

1441
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Any other platforms you wanted to shout out?

1442
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
We're everywhere.

1443
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
We're everywhere.

1444
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
We're everywhere.

1445
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Just everywhere.

1446
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
But again, thanks to everyone for tuning in.

1447
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
We're looking forward to you guys jumping into Season 4 Loot Reborn.

1448
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And yeah, we'll see you guys in game.

1449
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And thanks again.

1450
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Yeah.

1451
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
See you guys.

1452
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Bye.

1453
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Bye.
