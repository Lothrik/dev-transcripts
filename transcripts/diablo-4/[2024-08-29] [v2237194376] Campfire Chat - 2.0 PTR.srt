01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
and now we've kind of completed it and we've added a darkness or shadow damage ultimate

195
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,000
soul rift creates an area around your character kind of follows with you that just constantly

196
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:48,000
deals damage over time and it's going to be sucking out the souls of enemies who you're hitting

197
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
and every time it sucks out a soul from an enemy you're going to gain some essence and you're going

198
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
to gain a barrier so you can stack up this barrier it helps you be survivable um and it deals you know

199
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:03,000
really good damage over time supreme soul rift gives you bonus damage for every soul that you absorb

200
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:08,000
and prime soul rift causes the soul absorption to also apply vulnerable let's take a video of this

201
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:15,000
in action here right so enemies are all coming up super useful charles right now that like you have

202
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:20,000
another way to give yourself defenses uh necro has historically had some trouble with that right

203
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
yeah absolutely uh i think that's a really important part here um and when we get to the

204
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
the next slide talk about some of the passives we'll i'll highlight we're adding a bit more

205
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:35,000
barrier into the necromancer's kit um you know blood necromancers always had a really easy time

206
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,000
surviving they had a lot of fortify and a lot of max health um and really they the other ones like

207
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,000
the bone and shadow uh necro didn't have quite as much survivability and so now we're introducing

208
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,000
more barrier in more places to ensure that that kind of non-blood necromancer builds the shadow and

209
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
the bone and summon necros um have a bit more survivability and are able to scale into that late game

210
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:02,000
pretty well all right so as i mentioned the new passive so they have a new key passive called

211
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:09,000
affliction that uh there's this new concept of affliction where um applying vulnerable crowd

212
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:16,000
control or shadow damage over time effects to enemies will apply them with affliction which is

213
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,000
going to make them take increased damage from you and your minions additionally when you apply a curse

214
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:27,000
skill to someone or to an enemy who has this affliction you're going to do a big chunk of

215
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:32,000
shadow damage so this kind of turns your your curse skills your decrepify and iron maiden into

216
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
offensive skills you can curse an area and then they take a big chunk of damage as well

217
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:44,000
um and this will scale up with the bonus damage that you've dealt uh or that you or the bonus affixes

218
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:49,000
that you have for that crowd control vulnerable and shadow damage and along that same theme the new

219
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:54,000
legendary paragon node frailty is going to cause cursed enemies to take more damage from you and

220
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:01,000
so it plays very nicely with the affliction key passive and uh once again more uh more skill tree

221
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,000
passives to spend those extra points on and i want to highlight necrotic fortitude here in the upper right

222
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
that gives you uh it's just a generic passive that gives you a chance a lucky hit chance to gain a

223
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
barrier and so that's going to be really good for anybody who wants just a bit more bump of

224
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:21,000
survivability and to play into the more barrier focused uh on necromancer uh yeah going back to

225
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:28,000
affliction really quick i love the idea of using my curses uh offensively like as a damage skill i think

226
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:35,000
that's going to be such a blast yeah yeah it's really cool to just yeah definitely gonna gonna be blasting

227
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:42,000
with them um i think it's really thematic too i love playing with it it pairs really well with the utility

228
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:48,000
changes now that we have way more size increases in utility gives you so many more utility options

229
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:54,000
those curses get pretty huge um and it feels great yeah yeah for all of us who just want to win by debuff

230
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:02,000
spamming i love that one absolutely all right let's talk about some of the new items coming for

231
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:09,000
necromancer here so we've got a new unique item the unmaker a unique helm this is going to empower the

232
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:15,000
soul rift the the new uh ultimate skill of course you gain some skill ranks to soul rift because now

233
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:22,000
ultimate skills have skill ranks and every 30 essence that you spend while soul rift is active

234
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,000
will increase its duration up to eight seconds so as long as you're active and kind of spending the

235
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,000
essence with the unmaker you're gonna have a very long duration of soul rift and then for every essence

236
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:39,000
that you gain while it's active which absorbing the souls does trigger essence gain you're going to do a

237
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,000
pulse of damage around you some bonus damage and so it really encourages you to just keep soul rift

238
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:50,000
up all the time be constantly gaining and spending the essence and it's going to be really really fun to

239
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:56,000
to make that build work additionally we've got reaping lotus aspect this empowers your sever your core

240
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
skill uh sever will no longer return to you previously sever was kind of an out and back situation now it

241
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,000
just goes out and then it splits into three specters at the end deals some extra bonus damage and then

242
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,000
that's the the end of the sever so it really does empower it on on the the swing out uh and looks

243
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:18,000
really cool uh we've got aspect of fell gluttony that empowers your golem whenever you cast your

244
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,000
golems active deals a big pulse of damage around it and your golem will then consume corpses to reduce

245
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
its cooldown so anybody who really wants to to build around making your golem as strong as possible this is

246
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:35,000
going to be the aspect for you and finally we've got phasing poltergeist's aspect which causes your bone

247
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:41,000
spirit to split into three spirits that deal a percentage of the damage as well i think we got

248
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
a video clip of this one because it looks really sweet uh so you cast bone spirit at one target and

249
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
then it spawns three little mini bone spirits to seek out nearby enemies as well so it kind of gives

250
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:56,000
you increased area of effect and if there's just one target of course it'll reconverge back on that same

251
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
target as well but also just adds a you know a bit more aoe capability for your bone spirit build

252
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:12,000
very cool all right so rogue rogue gets dance of knives this is a new channeled skill for rogue

253
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:18,000
it's an agility cutthroat skill and it also has a pretty interesting mechanic where it has some

254
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:24,000
charges that will recharge and the how long you can channel it is based on how many charges you have

255
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,000
it's going to take one charge per second of channeling but there's no energy cost or or just like

256
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
a normal cooldown uh here you can just channel it as long as you have charges and while you're

257
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
channeling you're gonna be spinning around you're gonna be throwing knives at enemies nearby and uh

258
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:44,000
you're against movement speed and dodge chance uh really is kind of like a spin to win kind of build

259
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,000
uh on rogue here uh you've got enhanced dance of knives which gives you some charge refund as you're

260
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
moving with it because that's what we really want to encourage is this constant motion this this forward

261
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:00,000
um momentum and uh methodical dance of knives drop some stun grenades when you finish channeling or

262
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
discipline dance of knives will slow enemies and has a chance to pierce through the enemies that

263
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:10,000
you're you're throwing the daggers at let's take a look at this in action so here we got the rogue

264
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:15,000
just going spinning throwing some daggers around at everyone and uh yeah this is awesome

265
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:24,000
speed farming like the best speed farming yeah and that animation is just amazing absolutely and you

266
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
can see there at the end they had the upgrade that drops a bunch of stun grenades at the end obviously

267
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
enemies were all dead but you know if you you use this to get into a big cluster of enemies then you

268
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:37,000
stop the channel you drop some stun grenades reset some of your charges and and you're good to start

269
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:42,000
spinning again ton of fun yeah those are perfect for like you run into an elite pack after slaughtering

270
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:49,000
a bunch of normals and it just annihilates the elites it feels amazing yeah all right so we've got

271
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:56,000
new passives as well uh new key passive is alchemical admixture and this is empowering your non-physical

272
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:03,000
damage so rogues can do poison shadow and cold through their various imbuements and when you deal three

273
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
different types of that non-physical damage the potency of your imbuement skills is going to be

274
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
dramatically increased for a time and the more bonus damage that you build on your gear for

275
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:18,000
bonus poison shot over cold damage the further that potency gets increased really encouraging

276
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
you to to mix and match the different elements it's really thematic with you know the alchemical kind of

277
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
theme and uh really uh supporting a build of rogue that we've kind of had in the game but really wanted

278
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:34,000
to give that robust support of a key passive for and also we've got a legendary paragon node the dance

279
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:39,000
macabre which encourages this kind of one-two combo of casting mobility or subterfuge skill increases

280
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
the damage of your next skill whatever it might be by quite a substantial amount so you can you know

281
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
cast your dash and then you know position yourself cast a big rain of arrows and it hits very hard

282
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
very cool and uh actually impacts your your moment to moment rotation as well

283
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
and of course we've got the new skill tree passes as well

284
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:07,000
all right new items we've got the pit fighters gall this is the ancestral unique ring or sorry just it's a

285
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:12,000
unique ring it's not necessarily you can find it before ancestral tier uh and this pit fighters gall

286
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:17,000
will empower your smoke grenade so your smoke grenade skill will deal in will increase your critical

287
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
strike damage and then leave a cloud of shadows behind and while you're within that cloud of

288
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
shadows you're going to be constantly regaining stealth and so there's a lot of interesting ways

289
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,000
you can play off of triggering going into or out of stealth and pit fighters gall is just going to

290
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
really enable that when you cast smoke grenade we've got aspect of star shards this is a new legendary

291
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:42,000
to directly support dance of knives and the daggers from dance of knives have a chance to shatter

292
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,000
dealing uh creating more shards of metal that deal bonus damage and you can now use combo points on

293
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
dance of knives to further increase the channel duration if you've opted into the combo points

294
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:58,000
specialization aspect of poisonous clouds plays well with pit fighters gall when you gain stealth you create a

295
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,000
cloud of poison damage and aspect of splendor shards uh there's just a chance whenever you're hitting a

296
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:11,000
frozen enemy to create some ice spikes so if you're freezing enemies because you're playing alchemical

297
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
admixture and using cold imbue splendor shards might be a good aspect for you as well

298
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:25,000
all right moving on to the sorceress the sorceress gets a new conjuration skill called the familiar

299
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:30,000
this is a conjuration skill that is all three elements it is a shock skill a pyromancy skill and

300
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:38,000
a frost skill so you there's three charges of it so you can cast it uh you know back to back and some

301
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:45,000
you summon a familiar of the element of your last skill cast so if you just cast a pyromancy skill

302
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,000
you're going to summon a fire familiar if you just cast a lightning skill you'll summon a lightning

303
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:56,000
familiar and same with a cold you'll summon a cold familiar and with the enhanced effect these familiars

304
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:02,000
will uh do a bonus effect so the fire familiar will constantly apply some burning to enemies that

305
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:07,000
it's around the cold familiar will chill and lightning familiar will stun and of course they'll their

306
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,000
damage type is going to be based on you know what type they are so that it'll benefit from all of your

307
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:17,000
you know bonus fire damage and that aura is really great right to tap into some of the keep or the

308
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:24,000
passives on the sorcerer yeah absolutely so you know if there's a lot of passive that say hey you

309
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,000
get bonuses uh against burning enemies for instance now if you have a fire familiar that's going to

310
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
really easily be able to apply that constantly and you're going to have pretty high uptime on having

311
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,000
familiars out because of the way the charge and duration works let's take a look at this in action

312
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:46,000
all right so initially we cast a frost familiar here right it it's jumping around and it's landing

313
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,000
it's doing frost damage then we cast a fire skill now we get a fire familiar jumping around and and

314
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:56,000
kind of dive bombing on enemies and then finally we get a shock familiar a lightning familiar here that's

315
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,000
going to be a lightning damage so you can kind of mix and match these uh depending on what skills you

316
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:08,000
use what combination you cast them in and uh it's really flexible it fits into a lot of different builds

317
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
you know even if you're just a pure say fire sword you just want to do fire damage you just want to do

318
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
burning this could still fit because you're just going to be able to summon the fire familiar but

319
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:21,000
it really reaches its maximum potential as you're you're kind of mix and matching these to to suit the

320
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:27,000
situation and and apply the the debuffs that you want onto the enemies you can have quite a few of

321
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:32,000
these out for the sega demonstration i think we we only have a couple of them out on screen but i think

322
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:38,000
you can have up to like six right yeah you can have up to six and uh that would make a lot more sense

323
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,000
once we get to uh talk about some of the the unique items uh that are coming with this patch

324
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:52,000
but first let's talk about the new passives and uh we've got enlightenment uh this really also plays

325
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
into the concept of mixing and matching the elements you see it's got all all three kind of colors on

326
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:03,000
there casting a skill grants a stack of enlightenment or three stacks if your skill was a different element

327
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:08,000
to the one before so you're alternating here and whenever you gain max stacks you're going

328
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
to become enlightened and you get a ton of bonuses for being in this enlightened state but then it

329
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,000
it drops off over time it's really a reward for mixing and matching those elements more so than any

330
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:24,000
other key passes we've had on srk before and similarly with the legendary paragon node fundamental release

331
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,000
each fire lightning cold attack you make in centimee increase the damage they take from all sources

332
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
uh by 10 so you really need to hit them with all three types to gain the maximum bonus here

333
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:44,000
all right on to the the unique items so uh siday bindings this is a unique gloves and this plays

334
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:50,000
right into the familiar so whenever you cast familiar with this unique on you're going to summon all three

335
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,000
elemental variants at once however it does come with a bit of restrictions on it so familiar's duration

336
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:02,000
is going to be dramatically increased and it's cooldown reduced but you're going to have one less charge of it

337
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:07,000
so you you won't be able to spam uh this quite as much but you know you press the button once or twice

338
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,000
and then you get the maximum familiar result they're all over the screen and they're going to last for

339
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:16,000
quite a long time with this with this unique love so it's going to be really really powerful too if you're

340
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
all about this conjuration build all about amping up the power from the familiar it's an awesome unique

341
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:27,000
for that additionally we've got new legendaries for the aspect of overheating after channeling incinerate

342
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:34,000
for a time you're going to deal bonus damage to the target and uh casting incinerate will uh refresh and

343
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:41,000
maintain the bonus so uh really just powering up your incinerate uh charged flash this empowers charged

344
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
bolts and after you hit a certain number of enemies with charged bolts your next three cast of charge

345
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:51,000
bolts will no longer send out bolts they're going to sound big waves of lightning that deal even more

346
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:58,000
damage and it's always going to be a crit and then aspect of elemental constellation once again uh more

347
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:04,000
about the the mixing and matching of all three elements uh casting a one of the elemental skills

348
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:10,000
will summon a matching type elemental dagger that'll pierce through enemies and uh if you the damage of

349
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:15,000
that dagger is going to be increased if you get all three of the different element types in that time frame

350
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:23,000
all right so i think uh oh right we've got myth new mythic uniques of course how can i forget new

351
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:30,000
mythic unique items these are the strongest items in the game uh we've got shroud of false death and i

352
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,000
think the really cool part about this is uh it's just inherent ethics it's going to grant plus one skill

353
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
rank to all passives and this is really awesome as we're adding new passives into the skill tree this

354
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:48,000
is just a ton of power for this this new unique uh chest and it's it's effect is what if you haven't

355
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:54,000
attacked in the last two seconds you're going to gain stealth and bonus movement speed now stealth

356
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,000
historically has just been a mechanic that has been on rogues and a little bit on druids with the werewolf

357
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:03,000
builds but now every class if you get this mythic unique is going to have some access to stealth you can

358
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
you know drop out of combat for a little bit and then you you get into self and you get tons

359
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
movement speed to you know maybe move on to the next pack or or move somewhere else in the dungeon

360
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:18,000
and it's a really simple line all passives but it's literally all passives which is insane like

361
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:27,000
it's incredibly powerful absolutely and we've also got the air of perdition a mythic unique helm

362
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:34,000
and this one has as an interesting effect so it's it says give into hatred and earn lilith's favor

363
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
increasing your damage dealt by 60 percent so just baseline this is a huge damage bonus

364
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,000
and the second line here says slaughtering enemies to briefly steal lilith's favor from

365
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:51,000
or slaughter enemies to briefly steal lilith's favor from nearby allies so this means if you're playing

366
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
in a group with uh you know somebody else who happens to have the air of perdition equipped you

367
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:02,000
are able to steal lilith's favor from them both will only favor one of you and you actually gain

368
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
double the bonus of this right if you you have if you steal someone else's favor you get 120 bonus

369
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:12,000
damage and and they would get zero uh but if you're just playing this solo no one else has

370
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:18,000
their prediction around it's just a flat 60 bonus damage which is still a ton and very impactful for a

371
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:26,000
a mythic unique all right i believe that is actually everything wow that is so much new class content new

372
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:31,000
skills new legendaries new new everything and i didn't even get to talk about some of our other uh

373
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:36,000
you know more regular class balance changes you know updates to existing skills and legendaries

374
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
so make sure you definitely check out the patch notes there is still more changes to come but we're

375
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
already really deep into this campfire chat and uh we didn't want to extend it too too much longer so

376
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,000
make sure you check out the passion it's for all the details on those other changes coming as well

377
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:58,000
yeah thank you so much charles um i know we have gone through a lot of information we're in our 1.5 of

378
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,000
this campfire chat as i said and i mentioned on on social like this is going to be a very beefy

379
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,000
campfire chat we still have two more things that we do want to really cover off uh uh and as charles

380
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
had mentioned um there are a lot of other class changes that we didn't actually fit within the

381
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,000
presentation like a lot of balance specific items so that will be on patch notes and patch notes will be

382
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:24,000
available on our blog for ptr immediately after the stream so please check that out um we are going

383
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:29,000
to jump into some quality of life items and so uh colin do you want to take us through some quick

384
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:35,000
quality of life items i'll be coming with 2.0 yeah i'll go quick so we can get to the the super exciting

385
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:43,000
cool thing um yeah so the first one here is you can now select your preferred town portal location

386
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
so how that's going to work is you're going to open up the map and hover over any of the waypoints and

387
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
when you right click on it it's going to set that as essentially your preferred location and whenever

388
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:56,000
you town portal it's going to take you there so this is really helpful for when you're doing whispers

389
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:02,000
for example you just set the tree of whispers as your preferred location do some whispers when you

390
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
press t you go right there you don't have to open up the map then click on the waypoint then click on

391
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:11,000
accept like it's all very seamless and it's just removing a lot of the inputs that you have to do to

392
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:19,000
get back to town quickly the next thing here is we're adding a dungeon key inventory tab for things

393
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:25,000
like nightmare sigils so that just gives you more space for more activities so much room for activities

394
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,000
the next one here is we've done a pretty substantial rework of monster cc and this is in the spirit of

395
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:39,000
we want to have really clear sort of delineations between normal monsters and elite monsters and we

396
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:45,000
didn't like how often you're getting slowed down and how mandatory unstoppable could feel um so you

397
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
know it always felt bad to be fighting this huge horde of enemies and you see this elite and you're

398
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:54,000
paying attention to the elite and then like this goat man mauler comes up and like sneak attacks you

399
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
and knocks you down for three seconds and that's the thing that kills you that always felt like

400
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:03,000
bullshit right so what we've done is we've sort of overhauled a lot of the normal monster cc's to be

401
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
quick and snappy like you still feel them you kind of want to avoid them still um but they're much less

402
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:14,000
sort of the reason why you die entirely so the vampire impale when like the the two-hander like

403
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
comes and stabs you and stuns you for three seconds that's turned into an immobilize so you can't move

404
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,000
but you can just smack him in the face um and then the werewolf leap is another great example where

405
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,000
previously they'd come out of stealth and like uh leap attack on you and you get dazed and you'd walk

406
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,000
around confused and now they just does it does a quick knockback um this next change here is small but

407
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:40,000
i think it's a blaster's delight which is all the monsters that had really long death animations

408
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
all die instantly you don't have to wait for the loot to hit the ground it's very satisfying you

409
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:49,000
know the big ass like spider hosts that crawl towards you when you kill them they pop instantly

410
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:54,000
and all the spiders go and hit the walls and it feels great the zombies feel really good too it like

411
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
they pop instantly when you kill them um and it's a very satisfying experience so this should speed up

412
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:09,000
combat quite a bit and it just feels really good the next thing here is their socketable inventory tab

413
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:16,000
another tab for you for you to put socketables like gems and other socketables and then there's also an

414
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:22,000
additional stash tab that we're going to add the next thing if we could roll the clip we took out just

415
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:22,000
about all the

416
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:31,000
all would go up and then like click on the plunger and don't get hit by the spikes that's all been

417
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:37,000
replaced entirely with just monster packs of varying sizes and it's just way more seamless in this case

418
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
we only rolled some normal monsters but sometimes it's a couple of elite packs you never really know

419
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:46,000
what you're going to get it's like an easter or a kinder egg i should say and it just helps the dungeon

420
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:51,000
flow substantially like to just sort of blast through those things and then a handle full of dungeons have

421
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:56,000
had their procedural logic updated just so there's more variation in the layout so when you play it

422
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
it's just going to roll out differently this is really just iterating on our dungeon set to make

423
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,000
them feel much more sort of flow inducing not slowing you down and then the next one here is is

424
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
minor but actually feels uh pretty good and it has a big impact on the game when you get those paragon

425
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:15,000
and level up notifications we're actually going to tell you how many so sometimes you'll realize oh my

426
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:21,000
god i have like 15 skill points i can spend um and it actually tells you the number it's a nice quality of

427
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:28,000
life change so i think that's everything awesome thank you colin for running through quickly i

428
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:36,000
appreciate the efficiency of of going through all the quality of life changes um now i know uh jivan

429
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,000
has been very quiet over here he's only chimed in a little bit uh and we do want to talk about a new

430
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:49,000
thing that is coming to vessel of hatred specifically and for vessel of hatred players so jivan will you uh will

431
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:56,000
you talk us through it a little bit yeah so it's uh it's my privilege to kind of talk about a feature

432
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:03,000
that the whole team's been working very hard on that we haven't really um mentioned much and you

433
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:10,000
know we we uh looked at the expansion we had all these cool things you know um torment new class skills

434
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,000
spirit born but we thought there was a hole um and we we wanted to particularly give

435
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:24,000
build crafters a new way to play for vessel of hatred um this is for folks who like me uh whose dream

436
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:31,000
cooking show has nothing to do with british baking but instead would be called collins kitchen um push

437
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:38,000
chat if you would binge collins kitchen let us know um so uh yeah let's and i think some of you already

438
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:51,000
kind of have an idea um so yeah let's uh let's let's get into uh as some of you already know we're going

439
01:57:51,000 --> 01:58:00,000
to be talking about runewords yeah so um let's let's start with a little background um so runewords were

440
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:07,000
in diablo 2 and they were a very powerful way of augmenting gear with socketable content and there's a

441
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,000
lot of good sort of nostalgic feelings they were popular they were remembered fondly you can look

442
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:18,000
on the right that's one of the most iconic um examples from diablo 2 uh the the name is enigma

443
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:24,000
and you would make it with runes ja if burr and it would get you some some really cool skills that

444
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:33,000
would come out of it when you put it all together um and for diablo 4 we wanted to retain the soul of

445
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:38,000
what diablo 2 runewords did which is combining socketable components and creating more powerful

446
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:45,000
items um but we also wanted to do something that felt appropriately fresh and new and we wanted to

447
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,000
lean into what's unique about the modern game to make the diablo 4 version of runewords and make it

448
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:57,000
stand on its own and really feel like the right version to be giving to players yeah and what was so

449
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:03,000
awesome about diablo 2 runewords right was you got the set of runes that made a god item right and

450
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,000
it broke the rules like being able to teleport on other classes like what the hell barbarian is

451
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:13,000
teleporting across the screen we really wanted to embrace that in a way that extended builds and and

452
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:19,000
didn't necessarily enforce you must play with this item and we're really excited to share what that's

453
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:24,000
sort of manifested right yeah and you all have a lot of builds that you you started with from the

454
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
base game and we want to add on to those

455
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:34,000
so what are runewords they're a way for you to make your own spells so there are two types of

456
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:40,000
runes there's runes of ritual and they specify actions from the player that they have to trigger

457
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,000
so you can see the example here of the yule rune which is a legendary quality rune ritual you have to

458
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:50,000
cast a skill which has a cooldown so you know frost nova or something like that then you have runes of

459
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:57,000
invocation and these grant powerful effects as a result of satisfying those runes of ritual so

460
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
the example here the gar rune gives you two and a half percent critical strike chance for five

461
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:07,000
seconds and you can stack up to ten times up to 25 and you can mix and match these there'll be a lot

462
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,000
of different runes of ritual and runes of invocation you can put them together as you see fit

463
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
so when you combine a rune of ritual and rune of invocation you pair them together

464
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,000
you put them in an item with two sockets boom you form form a runeword

465
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,000
and as you can tell there's going to be rarity we're going to have magic rare and legendary and

466
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
the higher rarity runes will have more potent conditions or effects

467
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:38,000
so one of the one of the important elements of this is called offering which is the rune resource

468
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,000
system so your runes of ritual will generate offering and they're meant to feed into their

469
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:48,000
linked runes of invocation so that they can consume that offering and the sort of more demanding

470
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:53,000
rituals that we would ask of you as a player gain you more offering at the same time the more

471
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,000
powerful invocations that you would try to get require more offering and so there's sort of a sort

472
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:03,000
of like shared economy there so if you can look at these runes on the right you get 50 offering for

473
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:10,000
casting a skill with the cooldown and this rune only requires 25 offering for it to trigger that's where

474
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
overflow comes in overflow is when an invocation receives an offering in excess of what's needed

475
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:20,000
to trigger it but put more simply it's we want you to have a mix and match system but we want the

476
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:25,000
pieces to be um not super hard that they can't fit together easily when they have some rough edges

477
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
so many invocations can get different bonus effects when overflowed some of them might get increased

478
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
radius to the effect some of them might get increased duration but it'll always be proportional to the

479
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:41,000
overflow amount so as an example here um the garb rune only requires 25 offering and it's getting

480
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:46,000
double that which is 50 from the yulb rune so every time you cast this skill with a cooldown you'll

481
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:52,000
get two stacks of 2.5 critical strike strike chance or 5 crit strike and so that's kind of how you get to

482
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:59,000
play with this system and you get to optimize it in different ways and it creates a lot of flexibility

483
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:05,000
right even like if you do a really demanding ritual trigger for example on a really low offering

484
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
rune of invocation it's almost a way to start scaling that rune of invocation in a completely

485
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:17,000
different way beyond just triggering the rune exactly yeah it lets us it lets us as developers

486
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:23,000
be more flexible in creating wide ranges of effects you know sort of small ones big ones and and also the

487
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:29,000
same for the rituals and you get to kind of decide which ones you think fit your build or are cool and

488
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
we do our best to make sure that you can almost cook up anything

489
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:44,000
so a few rules um runes can be socketed into items with two sockets um we've added a new another item

490
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:49,000
to get two sockets for vessel of hatred the uh so you'll have your helm your two-hander your gloves and

491
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:55,000
sorry your helm two-hander pants and chest um they can only be paired with a rune of the opposite type so you

492
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:00,000
have to pair a rune of ritual with a rune of invocation you can have a maximum of two runewords

493
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:07,000
equipped you can't equip the same rune twice and they're available for users who own vessel of hatred

494
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,000
they stack in your inventory in the new socketable inventory tab which will also have your gems

495
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:17,000
rune of the new socket and runes and runes are tradable between other players who own vessel of hatred

496
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:26,000
and they unlock with a quest in the campaign both runes dropping from as loot but also runecrafting

497
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:32,000
which we'll get into later and they drop at a higher rate in the undercity which is a specific

498
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:38,000
place you can farm them so now let's get into some clips here we get to actually see it in action so this

499
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:46,000
is a barbarian and the rune of ritual they have is travel five meters very simple and they're going

500
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
to join that to the earthquake which is a legendary aspect that you've already seen before which requires

501
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:58,000
100 offering so you see we'll put them together in this item and then all they have to do is just

502
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:04,000
run around boom earthquakes dropping insane with the paragon legendary glyph we just talked about

503
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:14,000
the earthquake train is leaving the station what i love about this is it doesn't it doesn't just count

504
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
your normal walking right if you're leaping if you're charging that's all counting towards like

505
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:24,000
the distance that you're moving right oh whoa and you can see it here in like the whirlwind for instance

506
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
like it's obviously spawning earthquakes so was that a druid petrify ultimate that's this is this

507
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,000
must be the wrong clip all right sorry guys you know we're doing it live let's just move on to the next one

508
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:40,000
um okay so we have a necromancer here with the rune of ritual cast a non-channel core skill getting

509
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:45,000
25 each and then this is a classic from d2 gain plus three to all skills

510
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:54,000
um so you'll get to see this necro's got five uh five skill ranks for reap and sever

511
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:01,000
and they're just gonna go out and casual socketable harlequin crest pretty good

512
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:15,000
so a little pew pew just doing your basic uh core skill usage filling up the offering needed

513
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
yeah i really like the the little tracking buff that like fills up as you as you're getting it so you

514
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,000
don't need to really micromanage this you can just add a glance see that hey i just filled it up and

515
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:31,000
now i get plus three ranks of sever yep so now you're a plus three there you go what was that so yeah

516
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:38,000
this this this necro is just cooking and um oh what is this another another broken clip did they just

517
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:48,000
cast teleport what it what okay i i i think i think you guys 40 necros what are you cooking over there jivan

518
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:57,000
yeah i'll stop making jokes mostly um yeah so what we really wanted to lean into with d2 runewords

519
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:01,000
among other things was the ability to cast other classes skills and use their power and harness it

520
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:07,000
into your build so with runewords you're going to get to do that uh each class is going to share two

521
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:13,000
skills and one legendary aspect like the uh the earthquake one that you saw um and some of them are

522
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:19,000
even going to get get to cast improved versions so for instance you know instead of um the standard

523
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,000
decrepify from the necromancer you get to cast horrid decrepify which is the upgraded version

524
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
and that's kind of we did that for a lot of reasons you know we wanted to make some of them

525
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,000
feel a little better and a little more powerful and a lot of it is about balance but one important

526
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:39,000
thing that i always want to um highlight here is that you always cast the best version of the skill if

527
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:44,000
you have upgrades as the sort of homeowner of the class right so what that means is let's say you're

528
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:50,000
a spirit born and you equip the cry rune which is the vortex spell if you have points into the upgrade

529
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:57,000
then you'll cast the upgraded vortex when the rune goes off so i don't think there'll be any class envy

530
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
you know like everyone will get the best version of their own skills and then they'll get to use other

531
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:06,000
classes skills and um we're really excited to see how people can can construct new builds and new

532
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:12,000
archetypes and and what they can do with using the power of the classes and that says enhanced war

533
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:21,000
cry so that means necros can become berserk right that indeed does mean that and uh and and that

534
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,000
enhanced war cry is a winner i gotta say that one's real strong we've already seen people just chopping

535
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:32,000
up the the pit with that one absolutely really looking forward to what kind of interesting new

536
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:38,000
combinations and builds you can come up with by by dipping into other class skills uh in in unique

537
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:43,000
ways it really just like multiplies the possibilities of of what you can do with any given class

538
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:50,000
yeah exactly and not only do we want you to augment your builds with other classes skills but

539
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:55,000
you know runes will scale with gear so when you get more interesting runes of rituals you'll find ways

540
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:00,000
to optimize them as well and get more output so we really feel like people will have a lot of theory

541
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,000
crafting that they can build off of the runeword system and i'm very excited to see how you break

542
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,000
the game by the way that's what she do she's doing ptr for me just break break the game see every build

543
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:15,000
you can find that that totally destroys everything um so now we have the crafting element um so using

544
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:20,000
three of the same rune you can use them to roll a new rune you go to the jeweler or it might not be the

545
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:25,000
jeweler but we'll see um and you will combine three of the same exact rune and you'll get a new rune out

546
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:31,000
that is guaranteed to be different than the rune you put in and there's a chance to uproll it to

547
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:36,000
the next highest rarity so if you put three magic runes in there's a chance that it'll be a rare rune

548
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:41,000
same with same with rare there's a chance that it'll be a legendary rune um and then on top of

549
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:47,000
that we'll have the ability to craft mythic uniques so you can use runes um each route each mythic unique

550
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:53,000
can be crafted with a specific set of runes you'll need a legendary rare and magic runes of a certain

551
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:59,000
quantity and one resplendent spark and this is in addition to the existing mythic uni crafting flow

552
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:08,000
so um yeah i was just gonna say this really harkens back to the sort of crafting that was so core in d2

553
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
with the ruins of being able to match three and get the next upgrade but in a way that's a little bit

554
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:18,000
more flexible and gives you more progression out of it and this is all tradable right so that match

555
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:25,000
three those crafting mythic uniques what do you think that's going to do with trading yeah i mean

556
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:32,000
i i think it's going to really build a sort of player community around how to acquire the runes

557
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:36,000
you need whether it's because you want to combine you know you have two and you want to find that

558
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,000
third one to combine for a new one or you're hunting for a specific mythic unique i think we're

559
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,000
going to have a lot of player interaction and well someone's going to win the capitalism game there so

560
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:52,000
we'll see how that goes i really like how how the uh the rune crafting system makes it so you're kind

561
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,000
of always progressing right if you're getting room drops then then you're you're you're getting

562
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:01,000
materials that you know you can use to progress towards higher rarity runes and potentially towards

563
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:06,000
these mythic unique items unlike uh you know some of the other loot drops you know if you don't find a

564
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:11,000
good piece of gear it just ends up being salvage here with runes you're kind of constantly getting

565
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:17,000
some of that progression even if it's not always the perfect room right now yeah i think that's

566
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:24,000
something that we we did talk to a lot of sort of d2 diehards when we we built runewords and one of the

567
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,000
things that most of them tended to mention consistently was like every rune drop is progress

568
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
right you're always moving up that ladder and so we wanted to make sure that even if you didn't get

569
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:40,000
the exact thing you wanted it still meant something to you one way or another well i know uh we have

570
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:46,000
we've talked a lot about a lot of stuff today we we had a progression itemization uh we talked about

571
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:51,000
quality of life we talked about class uh changes and of course the newest thing which is runewords

572
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:57,000
which will be in vessel of hatred um but the one thing we did want to quickly talk about was ptr

573
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:03,000
ptr is coming up uh and we want to give a little bit or at least some specifics on what that ptr test is

574
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:08,000
going to be and also hear from the team on exactly like what they're looking for uh from you guys out

575
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:13,000
there that are playing like for feedback uh as you guys play through the systems everything that

576
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:19,000
we've actually talked about today is going to be present in this ptr so uh all the class balance

577
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:26,000
changes the progression changes uh runewords will also be part of the ptr so we actually do want

578
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:33,000
players jumping in uh and checking it out so uh let's jump right into some of the ptr items so uh as

579
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:40,000
everyone knows uh ptr uh from even the last ptr that we had uh will carry over content from your

580
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
main account so if you've already done all your renown cleared your fog of war your altar will

581
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:52,000
stat uh uh status will carry over onto your ptr account uh we did do a character copy as well it was

582
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:58,000
a while back though so uh there there you may find that it might be a little dated from like the character

583
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:05,000
copy that you have on live but uh that will exist for players to actually use um one thing i will

584
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:11,000
note is that we are planning on having two different testing phases for ptr specifically uh the first

585
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:19,000
testing phase will actually begin next wednesday uh and will run through friday about midday where we're

586
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:25,000
going to actually give players the opportunity of kind of just starting characters from fresh because we

587
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:32,000
really need people to try out the new progression systems that uh colin and hazeln were talking about

588
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:38,000
specifically in the beginning of the stream so wednesday through midday friday we really need players

589
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:45,000
to jump in check that out give us feedback specifically uh regarding anything tied to the new progression

590
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:52,000
systems around midday on friday though we will be turning on the rest of the ptr which will include

591
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:57,000
things like ruin words and and all the other uh features that we were kind of talking about uh

592
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
are well all the other features will be part of it but ruin words and things like that will be turning

593
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:06,000
in on friday one thing that we've heard from feedback from players specifically especially as we have

594
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:12,000
addressed this in the past is that there is going to be a boost vendor available for this ptr so in

595
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:18,000
kyovashad players will be able to go and visit this specific vendor this is the best video that i was talking

596
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:24,000
about because this fallen is dancing and it looks it looks absolutely amazing uh this vendor will be

597
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:29,000
available and you'll be able to interact with it and this vendor will actually then be able to provide

598
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:35,000
you a ton of uh enhancements to your character uh which we do have a list of here

599
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:44,000
uh so you will be able to boost your character up to level 50. level 60 of course which is the new

600
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
level cap after vessel of hatred actually ships uh we will end up clearing out your whole map your

601
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:55,000
waypoints uh fog of war uh we will do your class mechanics stuff and have that already unlocked all

602
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,000
torment tears will be unlocked your potions will be on uh upgraded completely and then i know based

603
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,000
off of feedback that we got from like the last ptr was uh hey it'd be great if we could generate like

604
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:11,000
legendary items if we can get all the unique items all the runes that are well that's new now but all the

605
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:16,000
the runes and everything like that including master working materials that will actually be available

606
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:22,000
in this vendor so this is a way for players to be more efficient while testing and being able to give

607
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:30,000
us uh more feedback especially around end game related items uh so we really need players to jump in for

608
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:38,000
ptr one one last caveat i do want to mention is um infernal hordes will not be available in this specific ptr

609
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:43,000
uh we are still doing some work on that right now uh before we actually get it ready but uh all the

610
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:48,000
other features within the game will be available infernal hordes as i mentioned will be it's a

611
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:55,000
permanent feature so it's coming back to the game no matter what uh and then separately um i i do want

612
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:01,000
to remind everyone that ptr right now it is still just pc battle net only this does give us the flexibility

613
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:07,000
of being able to upload change things on the fly like things like turning turning runewords on on friday for

614
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:13,000
instances uh gives us we have the flexibility of being able to do that on on uh our own platform so

615
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:19,000
it's just easier for us to be able to have that uh additional uh work from our side to to be able to

616
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:27,000
make things like that happen when we can do testing specifically from that end um but colin aislaine i'd be

617
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:32,000
really curious to hear like what you guys are looking for specifically in this ptr from feedback from

618
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:37,000
players uh that they can focus in on and provide feedback on uh as they go into the test

619
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:46,000
yeah so i think we really want to see people focusing on the new journey so starting from level

620
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:53,000
one and feeling out what difficulty tier is right for you um and if that feels like it's the difficulty

621
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:58,000
tier that you would expect to be on based on uh how powerful you've managed to make your character

622
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:03,000
and how many of the progression systems you've engaged with like if you engage with tempering

623
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,000
and you go all out and you you know like you're like i'm gonna make my character a blaster even

624
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:13,000
though they're only level 30 like how far can you go with that and are you going as far as you

625
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
expected you would be able to go

626
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,000
yeah those are great points it really is about you know are we hitting that expectation that we've sort

627
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:29,000
of created right which is we really loved how the mine cage was functioning we loved how tormented

628
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:35,000
bosses felt in terms of having hard mode versions of things um are these difficulty tiers sort of

629
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:40,000
meeting those expectations of all the things that we have had in the previous game now mapped to a more

630
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,000
streamlined system that should be much much easier to navigate

631
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:53,000
awesome and i know on the class side like charles what are you kind of looking for what what's the

632
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:58,000
team looking for on that front yeah i think we're really looking at at the new skills and the new

633
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
key passives for each class and and how they're usable at at all points in your character journey

634
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:07,000
right they should feel good to press when you just first learn these new skills um but they should

635
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
also feel really good when you're in the late game and you're trying to you know make you make

636
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:15,000
a build all around them right around your your stone burst like does it feel like that has

637
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:19,000
enough support and that you can you know make a stone burst build or or dance of knives and

638
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:24,000
um or all the other different skills like do they fit in what's their appropriate power level and and

639
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:30,000
really really want to make sure that the new skills and the new key passives uh enable new ways of

640
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:37,000
playing our classes and that and they feel satisfying to build that way awesome and jeevan i know you

641
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:44,000
mentioned to everyone break the game with rune words so wait is there maybe any more extra items

642
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:49,000
you're looking for in terms of feedback yeah i mean it's definitely mostly about that i want to see

643
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:53,000
what people come up with i want to see you know what you can cook in terms of build you can do

644
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:59,000
something fun or cool or unexpected and um also you know i'm highly interested in the sort of balanced

645
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:03,000
feedback i think we'll get it from all of you but um we've had a lot of people on the team work

646
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:08,000
very hard on conceptualizing how to make sure this stuff is right on the edge of broken without

647
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:13,000
actually being broken and you'll get to you'll get to prove me wrong if that isn't the case um yep

648
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:22,000
awesome well i know um we do want to jump into a little bit of q a before we kind of wrap up i know

649
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:28,000
we've been here for a little while so we'll try to grab some questions specifically uh from twitch chat

650
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:37,000
i know uh the probably the most uh popular question right now uh from from the community is about armory and

651
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:43,000
i do want to start off with that specifically and i do also want to just confirm that we are working

652
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:51,000
on an armory it is it the team is cooking on it right now uh we just don't have it ready immediately

653
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:57,000
but as soon as we have an update um we will be providing that uh to the community there is work

654
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:04,000
for an armory happening we're not purposely ignoring it i promise you uh and it it is in the work

655
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:11,000
specifically from that end so um i know uh we we have questions from twitch so this is where i

656
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:16,000
actually like butcher everyone's name so uh in standard fashion i will continue to do that it's

657
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:21,000
just a little different now because i actually like have a a screen in front of me which is actually

658
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:27,000
really really beneficial um but i guess we'll start off with a question regarding uh the different

659
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:33,000
difficulty tiers so this is from double dhz which is uh since we now have eight difficulties does this

660
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:40,000
mean with power increase in later seasons more difficulties will be added wouldn't uh what are

661
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:46,000
we planning on adding uh like 20 difficulties like in diablo 3 like what what's the plans around that

662
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:52,000
yeah we want to be really measured in terms of when we add difficulty tiers

663
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:58,000
um i think it sets us up for adding them when we feel like it's an appropriate time we don't want

664
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:03,000
to get to a spot where we have 20 different difficulty tiers we want to have just enough

665
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:08,000
granularity to support the amount of power that we're adding and what we don't want to do is sort

666
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:13,000
of say okay we're going to add things like runewords or add things like seasonal powers and then nerf all

667
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:19,000
of you by making the monsters 100 tankier to compensate for the power we'd actually rather create a system

668
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
that when you get that new power we're going to add another band of difficulty to get even more

669
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:27,000
efficiency out of that power and so that's been the sort of guiding light is we don't want to

670
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:33,000
continue to sort of nerf players into a spot where they can sort of use all this new power to push

671
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:38,000
a great example of that is previously in seasons we would actually increase monster health to

672
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:44,000
compensate for some of the seasonal powers now if you get seasonal powers if you're blasting penitent

673
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,000
and leveling to 60 faster good for you like that's something that we think is actually

674
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
really important to the system

675
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:58,000
awesome um i know next question that we have this is a question i've seen a a decent amount

676
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:05,000
this is from explosive cat hopefully your cat is not exploding uh what's the purpose of nightmare

677
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:11,000
dungeons now that glyphs have moved out of pit yeah so nightmare dungeons are going to be where

678
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:18,000
you receive your master working materials um and because nightmare dungeons are going to be following

679
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:26,000
the difficulty tier uh system now you're going to be able to go into higher torment tiers or rather higher

680
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:33,000
difficulty tier uh nightmare dungeons and get more uh master materials out of that so just like you know all

681
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:39,000
other kinds of content in the game now being able to go into a higher difficulty of that activity is

682
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:47,000
going to ultimately be better for you yeah the grind sort of putting a grind currency actually fits much

683
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:52,000
better in a nightmare dungeon compared to the pit because it means that every sort of elite you kill

684
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,000
every chest you open or every corner you go into and you find an elite pack those are going to be

685
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:02,000
master working materials as opposed to today where it's like well the instant i make a turn that is not in the

686
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:06,000
in the direction of finishing this dungeon has been a waste of my time because i want that cliff that

687
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:11,000
can play completely changes when everything in the dungeon is dropping master working materials and we

688
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:17,000
think that feels so much better for that type of content um conversely you know with the pit uh you

689
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:21,000
know again we're going to reward you for pushing difficulty and we do want you to sort of get there

690
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:27,000
quickly and get that reward and get out so we think that'll feel a lot better yeah so just just for

691
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
people because i think when they immediately heard like well now it's just moved to nightmare dungeons and

692
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:37,000
it's just at the end it's actually part of of the the the the whole nightmare dungeon it's not

693
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:42,000
just the end goal getting to the end and do and getting you know master working materials there just

694
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:48,000
want to clarify for chat because i know immediately there's a good amount there's a good amount at the

695
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,000
end when you kill the boss right of course the boss has to have good but like what's really

696
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:59,000
going to feel great is like when you run into a massive elite pack like you just randomly run into you know we

697
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,000
spawned maybe too many those are all going to represent you know little loot bags of master

698
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:12,000
working materials which is going to be huge awesome um this question is from rxc 105 um are runes reusable

699
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:21,000
um yeah so um well i just want to say chat i've been reading i've been reading twitch chat and what

700
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:34,000
you've said has uh struck a chord anyway um yes they will be re-even can't take you anywhere um you

701
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:41,000
could unsocket runes and you can uh move them into different items yes absolutely um i saw a few related

702
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:48,000
questions to that uh they they don't get to exist in the same um item as gems you do have to pick between

703
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:58,000
gems and uh runes on any individual item awesome um i know there was a question related to um

704
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:05,000
another well at least oh i don't know i don't know charles you want to answer this or if you have

705
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:10,000
additional details there's a lot of questions related to one of the mythic uniques and it's uh

706
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:18,000
additive damage to demons and angels specifically um i don't know if you want to talk about i will

707
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:26,000
confirm that is the wording on the effect plus damage to angels and demons there you go guys

708
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:34,000
we'll just leave it at that um and no further i know yeah no further comment on that um additional

709
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:41,000
question that we have related to uh paragon is why cap the amount of boards and instead of just

710
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:50,000
capping maybe the amount of lifts we can use this is from hotner yeah that's a really good point um

711
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,000
something that i think we can take back and really think about we had discussed and we felt like the

712
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:02,000
cleanest solution from just sort of the um flow perspective was that we wanted to just make it really

713
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:07,000
sort of compact and make those choices about which glyphs and which legendary nodes and eventually

714
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:12,000
what rare and magic nodes matter to you but that's really good feedback and something we can continue

715
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:17,000
to monitor as we go into ptr and as people get their hands on it again it's really about making

716
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:21,000
those boards more punchy and the connections between those boards is something that you navigate

717
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:26,000
during your journey but the sort of end point is about making those really chunky choices on what

718
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:32,000
glyphs you want and what legendary nodes you want um and we think that ultimately especially now that

719
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:36,000
paragon is realm wide and all your alts i think we touched on that earlier all your alts get to

720
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:41,000
benefit from this um it's really going to streamline that process of getting your points locked in

721
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:47,000
quickly on those alt characters and get them into the end game really quickly um so but that's a really good

722
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,000
point of feedback um a question from

723
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,000
um

724
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
wtf akalaka

725
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:05,000
i see this is this is bad yeah you get the point well everyone need to be in kyobashad to change

726
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
difficulty like it is currently

727
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:16,000
that's a good question we've added actually yeah so um you could imagine how obnoxious it would be to

728
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:21,000
do the pit in karagar and then have to go to kyobashad to then unlock the new torment

729
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:27,000
tier that you just got so we actually added um difficulty tier selectors in karagar as well as

730
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:34,000
kyobashad in addition to kyobashad and then we also have one in krast and there's also another one

731
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:41,000
i think near the dark citadel entrance we've added them in a few locations across the game just to make

732
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
that a little bit of a better experience

733
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:51,000
a question from a few people there's like corintern there's another question from nine tons of pain

734
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,000
uh are lists kind of shared between all characters in the realm or do they have to be leveled up

735
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:55,000
separately

736
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:03,000
um so those are still leveled up separately but that's something like going forward we definitely

737
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:09,000
want an emphasis on like making alts more seamless to play into and we definitely um there's some

738
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:13,000
underlying feedback there which is wouldn't it be great if the paragon lists for account wide and it's

739
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:18,000
like yeah that's something we can take back to the team and philosophically um you know we really

740
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:24,000
want to start moving towards a direction where making alts is really easy to get into and feel

741
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:29,000
powerful um so that's something we can definitely take note of and i'll also highlight that right

742
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:36,000
the because the paragon points are shared account wide or um realm wide as it were um if you make

743
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:40,000
a new character you're going to get a ton of paragon points right away which increases your player

744
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,000
power level which may be means you take on a higher pit tier and then you get the catch-up mechanic

745
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,000
on leveling up those glifts so it is a little bit easier for your alts to level up those glifts as well

746
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:55,000
even if it's not 100 shared yeah that's very true you can level up you can level them up really fast

747
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:02,000
in the pit if you're pushing deep um there is a question regarding eternal realm characters like

748
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:10,000
what happens to them when 2.0 kind of launches what's the like do i'm assuming because they already

749
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:17,000
have like 925 gear if they're at max level they'll be brought down to that to that uh new eye level that we

750
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:23,000
had mentioned is there like any specific changes or anything or is it kind of laid out exactly kind

751
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:36,000
of how we presented oh i can answer this uh yeah yeah um so uh we are doing some adjustments to for

752
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:41,000
those eternal players who really like to play the game on one character we wanted to make sure that

753
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:46,000
there was new loot to chase we also just needed to make sure that with the new character level

754
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:52,000
adjustments um you know we sort of had to adjust the eye power of items now that the fact that the

755
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:57,000
max character level is 60 in addition to our goals of really sort of creating more grounded numbers

756
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:02,000
it does mean level 50 is getting an eye power adjustment as well as the affixes are being adjusted

757
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:09,000
but we are going to max roll every single affix that we adjusted power wise so for example if you get a

758
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:14,000
five we're going to take those items and adjust them uh we aren't going to re-roll those affix bands

759
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:19,000
like if you had perfect affixes um we're just going to essentially max roll all of them within that

760
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:23,000
band so there's no feels bad about you know i had this perfect item and you ruined it by readjusting it

761
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:30,000
but the sort of main takeaway there is we wanted to make sure in patch 2.0 that there was new loot to

762
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:36,000
chase um you know we wanted to make sure that the new uniques had a place to sing um and that that's

763
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:40,000
all sort of in service to that for that type of eternal player who really likes that sort of long

764
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:47,000
form progression awesome uh question from ice pantha rumors are they applicable to all items and

765
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:53,000
weapons are they restricted to specific types of equipment um additionally can gems be inserted into

766
02:29:53,000 --> 02:30:00,000
equipment with runes yeah um there they can be inserted into all types of equipment so they're not

767
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:06,000
restricted from being in uniques as long as you know you have two sockets for that unique and the the

768
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:13,000
to restate the um the slots that are available with two sockets you used it in on base game it's three

769
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:18,000
it's uh chess pants and two-hander we're also adding a second socket to helm so you'll have four slots

770
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:26,000
um and you cannot mix runes with gems in any item and you wouldn't want to you'd basically be losing the

771
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:35,000
benefit of them awesome um i know we have some questions related to like some co-op bugs i i will

772
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:42,000
say that um i've gone on i know like forums and reddit and addressed uh at least address them that we are

773
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:46,000
working on them i can tell you the team is most definitely working on them right now excuse me as i call

774
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:56,000
still getting over my my sickness uh uh and then i know uh this is actually a pretty i'm gonna ask this

775
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:04,000
because it's a funny question are there runes for g and then bun oh i mean my narcissism certainly

776
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:09,000
would have let me do that but i i think i think we can't uh we can't we can't do that sort of stuff

777
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:15,000
unfortunately i would love to but i will say um there are you know the the runes have these sort of

778
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:22,000
phrases that they unlock when you actually compose the spells and we have some i think fun references and

779
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:28,000
easter eggs to you know the great diablo games of the past and um so hopefully that'll kind of

780
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:34,000
make you smile when you see them awesome and then uh runes are they stackable

781
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:42,000
yeah they are stackable and we we have added a new tab for them as well we have a socketable tab

782
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:47,000
so the runes all your runes and gems will go there um so there we go you know would be pretty good for

783
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:54,000
your inventory yeah that it that would have been really messing with inventory if if runes did not

784
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:00,000
stack and now that they have yeah and now they have their own tab which is really really good so

785
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:09,000
um cool i know uh we are going we are very over on time um so i do wanna i do wanna make sure that we

786
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:14,000
um let everyone go here so that they can eat because we've now gone well past lunch over here in

787
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:22,000
