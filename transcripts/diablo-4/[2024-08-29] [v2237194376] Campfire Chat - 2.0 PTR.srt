1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In Vessel of Hatred, we travel south to Nahantu,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
a region with both deep ancient jungles and vast sprawling plains.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's the last stretch of land in Sanctuary's eastern continent,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and we've packed it full of experiences for every type of player.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In this expansion, there's a whole lot to explore under the dark canopy of Nahantu.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Nahantu is the southernmost region of the eastern continent

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that Diablo 4 has been taking place in.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's the last region that we haven't visited yet so far in the game,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
but it is one that we've been to before in Diablo.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There's lots of new areas.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We have six in total.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Four of them are jungle-themed,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and then we have two that are Red Rock Canyon,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but each one of them has their own unique identity.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When you first arrive in Nahantu,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you're in this place called Lingering Hatred.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is high treetops canopies

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
where you're almost walking amongst the branches high above the jungle floor.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Imagine a thick canopy that the light is just barely poking through.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The whole area has been infected by this thing called the hollows infestation.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hollows are a new enemy that's associated with Mephisto.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They themselves are kind of like a tar-like substance creature

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
born straight out of the depths of hell.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It feels a little twisted.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There's a sickness to the area itself.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Humans have ventured into this deep part of the jungle

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
where there's all this poisonous plants and flora.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The dregs actually started experimenting with eating these hallucinogens,

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and it put them into this aggressive psycho rage.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The dregs were pretty fun because we were able to push more variety in the monster family.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You have one of these tall dregs and then half of a body of another dreg on top of it

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
kind of controlling it and telling it where to go and tossing poisonous bombs at the player.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
When you come across it, it's very memorable.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And then we've also got the area of Tenghansi

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
where you've got the Tenghansi Plateau,

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
which is full of these red rocked plateaus and canyons.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Imagine getting up above the land.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Those gigantic walls have pockets inside where monsters could live.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It offered up a lot of opportunity to bring back a monster family like the Lucunai.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We're bringing them back in a new way here as a fully fleshed out monster family with multiple classes.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What a more brute force looks like, what a caster looks like.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They are very much apex predators, and we're definitely in their territory.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And then there's a little sub area called the Skittering Earth.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The name alone makes your skin crawl.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's bug infested, and you can see how the bugs have destroyed the jungles

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and kind of input their influence on it.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Within the Field of Giants, you have these giant corpses of these long dead demons

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
that humans have begun to mine away at for their resources.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
While they've got a lot of use out of them, they're also toxic to the land around it.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The notion of massive demons walking sanctuary a thousand years ago is really thought-provoking.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Plateau's also got just this beautiful color scheme to the lighting.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's really lovely to be there.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And then horrific at the same time. You know, it's great.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The mercenaries in Vessel of Hatred are a group of people who we like to describe

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
as ordinary people with extraordinary skills.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
They have the same level of will to fight against the demons of hell.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And there's four mercs that you can collect over the course of the campaign.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It starts with Rahir, a blacksmith and a shield bearer who's more defensive fighter.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He's able to go in there and soak up damage, use his shield as a bulwark against the enemy.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Meet him early on in the campaign and he's one who introduces you to the mercenary network.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You end up finding acquisition quests for three other mercs that you can find throughout the course of the story.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Subo, the drunken archer, is going to work really well for people who want someone who's out of the main melee,

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
in the back, offering utility and that kind of range support.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Then we have Varyana, a berserker crone who's a melee combat fighter, close range.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You've got a really cool combat meter, a massacre meter where you need to keep killing enemies to get the meter to be filled.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
She's got a bunch of really interesting utility skills that you can kind of build in.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Finally, we have the demon child, Aldkin, who's a magic user who can transform himself from human form to demon form and join you in combat.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's this really great reinforcement ability where you can take one of the mercenary skills and attach it to one of the mercenary skills.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can also use the skill of your powers so that when you use that skill, it calls them in to do a specific skill.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
With the mercenaries for Vessel of Hatred, one of the things we are expanding on is the skill tree.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
For Diablo III, you had a very basic type of mercenary, but this time you can actually push a little bit more into the skill tree

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and make the mercenary the way you would want to play.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Going through each mercenary progression arc and outfitting their skill tree so that it's complementary to your character build,

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I think that's where the fun in the mercenary system really lies.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The Dark Citadel is a new in-game feature that's coming in Vessel of Hatred.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's an entirely cooperative player experience.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All the mechanics within it are based around you working together with your party members to solve the challenges and face the first cars that are hordes within.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
One of the outcomes of the Mage Wars is this giant crater and all the souls that were kind of lost in it from those wars.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The goal of the first Khazrah, who are kind of the original Khazrah, they're using the powers within the Citadel found within this crater to perform experiments to try and bring back their Dark God.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Only recently, people have started going missing. They head into the Khazrah region, they disappear, never to be seen again.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So it's clear that whatever they're planning is about to come to fruition and your job as the player is to get in there and stop it.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Citadel is a place where we take what is the best part of Diablo, combat, and we test it in a different way,

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
which is adding in cooperative mechanics that you have to manage on top of that.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
For example, a boss has an attack, and as a player, you have to collect an item that allows you to reflect the attack back at him.

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So there's a little bit of a twitch level mechanic there where you actually have to time your reaction shot.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What's interesting about it is when you get multiple people in there, we're each responsible for reflecting that shot once,

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
so we all have to sort of master the timing of that move.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can't do that kind of thing without coordinating as a team, and that's sort of the example of what Citadel gameplay feels like.

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
When designing the Citadel, we designed a lot of really cool bosses.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And so one of the things that we did is we took that design and made, like, armor sets for each of the classes.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That way you feel like you took their armor and you feel like you're wearing a little bit of them after your victory.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We also have a currency that's dedicated to Citadel where, as you play through,

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
a vendor can be interacted with to buy custom cosmetics that are unique to the Citadel.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You can play with two people, but the ideal experience is for four.

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In order to facilitate that, we've built an all-new Party Finder feature,

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and the community has been pretty vocal about wanting this for a long time.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It made a lot of sense to us to pair it with this new Citadel mode.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It really is an activity that's geared towards people who love to play together with their friends or with strangers,

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and enjoy that cooperative gameplay.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I cannot wait for players to get into the world.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm really just excited for people to see all the little hidden storytelling elements that the team has fit in.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There's interesting things to find and see and discover around every corner,

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and it's just a really great experience getting to explore Nahantou.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hello, Diablo community. Welcome to another Campfire Chat.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is the Patch 2.0 Campfire Chat for PTR.

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
As you guys can see, we're in a little bit of a new environment.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We're all doing this from home.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We had to do a quick last-minute pivot about 24 hours ago.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I was struck by some con flu after Gamescom,

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
but I just wanted to give a quick shout-out to our production teams behind the scenes.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Lucas, Jaden, Rich, they made a quick pivot to allow us to do this,

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and for us to be safe, and to be able to still give you guys this exciting information for Patch 2.0.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But to lead us off, I do want us to do some quick intros for everyone here on the actual panel.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So, Colin, would you like to start off the intros?

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, sure. I'm Colin on the design team.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hello, I'm Aislinn Hall. I'm a systems designer with a focus on Live Balance.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey, everyone. I'm Charles Dunn. I'm a class designer working on the Live Balance for Diablo 4.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey, everyone. I'm Jeevan Sidhu, and I also work on the systems team.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Awesome. So we got a whole panel here, way more than what we normally have,

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
because we have so much to actually cover.

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We do want to jump into things pretty immediately, but I did want to recap really quickly.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Obviously, last week we were at Gamescom.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We made some really big announcements for Vessel of Hatred, where we announced, you know,

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
the mercenaries that will be coming to Vessel of Hatred,

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
along with how that system works with, like, reinforcements.

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's like a new take of how mercenaries play within Diablo,

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
especially since mercenaries has such a storied history within the franchise itself.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And, of course, we also talked about the Curious Under City and the Dark Citadel,

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
along with the Party Finder feature that players will be able to actually partake in with Vessel of Hatred

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and use that for Dark Citadel and other features within the game.

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We do actually have a blog up on Diablo4.com that does do a good deep dive across all of those specific items,

132
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
so you guys can actually check that out.

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But we have a packed agenda today. This will be a long one, so we hope that everyone will sit down and grab a snack

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and join us as we talk about some pretty large systemic changes that will be coming with Diablo 4,

135
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
along with some new stuff that we'll be sharing as well that will also be coming with Diablo 4.

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So we're going to start off with some progression updates.

137
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We're going to move off into some class and balance changes, along with some quality of life updates,

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and then we'll kind of cap it off with a cool new announcement that will be coming with Vessel of Hatred.

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So, Aislinn, Colin, I know you guys want to jump into some of these big progression changes that you guys were talking about last week,

140
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
so take it away.

141
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, thanks, Adam. And I'm sure everyone has no idea what the big surprise is at the end.

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Not whatsoever.

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So, yeah, yeah, right. So, yeah, let's jump into the progression.

144
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So when we launched the game, we had a sort of vision for the game that we felt like was really fun to play through once,

145
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
where you'd sort of traverse through these world tiers and you'd be gaining new sacred items rarely,

146
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and then you'd be getting ancestral items when hopping into world tier four.

147
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And as we played the game more and more and as we've gotten feedback, that necessarily hasn't really been super fun.

148
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So we've sped up a lot of the progression to sort of get you into that space that where you feel powerful,

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
where you have autonomy of your choice in terms of difficulty and challenge and reward.

150
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Diablo is all about that progression, right, and sort of lasting and feeling efficient.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So we wanted to take a step back after looking at itemization.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We've added a ton of itemization progression that we think is feeling pretty good.

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's a lot of ways to customize your character.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There's a lot of ways to progress your itemization.

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I mean, we wanted to look at other aspects of the game.

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So that came in the form of like what hasn't aged super well?

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What are the things that we really enjoy and we see that you all enjoy and doubling down on that?

158
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So two of those things are difficulty and overall just character progression from your paragons, your glyphs, et cetera.

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We've sort of taken the approach of like really doubling down and embracing again what has been really fun, right?

160
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Blasting, being efficient, having control over your challenge and reward, right?

161
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Profane Mind Cages is awesome when you can stack it to three and you can hop into those hell ties

162
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and just start getting tons of experience and reward for pushing that challenge.

163
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Key dungeons like Nightmare Dungeons, Infernal Hordes, really pretty much every endgame in the system at this point has a tiering system associated with it.

164
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And we think that's like pretty indicative of like what has been fun and we want to embrace that.

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And part of that is, you know, that the idea of I can push really hard to get more efficiency.

166
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Part of that's conquering milestones, right?

167
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's really good.

168
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's a ton of fun to hop into World Tier 3 early.

169
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think I hopped in at level 25 in the latest release just to see if I could do it.

170
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And it was a ton of fun.

171
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And it's sort of all about embracing that gaining power in multiple ways, feeling super powerful.

172
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And then another thing that we really wanted to look at in terms of making this better is alting.

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We made a change to make it so that the mythic uniques could be equipped at level 35.

174
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And if you've done that, it's a really badass experience where, you know, roll a barbarian, slap a grandfather on them, and you just blast through the leveling experience and it's a ton of fun.

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That being said, we've added tons of sort of power to the equation.

176
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And we wanted to make sure that we also gave you more autonomy to sort of challenge yourself with all that new power.

177
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And we're adding a ton of new power in the expansion as well.

178
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So to cover it again, right, we want to look at expanding the progression in other areas of the game come patch 2.0.

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So with that, Aislin actually has a bunch of exciting changes to talk about here.

180
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I do.

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you, Colin.

182
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay, everyone, I want you to put on your thinking caps because we have a lot of details to cover.

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So buckle up.

184
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We, in fact, have a topic screen here because there's so many things regarding progression that we're going to be talking about today.

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So the way that we're approaching this presentation is we're basically going to be bringing you through what a character's journey would actually look like.

186
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You know, starting by talking about the character journey and then talking about some difficulty.

187
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Uh, tier changes that are coming and then going deeper into, you know, how you're going to be gaining.

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Um, more rewards from those sad difficulty tears.

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Um, so yeah, without further ado, let's simply jump in and get started with the character journey.

190
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay, so some changes coming to how you're going to be leveling up.

191
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Um, there's going to be a level adjustment.

192
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So we're going to be getting started with the character level.

193
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
First of all, uh, coming to patch 2.0 right now in the live game, you know, you go from character level one to 50.

194
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Those are your skill point levels.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And then every level after 50 is a paragon level where you're earning four paragon points per paragon level.

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We're going to be splitting those out in patch 2.0.

197
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Um, and so you're going to earn paragon points, which are, which are going to be separate from your character level.

198
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Uh, levels one to 50 represent those character levels.

199
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And there's also going to be a new max character level, quote unquote, of level 60.

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And that means that you are going to be earning 10 more, uh, skill points, uh, from what you had been earning, uh, pre patch 2.0.

201
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There's also going to be a re-imagined pace to the leveling journey.

202
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So we have a lot new, a lot of new difficulty tiers that are being added to the game more on that soon.

203
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Uh, but effectively, um, lower difficulty tiers are going to be offering you a slower pace.

204
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
If you're a near player, you just want a very casual, chill experience, but you're going to be able to bump it up if you want to.

205
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Like if you're, you know, engaging with tempering, you're engaging with all these systems that are making your character stronger and you want something to test that against.

206
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We are aiming to give that to you.

207
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Uh, and these, uh, difficulty tiers are going to be offering you, uh, improved efficiency, improved rewards.

208
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And the goal is to improve your pace.

209
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If you can blast through these difficulties.

210
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah.

211
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Now there's the mind cages, right?

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Like we, we sort of heard, yeah, we, you heard, we heard you like mind cages.

213
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So we put it in the game systemically, like from whispers to hell tide to literally everything.

214
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
In the world, like maybe like doing dungeons.

215
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Um, and really it's starting, it's sort of like giving players that choice to do what they want.

216
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And it's not just hell tide now that can push that difficulty.

217
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, totally.

218
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Like we were just playing on the development team and we were playing in hell tides and, you know, playing with mind cages and we were like, this is great.

219
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like, I want to just be able to do this or like have this option available to me, like basically whenever I'm playing.

220
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Uh, so that's a big part of these changes.

221
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Uh, moving on here to the number adjustments.

222
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So as a lot of you guys found in footage, yes, there is a, a pretty substantial number adjustment.

223
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Um, so a big part of this is we want to make sure that there's room for growth and we're adding a lot of player power in patch 2.0 and vessel of hatred.

224
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Um, and we want to make sure that numbers don't get so crazy that we cannot even fathom them.

225
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Right.

226
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Um, and so a big part of this is, uh, giving us a good starting points in patch 2.0 where we can afford to grow numbers.

227
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Um, so yeah.

228
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah.

229
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah.

230
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think it's really important, you know, to have numbers that are like, uh, when you're like doing damage numbers to, to see ones that are meaningful to you.

231
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Right.

232
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Uh, if you're increasing your damage, like even 10 X, but it's taken it from like an eight or nine digit number to a 10 digit number, it's, it's almost impossible to see that kind of growth in player power.

233
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So with, with numbers that are more readable on screen, uh, that, that a makes it much more obvious when you're getting more powerful and just makes the game as a whole easier to kind of comprehend.

234
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Totally.

235
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah.

236
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And it's important to note that like, this is relative, um, in that we're not slowing you down in any way.

237
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This is purely sort of one of those adjustments that we're making to ensure that you can have more growth in the end game.

238
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
We're not at the top end nerfing things like crit chance or CDR.

239
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Um, really this is all about having actually like sort of what we set out to do when we launched the game is have more grounded numbers for longer.

240
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's not to say that you aren't going to get insane in the deep end game.

241
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Right.

242
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah.

243
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah.

244
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah.

245
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah.

246
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You're still going to have a lot of power to game.

247
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Um, and yeah, finally, uh, just going back to this first bullet here on this slide, we're going to talk more about Paragon later, but for now we're going to focus on some other things.

248
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So sit tight.

249
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Okay.

250
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay.

251
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Let's talk about how monsters are changing.

252
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So we've streamlined monster health and damage in a pretty big way.

253
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We took a look at how monsters gain health and how they gain damage over, uh, different difficulty tiers.

254
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Uh, and we've really like honed in and, and kind of universalized our approach to how they're, uh, gaining power throughout your character experience.

255
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Uh, and this is going to be applying to all monster types, you know, normal monsters, minions, which are elites, little buddies, uh, elites themselves.

256
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And of course bosses and all of these monsters now have health that's relative to their normal monster counterpart on any given like difficulty tier.

257
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Uh, and what this does is it really helps smooth, uh, difficulty progression and the difficulty of any experience that you're currently in.

258
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Secondly, we have some changes to, uh, monster scaling.

259
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So monsters are going to scale to a pit tier and we're going to talk more about that as well, pretty soon too.

260
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Uh, so sit tight.

261
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And the big thing here is that monsters are always going to match the player level now.

262
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So on live, we have a world where monsters can be, you know, a hundred levels offset of you and anywhere in between.

263
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And that can be fairly hard to understand.

264
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Um, and so a big part of this pass is kind of removing that elements of the game so that we can focus on what difficulty we're currently in and using that as the judge of how hard or how easy or wherever in between, uh, the content you're currently is, uh, you're currently in is.

265
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And finally, we have some pretty cool combat tuning changes.

266
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Uh, so we've taken a lot of looks at, you know, like the, the moment to moment combat pacing in the game, uh, and monster mechanics across the board have been adjusted to really hone in on player momentum.

267
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You know, you're here to slaughter demons.

268
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
We want you to move quickly, uh, through the game.

269
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And we don't necessarily want monsters to be slowing you down, especially normal monsters.

270
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Um, and to achieve this, uh, you know, we've reduced instances of getting one shot, like out of nowhere.

271
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And we've also adjusted boss HP, um, so that they're not quite as grindy after you're moving in from, you know, after blasting down AOE packs in the pit, for example.

272
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, it was definitely a pain point.

273
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, great.

274
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Oh, go ahead, Charles.

275
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Uh, um, yeah, I, I, I just saying, right.

276
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's always been the pain point in the pit so far is like, Hey, you're really strong.

277
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You blast through most of the dungeon and then you get up to the boss and the boss takes, you know, five minutes or more.

278
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's just like such a slog.

279
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Uh, so, so we're definitely making sure it's a more consistent experience, uh, in a given difficulty tier, you're, you're going to have a more consistent experience across boss and other portions of the game.

280
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah.

281
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And we've already taken a lot of steps towards this.

282
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Um, and, and pre the, one of the previous seasons, we set it so that you wouldn't get, um, armor cap penalties as the monster is leveled higher than you.

283
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Right.

284
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So this is really just sort of consolidating a lot of the, um, I'm going to get shit for the blizzard math, um, on the back end to make sure that like a lot of the things are really, um, being reworked on the back end to address the problems we see on live with the crazy exponential scaling of boss health from like four different levels.

285
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
different multipliers and the crazy exponential damage that some of the monsters are getting.

286
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If like the, ah, yes, the corpse bow, of course, um, dying in one shot from off screen.

287
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,000
A lot of those things should be much more consistent as you're climbing through those difficulty tiers, which we're going to talk more about in the, in the future or in this presentation.

288
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Very soon.

289
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
In fact, like right now, difficulty.

290
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Difficulty tiers.

291
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Like right now.

292
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Let's talk about it.

293
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So, this is our beautiful, uh, blizzard illustration, if you will, uh, of current day.

294
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Art by Colin.

295
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Art by Colin.

296
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Thank you very much.

297
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I gotta call out Colin.

298
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah.

299
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh no.

300
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We've got the.

301
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We're gonna get art for this.

302
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
This is art.

303
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What are you talking about?

304
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah, this is beautiful.

305
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
This is beautiful.

306
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Modern art.

307
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Uh, yeah, you can see we have the big bone boss.

308
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Very, very sad at the current state of things up there.

309
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Um, so what this is basically illustrating is that there are basically brackets right now on live where various content is relevant.

310
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You have world bosses that stay relevant for a certain amount of time.

311
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You have hell tide that stays relevant, you know, maybe a little bit longer than world bosses do.

312
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And then you have world tiers one and two.

313
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Then you have world tier three, which is, you know, very sad.

314
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Sorry, world tier three.

315
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah.

316
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Uh, and then world tier four.

317
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll have a magnifying glass.

318
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You can see it.

319
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah.

320
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah.

321
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Maybe if you look really closely, you can see how long it takes to go through world tier three.

322
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Um, and then world tier four, which has like a bit of a tail, but still pretty short.

323
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And then we compare it to like where our characters power currently exists, which is, you know, you've got level one to 100.

324
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And then of course your journey throughout all of the pit tiers.

325
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And basically what this is illustrating is a lot of these content types fall off.

326
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
World bosses don't stay relevant forever.

327
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Helltide doesn't stay relevant forever.

328
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The world tiers you're living on in the open world don't stay relevant.

329
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Um, and eventually it simply becomes about running the pit.

330
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And that's the place where you can judge your character strength.

331
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
We don't necessarily want the game to work that way.

332
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
We want a lot of activities to stay fun and interesting and engaging for as long as possible.

333
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And so to accomplish that, we've got some pretty big changes coming to difficulty tiers.

334
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So let's dive into the meat and potatoes of this talking about pit arbitration.

335
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And that's just a fancy way of basically saying that the pit is going to be something behind the scenes that's setting the pace of all difficulty in the game across all content types.

336
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So pit tiers are going to match difficulty tiers.

337
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:19,000
There's going to be five pit tiers per standard difficulty, which is just encapsulating, um, four new world tiers pre level 60, which are normal, hard, expert and penitent.

338
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Uh, and then there will be 15 pit tiers per torment difficulty, and they're going to be four torment difficulty tiers.

339
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:37,000
One, two, three, and four difficulty tiers are going to derive monster health damage and intensity from the pit tier that is associated with that difficulty tier.

340
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And I know that's a little complicated, but we're going to have some, uh, some supporting stuff to, to show what this means a little better, uh, pretty soon.

341
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And I do want to call out intensity here.

342
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Colin, do you want to talk about monster intensity raising between difficulty tiers?

343
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah.

344
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So intensity is something we played around with in the base game and it's sprinkled out throughout, throughout the game.

345
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Um, but when, what intensity is, is it's a backend system that controls, uh, monster aggressiveness as well as monster intelligence.

346
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So by aggressiveness, it's things like they attack faster, they have lower cooldowns, um, they move faster.

347
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And then intelligence is they predict your movement more.

348
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
They'll face you more.

349
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So if you, you know, it has a big swing, it's actually going to try and track you a little bit more accurately.

350
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Um, so it's not just the health and damage that's going up through these difficulty tiers.

351
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The monsters are actually becoming a little bit more dynamic and fast paced.

352
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Um, and we think that feels pretty good.

353
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Um, especially when it's sort of scaling through the new difficulty series system that we have.

354
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah.

355
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,000
This is something we currently, we do have on, on the live game, but you know, in the new, um, patch 2.0, you're really going to feel that difference.

356
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Currently you feel a little bit of difference in between the different world tiers, and that's just going to be magnified.

357
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And your moment to moment combat is, it's not just going to be higher numbers.

358
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The moment to moment will feel different and harder at these higher torment difficulties.

359
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yep.

360
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
They're going to become bigger jerks as you ascend difficulties.

361
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
All right.

362
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So let's talk about difficulty gating.

363
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So this is basically how people are going to be moving through these different difficulty tiers.

364
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So the pit is going to unlock, uh, once you hit character level 60, which is the new max.

365
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So the maximum character level in patch 2.0.

366
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So pit tiers associated with, uh, standard difficulties are going to unlock immediately, which is pit tiers one through 20.

367
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You're going to be able to challenge all of those immediately once your max level.

368
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And you're going to need to beat pit tier 20 to unlock the first torment tier.

369
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Once you beat pit tier 20, you're allowed to go into the overworld on torment one.

370
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And then as we see here, there are 15 pit tiers per torment difficulties.

371
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So to unlock torment two, you would then need to progress through the pit and beat pit tier 35, at which point you can now go into torment two in all other activities.

372
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So on and so forth.

373
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So this is basically creating a sorry.

374
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Go ahead.

375
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Go on.

376
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Oh, I was going to jump in and say like, what's kind of interesting is like torment one.

377
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You can think about as world tier three today.

378
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Um, and what we're sort of doing is essentially saying now that level cap is 60, um, you actually can find some of the best items in the game very early.

379
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Right.

380
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Imagine if you were able to just start finding the best items in the game in world tier three.

381
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Um, that's really sort of what we're talking about here.

382
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We're really speeding up when you can actually get to the end game where we've added things like the pit.

383
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
We've added things like, um, nightmare dungeons and more end game activities for you to engage with an item modification system.

384
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So, uh, it really is sort of getting you into the fun faster, which also makes ulting a lot more cool.

385
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Right.

386
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's way easier to sort of get to that point where, all right, I'm in the end game.

387
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm going to start looking for awesome items.

388
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm going to start modifying my items.

389
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Um, so we think that that like sort of, um, represents a pretty substantial change to how you play the game.

390
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Oh yeah.

391
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
For us wondering why we kind of built it around the pit, you know, and why we associated difficulty with the pit.

392
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
How do y'all think about that?

393
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah.

394
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So right now the pit is a fantastic razor to judge your character against.

395
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Um, and I think that this overhaul is effectively turning the pit into the game's backbone to use kind of a gruesome term, but you know, we're Diablo, so whatever.

396
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Um, it's basically turning the pit into the game's backbone of like difficulty, uh, and all other difficulties kind of derived from that.

397
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Um, and it gives us a very predictable and understandable pace for you to experience all other activities in the game, uh, based on the pit's difficulty.

398
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Um, and that, that razor is great for pushing difficulty.

399
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Right.

400
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You think about how, um, part of what's really fun again about Diablo is that feeling of progression and that feeling of becoming powerful, then taking on a big ass demon, killing it, getting awesome loot.

401
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And what the pit is going to do is you're going to push that difficulty, then unlock new torment tiers, which is going to unlock more efficiency for you.

402
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Um, and you can sort of think about it as like, we've added not just a world tier five, but a world tier five and six, um, as part of this torment system.

403
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And it's something we can continue to sort of evaluate and build on as characters become more powerful.

404
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And we add new ways to sort of play through the system.

405
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah.

406
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And I think it's also a lot about consistency across content, right?

407
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Currently in the live game, we've got a lot of different, um, you know, levels of different types of things, right?

408
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You've got nightmare dungeon keys, you've got pit levels, you've got infernal horde of tears.

409
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Um, and we just kind of realized that, Hey, the pit is something that we have, you know, really good, um, delineation between the different levels.

410
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So you've got a widespread of, of, um, you know, different tiers for that.

411
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And that's something we can kind of peg difficulty against across the whole game to make a more consistent experience.

412
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
When you're in a certain difficulty tier, you're just going to get a more consistent experience across all activities.

413
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Right.

414
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah.

415
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah.

416
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So like when you're on tournament two, you're going to know that all content you're facing is on the level of torment two.

417
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But right now on the live game, you know, you have a, you go into a pit tier 50 and you're like, okay, it's pit tier 50 difficulty.

418
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And then you go into a nightmare dungeon tier 50 and it's a totally different difficulty.

419
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And then you go into an infernal hordes tier eight and you're like, wait a minute, this is extremely hard compared to these other ones.

420
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
They're just not similar.

421
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Right.

422
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And so we want to create a more level playing field, uh, so that difficulty is easier to understand.

423
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's also like a common language and shared experience for everyone.

424
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, that's definitely a benefit.

425
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And it's also, um, in some sense, leveling up all the activities.

426
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Like I know that there's some people who really enjoy whispers, for example, and whispers just falls off.

427
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Like if you're doing the pit and you're level 100, you're level 90 in the pit, like whispers are terrible, right?

428
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Like you're not actually going to run whispers, um, when you're pushing that deep into the game.

429
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But now when sort of things are leveling up with torment tiers, you have a place to go and sort of juice the efficiency from those different activities.

430
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
If you like that activity.

431
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah.

432
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And this, this kind of carries over to other activities, not just whispers.

433
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's like, you know, your hell tides.

434
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah, the whole world is leveling.

435
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Right.

436
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah.

437
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Like it's, which is another thing like Infernal Hordes is something that obviously was introduced in season five is coming back and is a permanent feature within the game and is also going up with the rest of the content.

438
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yep.

439
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
All right.

440
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So let's talk a little more about the details of difficulty tiers.

441
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So on the right hand side here, you can see this table.

442
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
It's basically showing off, um, the associated pit tier with any given difficulty tier.

443
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So normal simply starts on one.

444
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And then like we saw before, it goes up by five each time until you get to torment tiers, at which point it goes up by 15 each time.

445
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So torment four lands on 65.

446
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Torment one starts on 20.

447
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Um, and in, in light of this, uh, we have changed the height of the target.

448
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
We have changed the highest pit tier to be 100 down from 200.

449
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Um, and this doesn't mean that the pit tier 100 is going to be the same difficulty as it is on live.

450
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's going to be harder.

451
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Um, so each pit tier you're, you're going up is going to be harder than it was before effectively.

452
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And we also have this pretty neat new system where we have smart keys.

453
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Um, and what that means is your things like infernal hordes or nightmare dungeons, the keys to enter those activities are now going to follow, uh, the current difficulty tier that you're on.

454
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So if I have an infernal horde key and I'm on torment three and I use it, I'm going to go into a torment three difficulty infernal horde.

455
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And the same is true for nightmare dungeons.

456
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Um, so we're pretty excited about that change because again, you know, coming back to all these things we've, we've talked about where it just kind of makes things easier.

457
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Just makes life easier.

458
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah.

459
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's a big quality of life change because on live right now you get a bunch of sacred, um, you know, nightmare dungeon keys.

460
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And I'm sure everyone runs a ton of world tier three nightmare dungeons, right?

461
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Um, you definitely don't just pop in to get a sacred weapon, but, um, what, what I'm getting at is a lot of those keys just end up getting salvaged.

462
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And now when all keys can sort of carry weight through various torment tiers, um, getting a nightmare key is this interesting choice of like, well, do I keep it or do I run it now?

463
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Because if I keep it, I can just use it at a later time.

464
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And it's really about giving player, uh, the players that choice on when do they want to run this content?

465
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
We're not just going to invalidate that key and say, oh, and torment two, you need to find a new key to do this thing.

466
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Um, so I think it's definitely making key management a lot easier and more fluid as well.

467
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Um, and one thing on the pit, Aislinn that I think is really interesting is, uh, we definitely have rescaled the pit, uh, tier 100 is sort of like our 200 on live.

468
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Um, but I think that's something that, uh, you know, we, we definitely want to keep an eye out on PTR.

469
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
We don't have any problems with increasing the amount of pit tiers.

470
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Like this is something we can definitely revisit if we see in PTR that you're all are, are insane, which is something we can definitely revisit.

471
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
We really like that. It's a razor and measuring stick, and we don't want to take that away from players.

472
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So, um, that's something that we want to get PTR feedback and we could really use your help in breaking that system and seeing how far you can push it.

473
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh yeah, that's a great point. And, you know, like we've said on this stream, there are going to be a lot of new player power opportunities coming.

474
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And so, yeah, please show us what you got, as they say.

475
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Okay, so let's talk about, uh, let's just dive a little more into the details.

476
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Uh, I think we went over a lot of this stuff already.

477
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Uh, but we can kind of go through this slide here.

478
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Um, so yeah, all content in the game exists within an expanded difficulty tier selection.

479
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Like we were talking about, um, I think an important thing to call it here is that, for example, penitent, um, is if you're comparing it just to like kind of understand what it's going to look like relative to live right now.

480
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Uh, penitent's kind of going to end up being like world tier two, if you added 45 monster levels on top of it.

481
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And that's intended to kind of be the upper echelon of like pre max level, um, character leveling.

482
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So if you really want to amp up the difficulty to as hard as you can make it, like going on dependent is, is where you want to be.

483
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Uh, and this is just a lovely little visual aid.

484
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We've got some cool new icons for these, uh, difficulty tiers.

485
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Um, normal, hard expert and penitent.

486
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
It gets harder as you keep going.

487
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Um, okay.

488
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So yeah.

489
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And we really want this to be like opt in not progression locked.

490
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Um, and so the vanilla Diablo four difficulty tiers kind of operated as progression tiers.

491
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Right.

492
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And what I mean by progression tiers is the moment you get to world tier three, as Colin was saying,

493
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
like you unlock sacred items.

494
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Maybe you go into a dungeon so you can find a sacred weapon and these things unlock so quickly and they drop so frequently that you kind of just got this huge burst of power and you never really got to feel that power.

495
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Um, and we want to make sure that you are like feeling each upgrade you get in the game and it feels really, really punchy.

496
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Uh, and we really want these new difficulty tiers to be player guided.

497
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Like we want you to be able to make your own decisions on when you're moving on to the next one and what's the right pace for you.

498
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And of course these new difficulty tiers are going to give you, uh, improving rewards.

499
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You're going to find more gold, more experience, and you're going to have more loot efficiency per difficulty tier.

500
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So the higher difficulty tier you can fight the game on, the more efficient your experience is going to be effectively.

501
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah.

502
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I think that's really good.

503
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Go ahead, Charles.

504
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Go ahead, Kyle.

505
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah.

506
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I just say that's really like what I view is the differentiating factor between, you know, what current B4 is and, and in the new patch 2.0 is you, if you enter torment one, you can find the best item in torment one.

507
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You could complete your character and get full best in slot and everything.

508
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's just going to take a while, right?

509
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It's going to be less efficient.

510
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You're going to be getting less loot.

511
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And as, whereas in, in the live game right now, right, you just can't find the best things in world tier three.

512
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You, you are kind of obligated to go to that world tier four.

513
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And now if you're able to clear higher torments with efficiency, that's just going to be the best option for you to find the gear more efficiently, but you aren't forced into torment four to find the best items in the game.

514
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah.

515
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,000
That's something I've really liked about it is that, you know, you, we get to start the end game a lot earlier with torment, right?

516
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Because there's, there's nothing that you're excluded from.

517
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
There's no awesome piece of loot that you can't find by torment one.

518
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And so you get to, you get to really start to test your build after it's, it's kind of gotten some real optimization.

519
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I think much earlier into the journey than before.

520
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yeah.

521
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I couldn't agree more Jeevan.

522
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And like a great example of that is what we're doing with the ladder bosses or the lair bosses.

523
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
All of those unlock in torment one, the cost to summon them is static.

524
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It remains the same throughout all the torment tiers.

525
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And what that means is if you can beat it on a higher torment tier, you're going to get way more uniques.

526
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So you get a handful of unique starting in torment one, way more uniques and obviously torment four, but the cost, because it remains static, we're not going to ask you to get anything extra like a city and stone.

527
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That just means as long as you can kill that torment four boss, you're getting way more efficiency out of the boss.

528
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I mean, it really is like this.

529
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It feels amazing to sort of progress through those torment tiers and just unlock way more power opportunity.

530
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah, we don't really have this differentiation of like a regular version of the late game boss, like a regular version of Durial and then the tormented echo of Durial.

531
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That's not really a distinction that we have anymore.

532
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Whereas like previously it would cost, you know, more materials to summon the tormented version, but it would give more rewards.

533
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Now it's the same cost across the different torment tiers.

534
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's just if you're able to conquer him on torment four, that's where you're going to get the absolute most bang for your buck in terms of resources in to loot out.

535
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah, and I want to just double down on like torment one is where the end game starts now and just each torment here that you're ascending is making your end game, you know, more fun, basically, because you're going to be getting cooler stuff or more frequently.

536
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Okay, so enough about difficulty tiers. Let's move on to some itemization changes.

537
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So item strength, we have what I like to call the item power shuffle happening in patch 2.0 items with item power above five 540 are going to be adjusted to 540.

538
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And I fixed bands in lieu of this, or in addition to this rather, are going to be adjusted as well.

539
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So yeah, items at the new character level max are going to, they're going to max out at 750.

540
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And that's not actually the highest item power that's going to be in the game.

541
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And we'll talk about that more in just a second.

542
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But most items you're going to be finding once you hit max character level will be item power 750.

543
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And you're going to be finding much better item power items from levels 51 to 59.

544
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
There's going to be big item power jumps.

545
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So once you start leveling your character past those original 50 character levels, you're going to start finding a lot better gear.

546
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Okay, so let's take a look at what an ancestral item looks like in patch 2.0.

547
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, could we? Yeah, let's, let's take a look here real quick.

548
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So you'll notice here that this item has 800 item power, which is 50 higher than the max 750 that I was talking about before.

549
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You'll also notice on the right hand side that that is the torment icon.

550
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So ancestral items can be found starting on torment one.

551
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:47,000
They're going to become more frequent as you ascend torment difficulties, but they're still going to stay pretty rare throughout all torment levels.

552
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
You'll also notice that the greater a fix on this item is highlighted.

553
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
That is because now whenever you find an ancestral item, they're always going to have one greater a fix.

554
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
They can roll with more, but they will be guaranteed a single one every single time.

555
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So let's dive in more into the details.

556
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Right. Aislinn is part of finding a greater a fix on live right now is sometimes it's on life per second.

557
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That's like, oh, okay. Got a greater a fix on life per second.

558
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
But now when you see an ancestral item, it's always going to have a greater a fix.

559
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And that ancestral I power bump, the a fix bump is going to feel really good.

560
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Even if you miss that a fix, it's still a huge upgrade to your character if you haven't found one of these before.

561
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah. And sometimes, right, you get an item that has multiple greater a fix is on live and it's, you know, it's not at 925.

562
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's not at the highest item power. And that that's kind of a mixed bag, right?

563
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Like, well, it's kind of good, but it's, you know, a lower lower item power.

564
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And now things with greater a fix is will be definitionally at that highest highest item power.

565
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Yes.

566
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Okay. So let's talk about the details here.

567
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So sacred items are not going to drop anymore.

568
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
They're kaput.

569
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You're going to be looking at normal items pre-torments, and then you're going to be chasing ancestral items once you are in torment tiers.

570
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So, yeah, starting in torment one, they're going to start to drop.

571
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
As I said, they're going to become more common as you go up.

572
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But again, they're going to stay fairly rare.

573
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
They're never going to, you know, be like the only thing that's dropping.

574
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Ancestral items are intended to be where you're finding forever items.

575
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So when you find like a really good ancestral weapon or, you know, of whatever slot that you may not have an ancestral item for, that's going to be a big moment.

576
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
That's going to be an exciting moment where you're going to get something a lot better because they also have their own affix band as well.

577
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So these ancestral items are going to have better affixes than their non ancestral counterparts to something to note is that greater affixes only drop on ancestral items.

578
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You're not going to be finding greater affixes on non ancestral.

579
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
So when you see a greater affix drop on the ground, you're going to know that that is an ancestral item.

580
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Ancestral items also have two tempering slots up from one on non ancestral and they're masterworkable up to 12, whereas non ancestral are masterworkable up to four.

581
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And finally, they are going to have higher aspect ranks, too.

582
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So you're going to find legendary aspects that become better on ancestral items.

583
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And Charles, we actually added a ton of power to legendary aspects to accommodate this.

584
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We didn't just sort of readjust where those those power bands are coming from.

585
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, all of the legendary aspects that now scale a little bit further into the ancestral tier.

586
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
We basically just tacked on five new levels kind of on top of the current value.

587
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So you're just going to find even more powerful legendary effects than you have currently in the new ancestral tier.

588
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It's going to be a lot of fun to find those.

589
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
OK, let's move on to Paragon.

590
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Paragon.

591
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So we have some pretty big glyph updates coming with patch 2.0.

592
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:25,000
There's been a significant rework to how many ranks you can earn on any given glyph from 21 to 100, which is a lot of new ranks.

593
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But we want to make sure that there's still texture in that system.

594
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Right.

595
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And so because of that, we also have a new legend rather a new glyph rarity legendary.

596
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So once you upgrade a glyph to rank 46, it becomes a legendary glyph, which you can see here on the right.

597
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
This spirit glyph is level 50.

598
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So it's past that 46 mark.

599
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It's legendary.

600
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
You're going to get a glyph radius increase at rank 15, which is already in the live game.

601
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But you're also going to get another radius increase at rank 46 when it becomes legendary.

602
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And this is making them bigger than they could have been previously.

603
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So you're going to get more space with your glyphs because of this.

604
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And when a glyph becomes legendary, it also unlocks a significant bonus more so than it did before.

605
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And you can see that on the bottom of this glyph here.

606
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It's got the legendary bonus increases critical strike damage by 21.6%.

607
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And it's very important to note that this is a multiplicative bonus.

608
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
This 21.6% is not an additive bonus.

609
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So you're going to be getting a lot of power from that bonus there.

610
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Something else I want to bring up is that glyphs are moving to the pit.

611
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So you're going to be upgrading your glyphs in the pit.

612
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You're no longer going to be upgrading them in nightmare dungeons.

613
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And it's going to be an attempt based system.

614
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So when you finish a pit run, you're going to go to the end and you're going to be able to have some chances to level up your glyph.

615
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
And increase their ranks.

616
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And if you are in a pit that is 10 tiers higher than your current glyph, you're going to have guaranteed success.

617
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And for every 20 pit tiers that the pit level you're in is higher than your current glyph that you're trying to upgrade, you're going to get bonus ranks so that you can accelerate the process.

618
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Do you want to speak more to that, Colin?

619
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah, I think this is a really important note because you could easily look at the rank 100 and be like, oh, my God, the grind is even longer.

620
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But based on how that upgrade chance works, it's guaranteed as long as you're beating pit tiers that are higher than your glyph.

621
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And then how that bonus map ends up playing out is if you're beating, for example, a pit tier 30, that's roughly somewhere between today's world tier three and four.

622
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You can upgrade a glyph from one to 15 and three runs.

623
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So you think about the difference between today's game and patch 2.0, you're getting those glyphs leveled way faster if you're pushing that difficulty.

624
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:09,000
And what we really wanted to do here was we've heard a ton of feedback around how the XP system for Nightmare Dungeons feels really grindy.

625
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
It also just doesn't serve the Nightmare Dungeons very well.

626
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Right. It's like, how do I get to the end as fast as possible, but nothing in the dungeon matters.

627
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Right. And that what that does is in the pit, it's all about speed and efficiency, and it sort of embraces that.

628
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And we think that that's just really going to accelerate your pit glyph upgrading speed and the chance you could sort of want to be really clear with the chance.

629
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
The chance based system is essentially there because it felt really bad when it was binary.

630
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Like when we said, hey, you need to beat the pit tier or you need to beat a pit that's 10 levels higher than your glyph.

631
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And if you don't, you get nothing that just felt really bad.

632
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So the chance is not there to increase the grind or slow down progression.

633
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It's actually just there to protect from like it feeling just terrible to not get literally anything from that run.

634
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So again, to be clear, it's 100% chance as long as you're pushing difficulty.

635
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We think that this fits the content a lot better.

636
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,000
We've heard a ton of feedback around like the pit rewards feeling lackluster, and there's not really a reason to push difficulty.

637
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You know, you sort of just want to hone in on like 90 or 101, depending on where you're at in terms of your progression journey on live.

638
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
This system really encourages you to push and gives you a tangible reward every single time you do it.

639
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah.

640
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And I think it's important that there's the consistency of like the communication between right.

641
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So, hey, my glyphs are currently level 50.

642
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Well, what kind of pit tier should I be approaching to upgrade these?

643
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Well, somewhere in the range of 50 to 60, right?

644
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
You're just a little bit higher so that you can keep pushing that harder content.

645
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And also, if you have a glyph down at level one, because maybe you haven't paid attention to that glyph, it's going to level up much faster if you are already you already proven yourself proven that you can hang in and pit to your 50, for instance, you're going to level those up very quickly.

646
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I think that's also cool is if you have a build that you feel isn't doing as well as you go up in torment, it makes it a lot easier to kind of snap something back in and catch up faster.

647
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah, absolutely.

648
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah, the further you progress, the easier it is to to level those up.

649
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So here we have a video basically just showing off what the new UI looks like for upgrading a glyph in patch 2.0.

650
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So you can see that it's showing you the current pit level you're on, the current success chance to get a rank up.

651
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And something else I want to call out is that when you are.

652
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Oh, yes. Right.

653
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So this is rank 45 to 46 explicitly, which is the moment where you are increasing a glyph from rare to legendary.

654
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And something important to note about that is that it does cost a fairly significant amount of gym fragments as well.

655
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But it's giving you that increased radius size and the new multiplicative legendary bonus, which is pretty sick.

656
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And here we have an example of showing how the radius gets even bigger in patch 2.0.

657
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I want to call out here that the midpoint says level 21.

658
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That is not correct.

659
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It is level 15 where the radius increases.

660
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But yeah, previously there were only there was only one radius increase.

661
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Now with legendary glyphs at rank 46, there is a second radius increase.

662
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
OK, so let's talk about some more stuff related to Paragon.

663
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
We have realm partitioning for Paragon now.

664
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And this is kind of getting into all things that Colin was talking about.

665
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
We have realm based Paragon points now.

666
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So your Paragon points are going to be shared across an entire realm.

667
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And remember that what a realm is, is like either seasonal soft core or seasonal hardcore or the same for eternal.

668
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Those are realms.

669
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And these Paragon points are going to stay latent on a pre level 60 character.

670
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And what that means is that, you know, if you have, let's say, 150 Paragon points on a realm,

671
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
those Paragon points will remain inactive on any character that's pre level 60.

672
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But once you hit level 60 on that character, they will have those 150 Paragon points.

673
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And it's also important to note that any Paragon points you earn on any of your characters in that realm are going to be shared among all characters in that realm.

674
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So if you earn 25 or 50 Paragon points on one character and then hop over to your alt, you're going to have 25 or 50 more Paragon points to spend on that character too.

675
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And in addition to this change, we have a pretty hefty Paragon level increase.

676
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So right now the current max besides renown and altar of Lilith bonuses is 200.

677
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And we're increasing that up to 300, which is going to give you a lot more levels to chase throughout any given season.

678
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Okay. And in light of these changes coming to Paragon, we've made some adjustments to the way that boards work as well.

679
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So because we're offering so much more power with legendary glyphs and they mean so much more to your build,

680
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:18,000
you know, we're, we're looking to set a maximum for the number of Paragon boards that you can equip at any given time.

681
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And this is also because, you know, on live right now, the best strategy is to aim for as many glyph slots as possible.

682
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You just go off. You oftentimes ignore whatever legendary node bonus you're getting just for the glyph slot.

683
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And we want to make sure that you're really focusing on these legendary nodes and that you're focusing on these really cool legendary glyphs that you're getting.

684
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And, and really think about those choices instead of gunning for like every single glyph, for example.

685
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:57,000
This also complements the additional, I was just going to say this, this really helps complement the additional 100 more levels.

686
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Like we've heard a lot of feedback that it feels really flat once you hit 100, that there's just no more progression.

687
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You don't really need to kill any of the monsters anymore unless it's explicitly to get the, the loot drop off of them.

688
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And that, that, that kind of feels bad, right?

689
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Like I'm walking through this dungeon and like I get literally nothing out of killing these, these monsters.

690
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So with the board limit, we've packed a ton of power with additional Paragon levels to grind a ton of power with the legendary glyphs.

691
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But it also creates a situation where once you're sort of, you've achieved all those different things, you don't feel so bad necessarily around not getting to that Paragon level 300.

692
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:45,000
At a certain point, you start to really just sort of really need to hone in on your build and those extra Paragon points are going to start providing you more of a show of sort of how badass you are and give you incremental progress.

693
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:54,000
incremental progress that's a little bit less sort of demanding that you must grind through all of this content to unlock every part of your Paragon board.

694
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah.

695
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah. And something I'm pretty excited about this is that, you know, sometimes on live, it can feel like my goal is to get a new Paragon board.

696
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And as soon as I achieve that, my goal is to get a new Paragon board and get off the one I just unlocked.

697
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And I think this change really lets me kind of explore the boards and think about what specific route optimizations I want to take.

698
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And lets me personalize that a little more, which I'm a pretty big fan of.

699
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Well, I know we have a, we just went through a ton of content right here with all the changes that are coming for progression to Paragon to itemization.

700
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I know it was a lot for people to hear.

701
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:42,000
We will actually have a blog immediately up after the stream that will kind of also explain a little bit more of this to players so that they can actually get a understanding of what that is.

702
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:51,000
A understanding in their own cadence of like what it, what is going to be changing with patch 2.0 for Diablo 4 in regards to some of the progression items.

703
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I know Colin, we're seeing a lot in chat of like, you know, people are noting like, hey, this, this feels a little D3-ish in ways.

704
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I don't know if you wanted to chat or like comment on that a little bit more.

705
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah, I'm happy to.

706
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It's definitely familiar, right?

707
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:17,000
So we thought a lot about like, what is the right way to address the player feedback of we've gotten a bunch of feedback around like World Tier 5, World Tier 6, World Tier 7, right?

708
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I want to be able to level up the challenge in the game.

709
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I want to be able to get more efficiency.

710
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And we wanted to do it in a way that was leaning into what we saw you all were really resonating with, which is getting to the end game faster.

711
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And we felt like, okay, well, we could add a World Tier 5 and add ancestral, uber ancestral and increase the level cap.

712
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:45,000
But that would mean you just need to grind more to get to that point where you're finding your forever items, doing item modification.

713
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And we get out of World Tier 6, uber, uber ancestral, right?

714
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And it just sort of made us reevaluate what is important.

715
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And it's what's important to us is getting people into the end game, getting people finding their forever items, smashing monsters, getting more powerful sort of item modification and efficiency.

716
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So that was part of it.

717
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And then the other part of it, I'd say, is I think Diablo 4 more than any Diablo has had a ton of item customization and power along the leveling journey, which really makes the leveling progression feel different, right?

718
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Like if you're tempering, if you're imbuing aspects, if you're really min-maxing your reward scheme, you can really push difficulty tiers early.

719
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
If you've played D3 hard is really the only real difficulty, right?

720
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:42,000
But because we have so many different ways to grow your power, we think that represents a pretty fun challenge of like, how do I take all these pieces and really push as early as I can to get to that max level faster?

721
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And one more thing that's really important to note is the jumps between Torments are pretty enormous.

722
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:58,000
We don't expect you to sort of play it like today's D3, where you essentially log in, get your Hedrigg set, and hop right into Torment 16.

723
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:10,000
The jumps are actually pretty enormous between Torment 1 and 2, and it creates this really fun progression through those Torment tiers, and it feels like a meaningful step forward when you get into Torment 2 and then a Torment 3.

724
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:19,000
We're hoping this doesn't necessarily feel like a two-hour sort of journey through the Torment tiers, and then now you're in Torment 4, and that's how you play the rest of the game.

725
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Awesome.

726
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah, and also, one thing I'll add is, you know, shouts to Twitch chat, everything that you say, hey, you like what we're doing, big dub, we appreciate it, much love for the response.

727
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Also, all the people in Twitch chat who are like, I don't like this, this isn't working for me.

728
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Much appreciation the same, you know, we're looking at what you're saying, we're thinking about it, and we're going to try to incorporate it and make the game better.

729
00:59:43,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And I think it's interesting, I'm seeing the sort of Diablo 3 references, and it's like, from our perspective, if something really worked well in Diablo 3, that's more important to us to do the thing that the players felt like was working for them than anything else, right?

730
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,000
The fact that we've done it before in any form, to me, wouldn't stop us from doing the right thing, you know what I mean?

731
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah, and I just do it the right way.

732
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I just said, do it the right way for D4.

733
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Sorry, go ahead, Adam.

734
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,000
This is the difficulty of doing everything remote, it feels like we're like, it's like a Zoom call, but interrupting each other.

735
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And also, big, big shout out to Twitch chat for calling out Jeevan's cord management.

736
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I've seen that message a few times already.

737
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
But, so, thanks Aislinn, thank you, Colin.

738
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I know Colin's going to be joining us more on a couple other topics, but we still have a lot to talk about in this stream.

739
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And the next thing that we do want to talk about is class changes and everything.

740
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And so, Charles will be taking us through all the class changes for Patch 2.0.

741
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Yeah, awesome.

742
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:03,000
So, before we get into some of the slides and details, I just wanted to thank Colin and Aislinn for talking about all the systemic updates that are coming,

743
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
and how we're going to test your character and how you're going to progress through it.

744
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But my topic is going to be a bit more about what are the exact abilities and skills and new legendary effects and uniques that you're going to get to take on these awesome challenges that are set up through the difficulty tier system.

745
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And also, a slight disclaimer, you know, PTR is a very early build for whatever is going to go live on Patch 2.0.

746
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
And some of the assets that we've captured here are also still, you know, early on.

747
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And so, some of the exact numbers or some of the wording may slightly be changed.

748
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:44,000
So, definitely refer to the patch notes, which we're going to be publishing right after the stream for the exact details and, you know, kind of final, in air quotes, numbers that are going to go on the PTR.

749
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And, of course, it still may be subject to change before we actually launch Patch 2.0 live.

750
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
All right.

751
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So, with that out of the way, let's start talking about some of the tempering changes that are going to come in Patch 2.0.

752
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So, tempering is a system that we introduced back in Season of Loot Reborn, Season 4, that gave you a way to really customize your items and kind of make your build your own.

753
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And we've received a lot of feedback on the tempering system, and we're really committed to iterating on and making sure this system is the best it can possibly be going forward.

754
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
One of the key points of feedback that we heard was around weapon tempers.

755
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
So, these affixes that you get to attach to your weapons, right?

756
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Your weapons are your big, important part of your build and your character.

757
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And there was a big disparity here, where some affixes that were on weapon tempering were multiplicatively increasing your player power, right?

758
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Things like double projectiles or things of that nature or bash cleaving, which was a multiplicative bonus.

759
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And others, not so much, right?

760
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
You had some other ones that were more duration or size effect, and they just were hard to compare against each other.

761
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And so, going forward in Patch 2.0, we've made all weapon tempering affixes multiplicative damage increases, oftentimes to very specific skills.

762
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And to accommodate this, we already have one bonus projectiles, and now we're going to have new affixes that give skills chance to deal double damage,

763
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:16,000
which means if it triggers the chance to deal double damage, the entire skill is just going to do twice as much damage as before.

764
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Every hit of it will deal double damage. It's kind of an all or nothing kind of deal.

765
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And then the chance to hit twice is the chance for any time it deals damage, you just get an extra hit of damage.

766
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And this allows you to trigger things like lucky hit procs or anything that counts the number of times you deal damage.

767
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
That's going to trigger an extra time with the hit twice.

768
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Offensive tempering affixes, these are the ones that can also go on your weapons but can go on other spots as well.

769
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
These are going to be additive damage increases.

770
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And these will often be to broader categories like bonus fire damage or bonus critical strike damage.

771
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And whereas the weapon temperers are often talking to more specific skills.

772
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And so here we can see an example with the shadow augments execution where we have the sever projectiles chance to cast twice.

773
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
But now we've got new ones that are chance for reap to hit twice.

774
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
So you cast reap and every target you hit, there's just a chance to get two hits on that target instead of one.

775
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And corpse explosion, whenever you cast corpse explosion, there is a chance for the entire skill to deal double damage to every target that it hits.

776
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Additionally, we moved those size and duration affixes, which we think are really cool and really interesting ways of modifying your skills.

777
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
We've moved those over to the utility category.

778
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So they're not directly competing with these multiplicative damage increases.

779
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You're not going to feel bad that, oh, I'm missing out on damage just to make my area hit a little bit larger or to have a longer duration on a buff.

780
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So there's not as much opportunity cost to investing in those size and duration affixes, which are still really cool ways to customize your character.

781
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
We just don't want them to compete with damage.

782
01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And finally, we know that oftentimes tempering leads itself to, hey, I see this list of five or even six affixes sometimes.

783
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:09,000
We really are going to try to be limiting tempering recipes to at most four affixes that could possibly roll on them, just to give you a little bit better odds of actually hitting the one that you care about and the one that you want.

784
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And just to be a little bit easier to kind of comprehend.

785
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And even so, we're trying to set this limit at four, but oftentimes we're aiming for just three on the recipe, depending on how the grouping them together in ways that make sense.

786
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So this is an active area that we're working on, really trying to make sure that it's not quite it's easier for you to get the right affix out of the tempering recipe by limiting that the number that are on there.

787
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
All right. Next up, we've got changes to ultimate skills.

788
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So ultimate skills can now gain skill ranks.

789
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:50,000
This is probably pretty self-explanatory, but just like every other skill in the game, ultimate skills can now be ranked up to rank five in the skill tree.

790
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
And just like every other skill, increasing the skill rank will increase the damage output of your ultimate skills.

791
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But it's also going to give you cooldown reduction on these ultimate skills as well.

792
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So oftentimes other skills, you just kind of get one or the other.

793
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
All right. Sometimes it's a cooldown reduction. Sometimes it's a damage or healing increase.

794
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
On ultimate skills, you're going to get kind of the best of both worlds.

795
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
It's going to be increasing the damage output and reducing the cooldown.

796
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And finally, effects that do grant bonus skill ranks on this, such as, you know, Harlequin's Crest, the Shaco, that gives plus to all skill ranks.

797
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
These are only going to apply to ultimate skills that you've already learned in the skill tree.

798
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
And this is to make sure that you still can only equip one ultimate skill.

799
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,000
You can't like get plus ranks to to all skills and then suddenly have access to four ultimate skills.

800
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
We still don't want that. We still want you to just pick one.

801
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
But you're just going to be getting you're going to be able to really juice that that ultimate skill up.

802
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,000
If you really want to make, you know, lacerate be really strong, that's going to be a powerful effect that you can invest more skill points into.

803
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
All right. So those are some of the general updates.

804
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Let's now talk about the new content coming for each individual class, starting here with our barbarian.

805
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
All right. So sometimes you're playing as a barbarian and you experience a problem, right?

806
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
You are standing here and there is an enemy over there.

807
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
What to do? Well, a good barbarian is going to throw their weapon at the enemy over there to kill them at a distance.

808
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Right. So now we've got a new skill called mighty throw.

809
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's going to hurl your weapon at an enemy. It's going to deal damage on impact.

810
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And then it's going to stick in the ground and do some pulses of damage over time.

811
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
So even if the initial impact doesn't kill them, there's going to be some extra pulses there.

812
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Additionally, we've got some upgrades for it, just like our other skills.

813
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Enhanced mighty throw is going to increase your attack speed while the weapon is out.

814
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And then you can either opt in a fighter's mighty throw, which is going to give bonuses to that pulsing damage.

815
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
It causes your weapon swaps to pulse for more and give you a bit of barrier.

816
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Or you can opt into a warrior's mighty throw, which is going to dramatically increase the initial impact damage.

817
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And it's going to stun enemies on impact.

818
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Let's take a video clip of this in action.

819
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:04,000
All right. So we've got Barb. Just a simple example here with a few enemies.

820
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You know, throws out this, you know, ephemeral version of the weapon, lands, deals a big chunk of damage,

821
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
and then pulses over time before returning back to you.

822
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I was a huge fan of double throw in Diablo 2. So this is really exciting.

823
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah, it looks sweet too. It kind of like bluish yellow, like ancient-y kind of color scheme to it.

824
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
The VFX looks awesome on it.

825
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So range barb is definitely happening in patch 2.0.

826
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
For sure. If you want to spec really heavily into this, yeah, you're going to be throwing weapons out like crazy.

827
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,000
All right. So we've also got some new key passives and new legendary paragon nodes for every class here.

828
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So for Barbarian, we've got Barbed Carapace. This is a key passive.

829
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So it's going to increase your thorns based on how much fear you're spending.

830
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And whenever you cast a skill with a cooldown, it's going to grant you unhindered for a duration,

831
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
which allows you to move through enemies.

832
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And then enemies that are close to you are going to take bonus or going to take damage from your thorns every second.

833
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
You're going to kind of pulse damage of your thorns every second.

834
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Now, this is really cool. It really enables a thorns barb, which we had a little bit of support for.

835
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
But, you know, one of the big problems with thorns is that you really wanted enemies to hit you and hit you quickly.

836
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And this gives you another alternative to deal bonus damage or to really pay off for building up all that thorns with this new key passive.

837
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Additionally, we've got a legendary paragon node, the force of nature.

838
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Your earthquakes have a chance to spawn dust devils and your earthquake damage is going to be increased by your damage against close enemies.

839
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So this is really plays into these these earthquakes and dust devil effects, which we kind of call sub powers internally.

840
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:49,000
These effects that are not skills that you cast directly, but, you know, some of your legendary effects will will spawn these earthquakes and dust devils.

841
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
This is just a new way to to really power those up and blend them together in the same build.

842
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Additionally, we're adding some new passives to the skill tree.

843
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And this is really helped to to give you a way along with ultimate skill ranks to spend a lot of those new points that you're getting by leveling up from 50 to 60.

844
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You know, those new skill points you're getting. We're giving you some new new ways to invest those.

845
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
All right. We also got some new items, of course.

846
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
We've got the ugly bastard helm, a new unique helm for barbarians.

847
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
And it makes you so ugly that whenever you are berserking, all of your damage is converted into fire damage.

848
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And so that's really interesting. You know, barbarians always had this little bit of like light fire theme.

849
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
You had a few different effects that dealt fire damage.

850
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And now if you really want to play a fire barb, this is the unique helm for you.

851
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Also playing into that, we've got aspect of flaming rampage, which causes your charge to deal some fire damage.

852
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And aspect of shuddering steel, which will cause your steel grasp and iron maelstrom to do some bonus physical damage.

853
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
All right. Moving on to the druid.

854
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,000
The druid gets a new skill, a new core skill, in fact, called stone burst.

855
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And this is a core skill that's channeled. It kind of has a very unique kind of input mechanism compared to pretty much any other skill in Diablo 4.

856
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And as you're channeling it, you target an area.

857
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And as you channel it, the affected area grows in size over about one second of channeling.

858
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:24,000
And at any point you can release the channel and it's going to deal a big burst of damage to whatever size you kind of landed on there.

859
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You could tap it really quickly and just do one pulse of damage to a small area or you can channel up for a little bit longer and hit a much wider area,

860
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,000
depending on the exact combat scenario you find yourself in or how the enemies are distributed on the battlefield here.

861
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Of course, we've got our upgrades that increase damage to the enemies hit in the initial radius.

862
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
So, you know, really doubling down on that single target capability of a core skill.

863
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:56,000
And Primal Stone Burst gives you some attack speed and Raging Stone Burst will dramatically increase the spirit cost, but also give it a ton more damage.

864
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So if you have a ton of spirit generation, then that might be the upgrade you look for in Stone Burst.

865
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Let's see a video of this in action.

866
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
All right. So you see it ticks up. There's like three different levels, like small, medium and large.

867
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
In this one, the Druid kind of held it for a while, but you could release it at any time.

868
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And so here you see just kind of rapid firing a lot of quick, small shots just because they knew that would be enough to clear out the enemies here.

869
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And also while you're channeling it does some pulses of damage to enemies in that area as well.

870
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
The channel explosion is so satisfying to blow up just so many monsters.

871
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Yeah, it gets huge and it looks so sweet too.

872
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I really hats off to the VFX artists who worked on making these look so beautiful.

873
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
The new skills here.

874
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:54,000
All right. So of course, Druid also has new passives, a new key passive called One with Nature that really empowers companion builds.

875
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
You know, we've heard a lot that players love playing with companions.

876
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
They're wolves, they're poison creepers, they're ravens.

877
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
And this is going to be the key passive for you.

878
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So all of your companion skills gain an additional companion and they deal increased damage.

879
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And there's also a little bonus basically with the you gain the passive effect of all of the companion skills.

880
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Now, if you're taking this key passive, you're probably taking these companions anyway.

881
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
But just in case, you know, your build is such that, well, I just want to take, you know, two out of the three.

882
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Right. I can put wolves and poison creeper on my bar.

883
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
But, you know, maybe you you don't have enough skill slots to put in ravens.

884
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:36,000
You're still going to be able to get the passive effect of that when you take this key passive because we just want you to have tons of these companions really leading leading the charge here.

885
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:43,000
We've also got Untamed, a new legendary paragon node that plays right into this One with Nature key passive.

886
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Casting the companion skill is going to increase the companion.

887
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Companion active skill will grant you bonus ranks to all of your companion skills for a time to really buff up the damage of those.

888
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Just like before, we've got some new passives coming into the skill tree as well.

889
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I think some of these might have some temporary icons on them.

890
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
So like I said, these were from an early build.

891
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Some of the icons or very specific art might be adjusted.

892
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
So, you know, bear with us. This is the nature of PTR and early development.

893
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
All right, moving on to some of the items or oh, no, we've got a video.

894
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,000
All right, a video of really leading a wolf pack here.

895
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Right. So this this includes wolves with the storm's companion to turn them into light werewolves.

896
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And I'm sure there's some other ones here like aspect of the stampede is probably involved.

897
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
You just have what is that seven wolves following you around.

898
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You really get to lead the wolf pack with this.

899
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
This is this is the best video in our presentation.

900
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Well, actually, no, sorry. This is the second best video in our presentation.

901
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You guys will see the best video in our presentation.

902
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
But I see it's so good. Yeah. For all you werewolf lovers out there.

903
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
This this one is going to be really sweet.

904
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I'm really looking forward to playing with this in patch 2.0.

905
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
All right. So new items. So they've got the Stone of Vehemmin.

906
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
This is a unique totem that's going to empower your stone burst, the new core skill.

907
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So channeling it is going to grant you some damage reduction.

908
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And the final explosion will deal increased damage based on how long you were channeling it.

909
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:21,000
So this just really encourage you to build it up to that max size and let off a huge explosion and gives you some damage reduction.

910
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
So you're kind of standing still for a bit. That's OK. You get a bit of bonus damage reduction.

911
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:32,000
We've got a little bit more legendaries on Druid than the other classes just because Stone Burst being a core skill.

912
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,000
We know that the kind of bar to make a core skill really viable and useful.

913
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
It does need a good amount of legendary items to support it to really make a full build out of it.

914
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
So that's why we've added two legendaries here for Stone Burst.

915
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
We've got the aspect of Anticline Burst, which causes Stone Burst to deal increased damage.

916
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And if you cast it at or above 100 spirit here, it's going to immediately be at that maximum size.

917
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
So you don't necessarily need to channel it as long as you are casting it when you have a lot of spirit.

918
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:07,000
This synergizes really well with the Earth and Might key passive, which gives you full spirit when it triggers.

919
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
So you can trigger Earth and Might and then immediately get a huge stone burst.

920
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:17,000
We've got an aspect of Shattered Defenses, which alters Stone Burst in a rather interesting way.

921
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:26,000
It causes Stone Burst or Stone Burst causes enemies to take increased damage from your other skills for a time and reduces Stone Burst spirit cost.

922
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,000
This kind of converts Stone Burst away from necessarily being your primary damage source to being a bit more of a setup skill.

923
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Right. You can kind of debuff enemies and then, you know, you can find some interesting builds where you have other ways of spending your spirit, maybe another core skill or Boulder or some other primary damage source.

924
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And then you can use Stone Burst to kind of set up that build. Really interesting to see how players, well, you know, what kind of builds you make with Shattered Defenses.

925
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Additionally, we've got Aspect of the Rabid Bear, which empowers your Grizzly Rage to apply rabies and increases your poison output.

926
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Stormcrow, which is just lightning ravens. You know, your ravens are not lightning. It looks awesome.

927
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And Aspect of the Agile Wolf, which gives Shred a fourth attack. Shred normally is like a three part combo.

928
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And now it's a four part combo that deals even more damage on that fourth hit. And it's going to knock down enemies as well.

929
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
All right. So that is Druid really looking forward to playing some Druid in 2.0.

930
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
But let's move on to the Necromancer because we've got a lot to get through.

931
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
We've got Soul Rift. This is a new darkness ultimate skill.

932
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:42,000
So Necromancers kind of had three ultimates already. They had one that was blood, one that was bone, and one that was related to summoning.

933
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And now we've kind of completed it and we've added a darkness or shadow damage ultimate.

934
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Soul Rift creates an area around your character, kind of follows with you, that just constantly deals damage over time.

935
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
And it's going to be sucking out the souls of enemies who you're hitting.

936
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
And every time it sucks out a soul from an enemy, you're going to gain some essence and you're going to gain a barrier.

937
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,000
So you can stack up this barrier. It helps you be survivable and it deals really good damage over time.

938
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Supreme Soul Rift gives you bonus damage for every soul that you absorb.

939
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And Prime Soul Rift causes the soul absorption to also apply vulnerable.

940
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Let's take a video of this in action here.

941
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
All right. So enemies all are all coming up.

942
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
The barrier is super useful, Charles, right?

943
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Now that you have another way to give yourself defenses.

944
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Necro has historically had some trouble with that, right?

945
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah, absolutely.

946
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I think that's a really important part here.

947
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And when we get to the next slide, talk about some of the passives.

948
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We'll highlight we're adding a bit more barrier into the Necromancer's kit.

949
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
You know, blood Necromancers always had a really easy time surviving.

950
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
They had a lot of Fortify and a lot of max health.

951
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And really, the other ones like the Bone and Shadow Necro didn't have quite as much survivability.

952
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And so now we're introducing more barrier in more places to ensure that non-blood Necromancer builds, the Shadow and the Bone and Summon Necros, have a bit more survivability and are able to scale into that late game pretty well.

953
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
All right. So as I mentioned, the new passive.

954
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So they have a new key passive called Affliction that there's this new concept of Affliction where applying vulnerable, crowd control or shadow damage over time effects to enemies will apply them with Affliction, which is going to make them take increased damage from you and your minions.

955
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Additionally, when you apply a curse skill to someone or to an enemy who has this Affliction, you're going to do a big chunk of shadow damage.

956
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So this kind of turns your curse skills, your Decrepify and Iron Maiden, into offensive skills.

957
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,000
You can curse an area and then they take a big chunk of damage as well.

958
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And this will scale up with the bonus damage that you've dealt or that you are the bonus affixes that you have for that crowd control, vulnerable and shadow damage.

959
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And along that same theme, the new legendary Paragon node, Frailty, is going to cause cursed enemies to take more damage from you.

960
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And so it plays very nicely with the Affliction key passive.

961
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And once again, more skill tree passives to spend those extra points on.

962
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And I want to highlight Necrotic Fortitude here in the upper right that gives you just a generic passive that gives you a chance, a lucky hit chance to gain a barrier.

963
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:30,000
And so that's going to be really good for anybody who wants just a bit more bump of survivability and to play into the more barrier focused on Necromancer.

964
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Yeah, going back to Affliction really quick. I love the idea of using my curses offensively, like as a damage skill.

965
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I think that's going to be such a blast.

966
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Yeah, it's really cool to just, yeah, definitely going to be blasting with them.

967
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I think it's really thematic too. I love playing with it.

968
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It pairs really well with the utility changes now that we have way more size increases in utility.

969
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
It gives you so many more utility options. Those curses get pretty huge and it feels great.

970
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Yeah, for all of us who just want to win by debuff spamming, I love that one.

971
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Absolutely. All right, let's talk about some of the new items coming for Necromancer here.

972
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,000
So we've got a new unique item, the Unmaker, a unique helm.

973
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
This is going to empower the Soul Rift, the new ultimate skill.

974
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Of course, you gain some skill ranks to Soul Rift, because now ultimate skills have skill ranks.

975
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And every 30 essence that you spend while Soul Rift is active will increase its duration up to eight seconds.

976
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:41,000
So as long as you're active and kind of spending the essence with the Unmaker, you're going to have a very long duration of Soul Rift.

977
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:48,000
And then for every essence that you gain while it's active, which absorbing the souls does trigger essence gain,

978
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
you're going to do a pulse of damage around you, some bonus damage.

979
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And so I really encourage you to just keep Soul Rift up all the time, be constantly gaining and spending the essence.

980
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
And it's going to be really, really fun to make that build work.

981
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Additionally, we've got Reaping Lotus Aspect.

982
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
This empowers your Sever, your core skill.

983
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Sever will no longer return to you.

984
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Previously, Sever was kind of an out-and-back situation.

985
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Now it just goes out and then it splits into three Spectres at the end, deals some extra bonus damage.

986
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And then that's the end of the Sever.

987
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
So it really does empower it on the swing out and looks really cool.

988
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
We've got Aspect of Fel Gluttony that empowers your Golem.

989
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Whenever you cast your Golems active, deals a big pulse of damage around it.

990
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
And your Golem will then consume corpses to reduce its cooldown.

991
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,000
So anybody who really wants to build around making your Golem as strong as possible, this is going to be the Aspect for you.

992
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:50,000
And finally, we've got Phasing Poltergeists Aspect, which causes your Bone Spirit to split into three Spirits that deal a percentage of the damage as well.

993
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I think we got a video clip of this one because it looks really sweet.

994
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:00,000
So you cast Bone Spirit at one target and then it spawns three little mini Bone Spirits to seek out nearby enemies as well.

995
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
So it kind of gives you increased area of effect.

996
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And if there's just one target, of course, it'll reconverge back on that same target as well.

997
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
But also just adds a bit more AOE capability for your Bone Spirit build.

998
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Very cool.

999
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
All right.

1000
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
So Rogue.

1001
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Rogue gets Dance of Knives.

1002
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
This is a new channeled skill for Rogue.

1003
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
It's an agility cutthroat skill.

1004
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,000
And it also has a pretty interesting mechanic where it has some charges that will recharge.

1005
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And how long you can channel it is based on how many charges you have.

1006
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
It's going to take one charge per second of channeling.

1007
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
But there's no energy cost or just like a normal cooldown.

1008
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Here you can just channel it as long as you have charges.

1009
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And while you're channeling it, you're going to be spinning around.

1010
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
You're going to be throwing knives at enemies nearby.

1011
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
And you're going to gain some movement speed and dodge chance.

1012
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
It really is kind of like a spin to win kind of build on Rogue here.

1013
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
You've got Enhanced Dance of Knives which gives you some charge refund as you're moving with it.

1014
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Because that's what you really want to encourage is this constant motion.

1015
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
This forward momentum.

1016
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And Methodical Dance of Knives drops some stun grenades when you finish channeling.

1017
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Or Disciplined Dance of Knives will slow enemies and have a chance to pierce through the enemies that you're throwing the daggers at.

1018
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Let's take a look at this in action.

1019
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:24,000
So here we've got the Rogue just going spinning, throwing some daggers around at everyone.

1020
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And yeah.

1021
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
This is awesome.

1022
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Speed farming.

1023
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
This is like the best speed farming still.

1024
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Yeah.

1025
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And that animation is just amazing.

1026
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Absolutely.

1027
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And you can see there at the end they had the upgrade that dropped a bunch of stun grenades at the end.

1028
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Obviously enemies were all dead.

1029
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:48,000
But you know if you use this to get into a big cluster of enemies then you stop the channel, you drop some stun grenades, reset some of your charges and you're good to start spinning again.

1030
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
A ton of fun.

1031
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Yeah.

1032
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Those are perfect for like you run into an elite pack after slaughtering a bunch of normals and it just annihilates the elites.

1033
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
It feels amazing.

1034
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Yeah.

1035
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
All right.

1036
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
So we've got new passives as well.

1037
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
New key passive is Alchemical Admixture.

1038
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
And this is empowering your non-physical damage.

1039
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,000
So rogues can do poison, shadow and cold through their various imbuements.

1040
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And when you deal three different types of that non-physical damage, the potency of your imbuement skills is going to be dramatically increased for a time.

1041
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And the more bonus damage that you build on your gear for bonus poison, shadow or cold damage, the further that potency gets increased.

1042
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Really encouraging you to mix and match the different elements.

1043
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:41,000
It's really thematic with the alchemical kind of theme and really supporting a build of rogue that we've kind of had in the game, but really wanted to give that robust support of a key passive for.

1044
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And also we've got a legendary Paragon node, the Dance Macabre, which encourages this kind of one two combo of casting mobility or subterfuge skill increases the damage of your next skill, whatever it might be, by quite a substantial amount.

1045
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:00,000
So you can cast your dash and then position yourself, cast a big rain of arrows and it hits very hard.

1046
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Very cool and actually impacts your moment to moment rotation as well.

1047
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And of course, we've got the new skill tree passives as well.

1048
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
All right, new items.

1049
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
We've got the Pit Fighter's Gaul.

1050
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
This is the Ancestral Unique Ring.

1051
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Or sorry, just a unique ring.

1052
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It's not necessarily.

1053
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
You can find it before Ancestral Tier.

1054
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
And this Pit Fighter's Gaul will empower your smoke grenade.

1055
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So your smoke grenade skill will increase your critical strike damage and then leave a cloud of shadows behind.

1056
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And while you're within that cloud of shadows, you're going to be constantly regaining stealth.

1057
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And so there's a lot of interesting ways you can play off of triggering going into or out of stealth.

1058
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And Pit Fighter's Gaul is just going to really enable that when you cast smoke grenade.

1059
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
We've got an aspect of star shards.

1060
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
This is a new legendary to directly support Dance of Knives.

1061
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:56,000
And the daggers from Dance of Knives have a chance to shatter, creating more shards of metal that deal bonus damage.

1062
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And you can now use combo points on Dance of Knives to further increase the channel duration if you've opted into the combo points specialization.

1063
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Aspect of Poisonous Clouds plays well with Pit Fighter's Gaul.

1064
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
When you gain stealth, you create a cloud of poison damage.

1065
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:18,000
And aspect of Splendering Shards, there's just a chance whenever you're hitting a frozen enemy to create some ice spikes.

1066
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:25,000
So if you're freezing enemies because you're playing Alchem-Glad Mixture and using Coldimbue, Splendering Shards might be a good aspect for you as well.

1067
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
All right, moving on to the Sorceress.

1068
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Let's move on to the Sorceress. The Sorceress gets a new conjuration skill called the Familiar.

1069
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:42,000
This is a conjuration skill that is all three elements. It is a Shock skill, a Pyromancy skill, and a Frost skill.

1070
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,000
So there's three charges of it, so you can cast it back to back.

1071
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And you summon a Familiar of the element of your last skill cast.

1072
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,000
So if you just cast a Pyromancy skill, you're going to summon a Fire Familiar.

1073
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
If you just cast a Lightning skill, you'll summon a Lightning Familiar.

1074
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
And same with a Cold, you'll summon a Cold Familiar.

1075
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,000
And with the Enhanced Effect, these Familiars will do a bonus effect.

1076
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:13,000
So the Fire Familiar will constantly apply some burning to enemies that it's around.

1077
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
The Cold Familiar will chill, and Lightning Familiar will stun.

1078
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And of course, their damage type is going to be based on what type they are, so that it'll benefit from all of your bonus fire damage.

1079
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And that aura, Charles, is really great, right, to tap into some of the passives on the Sorcerer.

1080
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, there's a lot of passives that say,

1081
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:38,000
hey, you get bonuses against burning enemies, for instance.

1082
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Now, if you have the Fire Familiar, that's going to really easily be able to apply that constantly,

1083
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
and you're going to have pretty high uptime on having Familiars out because of the way the charge and duration works.

1084
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Let's take a look at this in action.

1085
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
All right, so initially, we cast a Frost Familiar here, right?

1086
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
It's jumping around, and it's landing, it's doing Frost damage.

1087
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Then we cast a Fire Skill.

1088
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Now we get a Fire Familiar jumping around and kind of dive bombing on enemies.

1089
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And then finally, we get a Shock Familiar, a Lightning Familiar here that's going to be a Lightning damage.

1090
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:14,000
So you can kind of mix and match these depending on what skills you use, what combination you cast them in.

1091
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And it's really flexible. It fits into a lot of different builds.

1092
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Even if you're just a pure, say, Fire Sword, and you just want to do Fire Damage, you just want to do Burning,

1093
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
this could still fit because you're just going to be able to summon the Fire Familiar.

1094
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:36,000
But it really reaches its maximum potential as you're kind of mix and matching these to suit the situation and apply the debuffs that you want onto the enemies.

1095
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And you can have quite a few of these out. For the Sega demonstration, I think we only have a couple of them out on screen, but I think you can have up to like six, right?

1096
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Yeah, you can have up to six, and that would make a lot more sense once we get to talk about some of the unique items that are coming with this patch.

1097
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:00,000
But first, let's talk about the new passives. And we've got Enlightenment.

1098
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
This really also plays into the concept of mixing and matching the elements.

1099
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:13,000
You see it's got all three kind of colors on there. Casting a skill grants a stack of Enlightenment, or three stacks, if your skill was a different element to the one before.

1100
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:22,000
So you're alternating here. And whenever you gain max stacks, you're going to become Enlightened, and you get a ton of bonuses for being in this Enlightened state.

1101
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
But then it drops off over time.

1102
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,000
It's really a reward for mixing and matching those elements, more so than any other key passes we've had on Swerg before.

1103
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And similarly, with the Legendary Paragon node, Fundamental Release, each Fire, Lightning, and Cold attack you make in San Ami increase the damage they take from all sources by 10%.

1104
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
So you really need to hit them with all three types to gain the maximum bonus here.

1105
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
All right, on to the unique items.

1106
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:55,000
So, Siday Bindings. This is a unique gloves, and this plays right into the familiar.

1107
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
So whenever you cast familiar with this unique on, you're going to summon all three elemental variants at once.

1108
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
However, it does come with a bit of restrictions on it.

1109
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:12,000
So familiar's duration is going to be dramatically increased, and it's cooldown reduced, but you're going to have one less charge of it.

1110
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:19,000
So you won't be able to spam this quite as much, but you press the button once or twice, and then you get the maximum familiar result.

1111
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:24,000
They're all over the screen, and they're going to last for quite a long time with this unique glove.

1112
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
So it's going to be really, really powerful too.

1113
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
If you're all about this Conjuration build, all about amping up the power from the familiar, it's an awesome unique for that.

1114
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Additionally, we've got new Legendaries for the aspect of overheating.

1115
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
After channeling Incinerate for a time, you're going to deal bonus damage to the target.

1116
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And casting Incinerate will refresh and maintain the bonus.

1117
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
So really just powering up your Incinerate.

1118
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Charged Flash, this empowers charged bolts.

1119
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And after you hit a certain number of enemies with charged bolts, your next three casts of charged bolts will no longer send out bolts.

1120
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
They're going to send out big waves of lightning that deal even more damage, and it's always going to be a crit.

1121
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And then aspect of Elemental Constellation.

1122
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Once again, more about the mixing and matching of all three elements.

1123
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Casting one of the Elemental Skills will summon a matching type Elemental Dagger that will pierce through enemies.

1124
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And the damage of that dagger is going to be increased if you get all three of the different Element types in that timeframe.

1125
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:31,000
All right, so I think, oh, right, we've got new Mythic Uniques.

1126
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Of course, how can I forget?

1127
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
New Mythic Unique items.

1128
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
These are the strongest items in the game.

1129
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
We've got Shroud of False Death.

1130
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
And I think the really cool part about this is it's just Inherent Apex.

1131
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It's going to grant plus one skill rank to all passives.

1132
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
And this is really awesome as we're adding new passives into the skill tree.

1133
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,000
This is just a ton of power for this new unique chest.

1134
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And its effect is if you haven't attacked in the last two seconds, you're going to gain Stealth and bonus movement speed.

1135
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Now, Stealth historically has just been a mechanic that has been on Rogues and a little bit on Druids with the Werewolf builds.

1136
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
But now every class, if you get this Mythic Unique, is going to have some access to Stealth.

1137
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:22,000
You can drop out of combat for a little bit and then you get into Stealth and you get tons of movement speed to maybe move on to the next pack or move somewhere else in the dungeon.

1138
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
And it's a really simple line, all passives, but it's literally all passives, which is insane.

1139
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Like, it's incredibly powerful.

1140
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Absolutely.

1141
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And we've also got the Heir of Perdition, a Mythic Unique Helm.

1142
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And this one has an interesting effect.

1143
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,000
So it says, give into hatred and earn Lilith's favor, increasing your damage dealt by 60%.

1144
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
So just baseline, this is a huge damage bonus.

1145
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:59,000
And the second line here says, slaughter enemies to briefly steal Lilith's favor from nearby allies.

1146
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So this means if you're playing in a group with somebody else who happens to have the Heir of Perdition equipped, you are able to steal Lilith's favor from them.

1147
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Lilith will only favor one of you.

1148
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
And you actually gain double the bonus of this, right?

1149
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000
If you steal someone else's favor, you get 120% bonus damage.

1150
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
And they would get zero.

1151
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
But if you're just playing this solo, no one else has their Perdition round.

1152
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:30,000
It's just a flat 60% bonus damage, which is still a ton and very impactful for a Mythic Unique.

1153
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
All right. I believe that is actually everything.

1154
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Wow, that is so much new class content, new skills, new legendaries, new everything.

1155
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And I didn't even get to talk about some of our other, you know, more regular class balance changes, you know, updates to existing skills and legendaries.

1156
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
So make sure you definitely check out the patch notes.

1157
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:56,000
There is still more changes to come, but we're already really deep into this campfire chat and we didn't want to extend it too much longer.

1158
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
So make sure you check out the patch notes for all the details on those other changes coming as well.

1159
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Yeah, thank you so much, Charles.

1160
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I know we have gone through a lot of information.

1161
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:14,000
We're in our 1.5 of this campfire chat, as I said, and I mentioned on social, like this is going to be a very beefy campfire chat.

1162
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
We still have two more things that we do want to really cover off.

1163
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And as Charles had mentioned, there are a lot of other class changes that we didn't actually fit within the presentation, like a lot of balance specific items.

1164
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:31,000
So that will be on patch notes and patch notes will be available on our blog for PTR immediately after the stream.

1165
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
So please check that out.

1166
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
We are going to jump into some quality of life items.

1167
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And so, Colin, do you want to take us through some quick quality of life items?

1168
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I'll be coming with 2.0.

1169
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Yeah, I'll go quick so we can get to the super exciting, cool thing.

1170
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Yeah.

1171
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:53,000
So the first one here is you can now select your preferred town portal location.

1172
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
So how that's going to work is you're going to open up the map and hover over any of the waypoints.

1173
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And when you right click on it, it's going to set that as essentially your preferred location.

1174
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And whenever you town portal, it's going to take you there.

1175
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
So this is really helpful for when you're doing whispers, for example.

1176
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
You just set the tree of whispers as your preferred location.

1177
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Do some whispers.

1178
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
When you press T, you go right there.

1179
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
You don't have to open up the map and click on the waypoint and click on accept.

1180
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Like it's all very seamless and it's just removing a lot of the inputs that you have to do to get back to town quickly.

1181
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
The next thing here is we're adding a dungeon key inventory tab for things like nightmare sigils.

1182
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
So that just gives you more space for more activities.

1183
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
So much room for activities.

1184
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:41,000
The next one here is we've done a pretty substantial rework of monster CC.

1185
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:49,000
And this is in the spirit of we want to have really clear sort of delineations between normal monsters and elite monsters.

1186
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:54,000
And we didn't like how often you're getting slowed down and how mandatory unstoppable could feel.

1187
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:01,000
So, you know, I always felt bad to be fighting this huge horde of enemies and you see this elite and you're paying attention to the elite.

1188
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And then like this goat man, Mauler comes up and like sneak attacks you and knocks you down for three seconds.

1189
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And that's the thing that kills you.

1190
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
That always felt like bullshit.

1191
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Right. So what we've done is we've sort of overhauled a lot of the normal monster CCs to be quick and snappy.

1192
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Like you still feel them.

1193
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
You kind of want to avoid them still.

1194
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
But they're much less sort of the reason why you die entirely.

1195
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So the vampire impale when like the two hander like comes and stabs you and stuns you for three seconds.

1196
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
That's turned into an immobilize.

1197
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
So you can't move, but you can just smack them in the face.

1198
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:39,000
And then the werewolf leap is another great example where previously they'd come out of stealth and like leap attack on you and you get dazed and you'd walk around confused.

1199
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
And now they just does it does a quick knockback.

1200
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:51,000
This next change here is small, but I think it's a blaster's delight, which is all the monsters that had really long death animations all die instantly.

1201
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
You don't have to wait for the loot to hit the ground.

1202
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
It's very satisfying.

1203
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:02,000
You know, the big ass like spider hosts that crawl towards you when you kill them, they pop instantly and all the spiders go and hit the walls and it feels great.

1204
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
The zombies feel really good to it.

1205
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Like they pop instantly when you kill them.

1206
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
And it's a very satisfying experience.

1207
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
So this should speed up combat quite a bit and it just feels really good.

1208
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:24,000
The next thing here is their socketable inventory tab, another tab for you, for you to put socketables like gems and other socketables.

1209
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
And then there's also an additional stash tab that we're going to add.

1210
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:33,000
The next thing, if we could roll the clip, we took out just about all the.

1211
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:40,000
All would go up and then like click on the plunger and don't get hit by the spikes.

1212
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,000
That's all been replaced entirely with just monster packs of varying sizes.

1213
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
And it's just way more seamless.

1214
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,000
In this case, we only rolled some normal monsters, but sometimes it's a couple of elite packs.

1215
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
You never really know what you're going to get.

1216
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It's like an Easter or a kinder egg, I should say.

1217
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,000
And it just helps the dungeon flow substantially, like to just sort of blast through those things.

1218
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:05,000
And then a handful of dungeons have had their procedural logic updated just so there's more variation in the layout.

1219
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
So when you play it, it's just going to roll out differently.

1220
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:14,000
This is really just iterating on our dungeon set to make them feel much more sort of flow inducing, not slowing you down.

1221
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And then the next one here is minor, but actually feels pretty good and it has a big impact on the game.

1222
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
When you get those Paragon and Level Up notifications, we're actually going to tell you how many.

1223
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,000
So sometimes you'll realize, oh my God, I have like 15 skill points I can spend.

1224
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
And it actually tells you the number and it's a nice quality of life change.

1225
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
So I think that's everything.

1226
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Awesome.

1227
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Thank you, Colin, for running through quickly.

1228
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I appreciate the efficiency of going through all the quality of life changes.

1229
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Now I know Jeevan has been very quiet over here.

1230
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:56,000
He's only chimed in a little bit and we do want to talk about a new thing that is coming to Vessel of Hatred specifically and for Vessel of Hatred players.

1231
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:02,000
So Jeevan, will you talk us through it a little bit?

1232
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Yeah, so it's my privilege to kind of talk about a feature that the whole team's been working very hard on that we haven't really mentioned much.

1233
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
And, you know, we looked at the expansion.

1234
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:23,000
We had all these cool things, you know, torment, new class skills, spirit porn, but we thought there was a hole.

1235
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And we wanted to particularly give build crafters a new way to play for Vessel of Hatred.

1236
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:40,000
This is for folks who, like me, whose dream cooking show has nothing to do with British baking, but instead would be called Colin's Kitchen.

1237
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:47,000
So, yeah, let's say, I think some of you already kind of have an idea.

1238
01:40:47,000 --> 01:41:01,000
So, yeah, let's let's let's get into it.

1239
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Some of you already know we're going to be talking about runewords.

1240
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Yeah. So let's let's start with a little background.

1241
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So runewords were in Diablo 2, and they were a very powerful way of augmenting gear with socketable content.

1242
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And there's a lot of good sort of nostalgic feelings.

1243
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
They were popular. They were remembered fondly.

1244
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,000
You can look on the right. That's one of the most iconic examples from Diablo 2.

1245
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:37,000
So the name is Enigma and you would make it with runes, Ja if Burr, and it would get you some some really cool skills that would come out of it when you put it all together.

1246
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And for Diablo 4, we wanted to retain the soul of what Diablo 2 runewords did, which is combining socketable components and creating more powerful items.

1247
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
But we also wanted to do something that felt appropriately fresh and new.

1248
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:05,000
And we wanted to lean into what's unique about the modern game to make the Diablo 4 version of Runewords and make it stand on its own and really feel like the right version to be given to players.

1249
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Yeah. And what was awesome about Diablo 2 runewords, right, was you got the set of runes that made a god item, right?

1250
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And it broke the rules, like being able to teleport on other classes, like what the hell barbarian is teleporting across the screen.

1251
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:26,000
We really wanted to embrace that in a way that extended builds and didn't necessarily enforce you must play with this item.

1252
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
And we're really excited to share what that's sort of manifested, right?

1253
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Yeah. And you all have a lot of builds that you started with from the base game and we want to add on to those.

1254
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So what are runewords? They're a way for you to make your own spells.

1255
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So there are two types of runes. There's runes of ritual and they specify actions from the player that they have to trigger.

1256
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,000
So you can see the example here of the Yul rune, which is a legendary quality rune of ritual.

1257
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
You have to cast a skill which has a cooldown. So, you know, Frost Nova or something like that.

1258
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Then you have runes of invocation. And these grant powerful effects as a result of satisfying those runes of ritual.

1259
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,000
So the example here, the Gar rune gives you two and a half percent critical strike chance for five seconds.

1260
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
And you can stack up to ten times, up to 25%. And you can mix and match these.

1261
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
There'll be a lot of different runes of ritual and runes of invocation.

1262
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And you can put them together as you see fit.

1263
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
So when you combine a rune of ritual and rune of invocation, you pair them together.

1264
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
You put them in an item with two sockets. Boom, you form a runeword.

1265
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,000
And as you can tell, there's going to be rarity. We're going to have magic, rare and legend.

1266
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:41,000
And the higher rarity runes will have more potent conditions or effects.

1267
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:48,000
So one of the important elements of this is called offering, which is the rune resource system.

1268
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:55,000
So your runes of ritual will generate offering and they're meant to feed into their linked runes of invocation so that they can consume that offering.

1269
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:01,000
And the sort of more demanding rituals that we would ask of you as a player gain you more offering.

1270
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:06,000
At the same time, the more powerful invocations that you would try to get require more offering.

1271
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And so there's sort of a sort of like shared economy there.

1272
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,000
So if you can look at these runes on the right, you get 50 offering for casting a skill with a cooldown.

1273
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And this rune only requires 25 offering for it to trigger.

1274
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
That's where overflow comes in.

1275
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Overflow is when an invocation receives an offering in excess of what's needed to trigger it.

1276
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:36,000
But put more simply, it's we want you to have a mix and match system, but we want the pieces to be not super hard that they can't fit together easily when they have some rough edges.

1277
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
So many invocations can get different bonus effects when overflowed.

1278
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Some of them might get increased radius to the effect.

1279
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Some of them might get increased duration, but it'll always be proportional to the overflow amount.

1280
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:53,000
So as an example here, the garb rune only requires 25 offering and it's getting double that, which is 50 from the old rune.

1281
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:01,000
So every time you cast a skill with a cooldown, you'll get two stacks of 2.5% critical strike chance or 5% crit strike.

1282
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
And so that's kind of how you get to play with this system and you get to optimize it in different ways.

1283
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
And it creates a lot of flexibility, right?

1284
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Even like if you do a really demanding ritual trigger, for example, on a really low offering rune of invocation, it's almost a way to start scaling that rune of invocation in a completely different way beyond just triggering the rune.

1285
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Exactly. Yeah.

1286
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:34,000
It lets us as developers be more flexible in creating wide ranges of effects, sort of small ones, big ones, and also the same for the rituals.

1287
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
And you get to kind of decide which ones you think fit your build or are cool.

1288
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
And we do our best to make sure that you can almost cook up anything.

1289
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,000
So a few rules.

1290
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Runes can be socketed into items with two sockets.

1291
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:56,000
We've added another item to get two sockets for Vessel of Hatred.

1292
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So you'll have your helm, your two-hander, your gloves, and sorry, your helm, two-hander, pants, and chest.

1293
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
They can only be paired with a rune of the opposite type.

1294
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
So you have to pair a rune of ritual with a rune of invocation.

1295
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
You can have a maximum of two runewords equipped.

1296
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
You can't equip the same rune twice.

1297
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
And they're available for users who own Vessel of Hatred.

1298
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
They stack in your inventory in the new socketable inventory tab, which will also have your gems.

1299
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And runes are tradable between other players who own Vessel of Hatred.

1300
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:32,000
And they unlock with a quest in the campaign.

1301
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Both runes dropping from as loot, but also runecrafting, which we'll get into later.

1302
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:44,000
And they drop at a higher rate in the Undercity, which is a specific place you can farm them.

1303
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
So now let's get into some clips here.

1304
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
We get to actually see it in action.

1305
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
So this is a barbarian.

1306
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
And the rune of ritual they have is travel five meters.

1307
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Very simple.

1308
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:02,000
And they're going to join that to the earthquake, which is a legendary aspect that you've already seen before, which requires 100 offering.

1309
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,000
So you see, we'll put them together in this item.

1310
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
And then all they have to do is just run around.

1311
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Boom, earthquakes dropping.

1312
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It's going to be insane with the Paragon legendary glyph we just talked about.

1313
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Yeah.

1314
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
The earthquake train is leaving the station.

1315
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,000
What I love about this is it doesn't just count your normal walking, right?

1316
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,000
If you're leaping, if you're charging, that's all counting towards the distance that you're moving, right?

1317
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Oh, whoa.

1318
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And you can see it here in the whirlwind, for instance.

1319
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Like it's obviously spawning earthquakes.

1320
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Was that a druid petrify ultimate?

1321
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
This is supposed to be the wrong clip.

1322
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
All right. Sorry guys.

1323
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
You know, we're doing it live.

1324
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Let's just move on to the next one.

1325
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Okay.

1326
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:51,000
So we have a necromancer here with the rune of ritual cast a non channeled core skill getting 25 each.

1327
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And then this is a classic from D2, gain plus three to all skills.

1328
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:05,000
So you'll get to see this necro's got five skill ranks for reap and sever.

1329
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And they're going to go out and catch the four skill.

1330
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Casual, socketable harlequin crest.

1331
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Pretty good.

1332
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:26,000
So a little pew pew, just doing your basic core skill usage, filling up the offering needed.

1333
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Yeah.

1334
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,000
I really like the little tracking buff that fills up as you as you're getting it.

1335
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So you don't need to really micromanage this.

1336
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
You can just add a glance, see that, hey, I just filled it up and now I get plus three ranks of sever.

1337
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Yep.

1338
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
So now you're a plus three.

1339
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
There you go.

1340
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
What was that?

1341
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:48,000
So yeah, this necro is just cooking and, um, oh, what is this another broken clip?

1342
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Did they just cast teleport?

1343
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
What?

1344
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
What?

1345
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Okay.

1346
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I, I, I think, I think you guys.

1347
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Teleporting necros.

1348
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
What are you cooking over there, Jeevan?

1349
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Yeah, I'll stop making jokes mostly.

1350
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Um, yeah.

1351
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:10,000
So what we really wanted to lean into with D2 runewords, among other things, was the ability to cast other classes skills and use their power and how to cast it.

1352
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
into your build.

1353
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
So with runewords, you're going to get to do that.

1354
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Each class is going to share two skills and one legendary aspect like the, uh, the earthquake one that you saw.

1355
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Um, and some of them are even going to get, get to cast improved versions.

1356
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:33,000
So for instance, you know, instead of, um, the standard decrepify from the necromancer, you get to cast horrid decrepify, which is the upgraded version.

1357
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And that's kind of, we did that for a lot of reasons.

1358
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
You know, we wanted to make some of them feel a little better and a little more powerful.

1359
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
And a lot of it is about balance.

1360
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:52,000
But one important thing that I always want to, um, highlight here is that you always cast the best version of the skill if you have upgrades as the sort of home owner of the class.

1361
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Right?

1362
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
So what that means is let's say you're a spirit born and you equip the cry rune, which is the vortex spell.

1363
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:04,000
If you have points into the upgrade, um, then you'll cast the upgraded vortex when the rune goes off.

1364
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
So I don't think there'll be any class envy.

1365
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:12,000
You know, like everyone will get the best version of their own skills and then they'll get to use other classes skills.

1366
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:20,000
And, um, we're really excited to see how people can construct new builds and new archetypes and what they can do with using the power of the classes.

1367
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
And that says enhanced war cry.

1368
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,000
So that means necros can become berserk, right?

1369
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
That indeed does mean that.

1370
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
And, uh, and, and that enhanced war cry is a winner.

1371
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I gotta say that one's real strong.

1372
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
We've already seen people just chopping up the pit with that one.

1373
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1374
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Uh, absolutely.

1375
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Really looking forward to what kind of interesting new combinations and builds you can come up with by, by dipping into other class skills, uh, in, in unique ways.

1376
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Uh, it really just like multiplies the possibilities of, of what you can do with any given class.

1377
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Yeah, exactly.

1378
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:02,000
And not only do we want you to augment your builds with other classes skills, but, you know, runes will scale with gear.

1379
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
So when you get more interesting runes of rituals, you'll find ways to optimize them as well and get more output.

1380
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:12,000
So we really feel like people will have a lot of theory crafting that they can build off of the runeword system.

1381
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
And I'm very excited to see how you break the game.

1382
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
By the way, that's what she's doing.

1383
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
She's doing PTR for me.

1384
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Just break, break the game.

1385
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
See every build you can find that totally destroys everything.

1386
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Um, so now we have the crafting element.

1387
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Um, so using three of the same rune, you can use them to roll a new rune.

1388
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Uh, you go to the jeweler or it might not be the jeweler, but we'll see.

1389
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Um, and you will combine three of the same exact rune and you'll get a new rune out that is guaranteed to be different than the rune you put in.

1390
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
And there's a chance to uproll it to the next highest rarity.

1391
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
So if you put three magic runes in, there's a chance that it'll be a rare rune.

1392
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Same with, same with rare.

1393
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
There's a chance that it'll be a legendary rune.

1394
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Um, and then on top of that, we'll have the ability to craft mythic uniques.

1395
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
So you can use runes.

1396
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Um, each route, each mythic unique can be crafted with a specific set of runes.

1397
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Um, you'll need a legendary rare and magic runes of a certain quantity and one resplendent spark.

1398
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,000
And this is in addition to the existing mythic unique crafting flow.

1399
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:17,000
So, um, yeah, uh, oh, I was just gonna say this really harkens back to the sort of crafting that was so core and deep.

1400
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Um, with the ruins of being able to match three and get the next upgrade, but in a way that's a little bit more flexible and gives you more progression out of it.

1401
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
And this is all tradable, right?

1402
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:34,000
So that match three, those crafting mythic uniques, what do you think that's gonna do with trading?

1403
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Yeah.

1404
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I mean, I, I think it's gonna really build a sort of player community around how to acquire the runes you need, whether it's because you want to combine, you know, you have two and you want to find that third one to combine.

1405
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
You're hunting for a new one or you're hunting for a specific mythic unique.

1406
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,000
I think we're gonna have a lot of player interaction and well, someone's gonna win the capitalism game there.

1407
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
So we'll see how that goes.

1408
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I really like how, how the, uh, the, the rune crafting system makes it.

1409
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
So you're kind of always progressing, right?

1410
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:12,000
If you're getting room drops, then, then you're, you're, you're getting materials that you know, can use to progress towards higher rarity runes and potentially towards these mythic unique items.

1411
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Unlike, uh, you know, some of the other loot drops, you know, if you don't find a good piece of gear, it just ends up being salvage.

1412
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Here with runes, you're kind of constantly getting some of that progression, even if it's not always the perfect rune right now.

1413
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Yeah, I think that's something that we, we did talk to a lot of sort of D2 diehards when we, we built rune words.

1414
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:37,000
And one of the things that most of them tend to mention consistently was like every rune drop is progress, right?

1415
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
You're always moving up that ladder.

1416
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:45,000
And so we wanted to make sure that even if you didn't get the exact thing you wanted, it still meant something to you one way or another.

1417
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Well, I know, uh, we have, we've talked a lot about a lot of stuff today.

1418
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
We, we had a progression itemization.

1419
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Uh, we talked about quality of life.

1420
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
We talked about class, uh, changes.

1421
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
And of course the newest thing, which is rune words, which will be in vessel of hatred.

1422
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Um, but the one thing we did want to quickly talk about was PTR.

1423
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
PTR is coming up.

1424
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Uh, and we want to give a little bit, or at least some specifics on what that PTR test is going to be.

1425
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:27,000
And also hear from the team on exactly like what they're looking for, uh, from you guys out there that are playing like for feedback, uh, as you guys play through the systems, everything that we've actually talked about today is going to be present in this PTR.

1426
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:35,000
So, uh, all the, uh, class balance changes, the progression changes, uh, rune words will also be part of, uh, the PTR.

1427
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
So we actually do want players jumping in, uh, and checking it out.

1428
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
So, uh, let's jump right into some of the PTR items.

1429
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:50,000
So, uh, as everyone knows, uh, PTR, uh, from even the last PTR that we had, uh, will carry over content from your main account.

1430
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:59,000
So if you've already done all your renown, cleared your fog of war, your altar of Lola status, uh, uh, status will carry over onto your PTR account.

1431
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Uh, we did do a character copy as well.

1432
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
It was a while back though.

1433
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:11,000
So, uh, there, there, you may find that it might be a little dated from like the character copy that you have on live, but, uh, that will exist later.

1434
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,000
So, uh, that will exist for players to actually use.

1435
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Um, one thing I will note is that we are planning on having two different testing phases for PTR specifically.

1436
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Uh, the first testing phase will actually begin next Wednesday.

1437
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Uh, and we'll run through Friday, uh, about midday where we're gonna actually give players the opportunity of kind of just starting characters from fresh, uh, because we really need people to try out the new progression systems that, uh, Colin and Hazelyn were talking about specifically in the beginning of the stream.

1438
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:56,000
So Wednesday through midday Friday, we really need players to jump in, check that out, give us feedback specifically, uh, regarding anything tied to the new progression systems.

1439
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:08,000
So, uh, around midday on Friday though, we will be turning on the rest of the PTR, which will include things like rune words and, and all the other, uh, features that we were kind of talking about, uh, are, well.

1440
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
All the other features will be part of it, but rune words and things like that will be turning in on Friday.

1441
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:21,000
One thing that we've heard from feedback from players specifically, especially as we have addressed this in the past is that there is going to be a boost vendor available for this PTR.

1442
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:32,000
So in Kyovishad players will be able to go and visit this specific vendor. This is the best video that I was talking about because this Fallen is dancing and it looks, it looks absolutely amazing.

1443
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Uh, this vendor will be available and you'll be able to interact with it. And this vendor will actually then be able to provide you a ton of, uh, uh, enhancements to your character, uh, which we do have a list of here.

1444
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Uh, so you will be able to boost your character up to level 50 level 60, of course, which is the new level cap after vessel of hatred actually ships.

1445
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Uh, we will end up clearing out your whole map, your waypoints, uh, fog of war. Uh, we will do your class mechanic stuff and have that already unlocked.

1446
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:15,000
All torment tears will be unlocked. Your potions will be, uh, upgraded completely. And then I know based off of feedback that we got from like the last PTR was, uh, hey, it'd be great if we could generate like, like,

1447
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:28,000
legendary items, if we can get all the unique items, all the runes, or, well, that's new now, but all the, the runes and everything like that, including master working materials that will actually be available in this vendor.

1448
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:37,000
So this is a way for players to be more efficient while testing and being able to give us, uh, more feedback, especially around end game related items.

1449
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Uh, so we really need players to jump in for PTR. One, one last caveat I do want to mention is, um,

1450
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Um, Infernal Hordes will not be available in this specific PTR. Uh, we are still doing some work on that right now, uh, before we actually get it ready, but, uh, all the other features within the game will be available.

1451
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Infernal Hordes, as I mentioned, will be, it's a permanent feature, so it's coming back to the game no matter what. Uh, and then separately, um, I, I do want to remind everyone that PTR right now is still just PC Battle.net only.

1452
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,000
This does give us the flexibility of being able to upload, change things on the fly.

1453
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Like things like turning, turning Rune words on, on Friday, for instance, is, uh, gives us, we have the flexibility of being able to do that on, on, uh, our own platform.

1454
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:33,000
So it's just easier for us to be able to have that, uh, additional, uh, work from our side to, to be able to make things like that happen when we can do testing specifically from that end.

1455
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Um, but Colin, Aislinn, uh, I'd be really curious to hear like what you guys are looking for specifically in this PTR from feedback from players, uh, that they can focus in on and provide feedback on, uh, as they go into the test.

1456
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Yeah.

1457
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
So I think we really want to see people focusing on the new journey.

1458
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:59,000
So starting from level one and feeling out what difficulty tier is right for you.

1459
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Um, and if that feels like it's the difficulty tier that you would expect to be on based on, uh, how powerful you've managed to make your character and how many of the progression systems you've engaged with.

1460
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Like if you engage with tempering and you go all out and you, you know, like, you're like, I'm going to make my character a blaster, even though they're only level 30, like how far can you go with that?

1461
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
And are you going as far as you expected you would be able to go?

1462
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Yeah, those are great points.

1463
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:34,000
It really is about, you know, are we hitting that expectation that we've sort of created, right?

1464
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Which is, we really loved how the mind cage was functioning.

1465
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
We loved how tormented bosses felt in terms of having hard mode versions of things.

1466
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Um, are these difficulty tiers sort of meeting those expectations of all the things that we have had in the previous game now mapped to a more streamlined system, um, that should be much, much easier to navigate.

1467
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Awesome.

1468
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
And I know on the class side, like Charles, what are you kind of looking for?

1469
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
What's the team looking for on that front?

1470
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Yeah, I think we're really looking at the new system.

1471
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:13,000
We're looking at the new skills and the new key passives for each class and, and how they're usable at, at all points in your character journey, right?

1472
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
They should feel good to press when you just first learn these new skills.

1473
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Um, but they should also feel really good when you're in the late game and you're trying to, you know, make, you make a build all around them, right?

1474
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Around your, your stone burst.

1475
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Like, does it feel like that has enough support and that you can, you know, make a stone burst build or, or dance of knives and, um, or all the other different skills.

1476
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Like, do they fit in?

1477
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
What's their appropriate power level?

1478
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:43,000
And, and we really want to make sure that the new skills and the new key passives, uh, enable new ways of playing our classes and that, and they feel satisfying to build that way.

1479
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Awesome.

1480
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,000
And Jeevan, I know you mentioned to everyone, break the game with RuneWords.

1481
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:55,000
So, is there any, maybe any more extra items you're looking for in terms of feedback?

1482
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's definitely mostly about that.

1483
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
I want to see what people come up with.

1484
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I want to see, you know, what you can cook in terms of build and you can do something fun or cool or unexpected.

1485
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,000
And, um, also, you know, I'm, I'm highly interested in the sort of balanced feedback.

1486
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I think we'll get it from all of you, but, um, we've had a lot of people on the team work very hard on conceptualizing how to make sure this stuff is right on the edge of broken without actually being broken.

1487
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
And you'll get to, you'll get to prove me wrong if that isn't the case.

1488
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Um, yep.

1489
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Awesome.

1490
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Well, I know, um, we do want to jump into a little bit of Q and A before we kind of wrap up.

1491
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:38,000
I know we've been here for a little while, so we'll try to grab some questions specifically from Twitch chat.

1492
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I know, uh, the, probably the most, uh, popular question right now, uh, from, from the community is about Armory.

1493
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:49,000
And I do want to start off with that specifically.

1494
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
And I do also want to just confirm that we are working on an Armory.

1495
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
It is, it, the, the team is cooking on it right now.

1496
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Uh, we just don't have it ready immediately, but soon as we have an update, um, we will be providing that, uh, to the community.

1497
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
There is work for an Armory happening.

1498
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
We're not purposely ignoring it.

1499
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I promise you.

1500
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Uh, and it, it, it is in the work specifically from that end.

1501
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,000
So, um, I know, uh, we, we have questions from Twitch chat.

1502
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
So this is where I actually like butcher everyone's name.

1503
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
So, uh, in standard fashion, I will continue to do that.

1504
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:32,000
It's just a little different now because I actually like have a, a screen in front of me, which is actually really, really beneficial.

1505
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Um, but I guess we'll start off with a question regarding, uh, the different difficulty tiers.

1506
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:48,000
So this is from double DHZ, which is, uh, since we now have eight difficulties, does this mean with power increase in later seasons, more difficulties will be added?

1507
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Wouldn't, uh, would, are we planning on adding, uh, like 20 difficulties like in Diablo three?

1508
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Like what, what's the plans around that?

1509
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Yeah, we want to be really measured in terms of when we add difficulty tiers.

1510
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Um, I think it sets us up for adding them when we feel like it's an inappropriate time.

1511
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,000
We don't want to get to a spot where we have 20 different difficulty tiers.

1512
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,000
We want to have just enough granularity to support the amount of power that we're adding.

1513
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:27,000
And what we don't want to do is sort of say, okay, we're going to add things like rune words or add things like seasonal powers and then nerf all of you by making the monsters 100% tankier to compensate for the power.

1514
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:35,000
We'd actually rather create a system that when you get that new power, we're going to add another band of difficulty to get even more efficiency out of that power.

1515
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Um, so that's been the sort of guiding light is we don't want to continue to sort of nerf players into a spot where they can sort of use all this new power to push.

1516
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Um, a great example of that is previously in seasons, we would actually increase monster health to compensate for some of the seasonal powers.

1517
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Now, if you get seasonal powers, if you're blasting Penitent and leveling to 60 faster, good for you.

1518
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Like that's something that we think is actually really important to the system.

1519
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Awesome. Um, I know next question that we have, this is a question I've seen a decent amount.

1520
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,000
This is from explosive cat. Hopefully your cat is not exploding.

1521
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Uh, what's the purpose of nightmare dungeons now that glyphs have moved out of pit?

1522
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Yeah. So nightmare dungeons are going to be where you receive your master working materials.

1523
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Um, and because nightmare dungeons are going to be following the, um, difficulty tier, uh, system now,

1524
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:42,000
you're going to be able to go into higher torment tiers or rather higher difficulty tier, uh, nightmare dungeons and get more, uh, masterwork materials out of that.

1525
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,000
So just like, you know, all other kinds of content in the game.

1526
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Now being able to go into a higher difficulty of that activity is going to ultimately be better for you.

1527
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Yeah. The grind sort of putting a grind currency actually fits much better in a nightmare dungeon compared to the pit,

1528
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:06,000
because it means that every sort of elite you kill every chest you open or every corner you go into and you find an elite pack.

1529
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Those are going to be master working materials as opposed to today where it's like, well,

1530
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,000
the instant I make a turn that is not in the direction of finishing this dungeon has been a waste of my time.

1531
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Cause I want that cliff that can play completely changes when everything in the dungeon is dropping master working materials.

1532
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,000
And we think that feels so much better for that type of content.

1533
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Um, conversely, you know, with the pit, uh, you know, again, we're going to reward you for pushing to the pit.

1534
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
We're going to reward you for pushing difficulty.

1535
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,000
And we do want you to sort of get there quickly and get that reward and get out.

1536
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
So we think that'll feel a lot better.

1537
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Yeah. So just, just for people, cause I think when they immediately heard like, well,

1538
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:46,000
now it's just moved to nightmare dungeons and it's just at the end, it's actually part of, of the, the, the, the whole nightmare dungeon.

1539
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:52,000
It's not just the end goal, getting to the end and do it and getting, you know, master working materials there.

1540
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Just want to clarify for chat.

1541
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Cause I know immediately there's a good amount.

1542
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,000
There's a good amount at the end when you kill the boss, right?

1543
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Of course the boss has to have good shit, but like, what's really going to feel great is like when you run into a massive elite pack,

1544
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
like you just randomly run into, you know, we, we spawned maybe too many.

1545
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Those are all going to represent, you know, little loot bags of master working materials, which is going to be huge.

1546
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Awesome.

1547
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Um, this question is from RxU 105.

1548
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Um, are runes reusable?

1549
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Um, yeah.

1550
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:34,000
So, um, by the way, I just want to say chat, I've, I've been reading, I've been reading Twitch chat and what you've said has, uh, struck a chord.

1551
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Anyway, um, yes, they will be reusable.

1552
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Oh, gee, man.

1553
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Can't take you anywhere.

1554
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Um, you could unsocket runes and you can, uh, move them into different items.

1555
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Yes, absolutely.

1556
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Um, I saw a few related questions to that.

1557
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Uh, they, they don't get to exist in the same, um, item as gems.

1558
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
You do have to pick between gems and, uh, runes on any individual item.

1559
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Awesome.

1560
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Um, I know there was a question related to, um, another, well, at least, I don't know.

1561
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I don't know if Charles, you want to answer this or if you have additional details.

1562
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:24,000
There's a lot of questions related to one of the mythic uniques and it's, uh, additive damage to demons and angels specifically.

1563
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Um, I don't know if you want to talk about it.

1564
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I will confirm that is the wording on the effect.

1565
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Plus damage to angels and demons.

1566
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
There you go, guys.

1567
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
We'll just leave it at that.

1568
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Um, and no further.

1569
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I know.

1570
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Yeah.

1571
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
No further comment on that.

1572
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Um, additional question that we have related to, uh, Paragon is why cap the amount of boards and instead of just capping maybe the amount of lifts we can use.

1573
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
This is from hot air.

1574
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Yeah, that's a really good point.

1575
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Um, something that I think we can take back and really think about.

1576
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:15,000
We had discussed and we felt like the cleanest solution from just sort of the, um, flow perspective was that we wanted to just make it really sort of compact and make those choices about which glyphs and which legendary nodes.

1577
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:19,000
And eventually what rare and magic nodes matter to you.

1578
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Um, but that's really good feedback and something we can continue to monitor as we go into PTR.

1579
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:32,000
And as people get their hands on it again, it's really about making those boards more punchy and the connections between those boards is something that you navigate during your journey.

1580
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,000
But the sort of end point is about making those really chunky choices on what glyphs you want and what legendary nodes you want.

1581
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Um, and we think that ultimately, especially now that Paragon is realm wide and all your alts.

1582
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
I think we touched on that earlier.

1583
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:48,000
All your alts get to benefit from this.

1584
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Um, it's really going to streamline that process of getting your points locked in quickly on those alt characters and get them into the end game really quickly.

1585
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Um, so, but that's a really good point of feedback.

1586
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Um, a question from.

1587
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
WTF I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I lack a lot of whatever.

1588
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
I see.

1589
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
This is, this is bad.

1590
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Yeah.

1591
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
You get the point.

1592
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Will everyone need to be in Kyovashad to change difficulty like it is currently?

1593
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
That's a good question.

1594
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
We've added, actually, yeah.

1595
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:27,000
So you could imagine how obnoxious it would be to do the pit in Karagar

1596
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:32,000
and then have to go to Kyovashad to then unlock the new Torment tier that you just got.

1597
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:36,000
So we actually added difficulty tier selectors in Karagar

1598
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,000
as well as Kyovashad in addition to Kyovashad.

1599
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:44,000
And then we also have one in Karast and there's also another one,

1600
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
I think, near the dark citadel entrance.

1601
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,000
We've added them in a few locations across the game

1602
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
just to make that a little bit of a better experience.

1603
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,000
A question from a few people.

1604
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
There's like Korinter.

1605
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
There's another question from Nine Tons of Pain.

1606
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Are lists kind of shared between all characters in the realm

1607
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
or do they have to be leveled up separately?

1608
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:10,000
So those are still leveled up separately,

1609
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
but that's something like going forward,

1610
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,000
we definitely want an emphasis on like making alts more seamless to play into.

1611
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:20,000
And we definitely, there's some underlying feedback there,

1612
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,000
which is, wouldn't it be great if the Paragon lists for account wide?

1613
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:26,000
And it's like, yeah, that's something we can take back to the team.

1614
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
And philosophically, you know,

1615
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
we really want to start moving towards a direction

1616
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,000
where making alts is really easy to get into and feel powerful.

1617
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
So that's something we can definitely take note of.

1618
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
And I'll also highlight that, right,

1619
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,000
because the Paragon points are shared account wide

1620
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
or realm wide, as it were,

1621
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
if you make a new character,

1622
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
you're going to get a ton of Paragon points right away,

1623
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
which increases your player power level,

1624
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
which maybe means you take on a higher pit tier

1625
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
and then you get the catch-up mechanic on leveling up those glifts.

1626
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
So it is a little bit easier for your alts to level up those glifts as well,

1627
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
even if it's not 100% shared.

1628
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Yeah, that's very true.

1629
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
You can level them up really fast in the pit if you're pushing deep.

1630
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
There is a question regarding Eternal Realm characters,

1631
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
and what happens to them when 2.0 kind of launches?

1632
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
What's the, like, do,

1633
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I'm assuming because they already have, like, 925 gear,

1634
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
if they're at max level,

1635
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
they'll be brought down to that new eye level that we had mentioned.

1636
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Is there, like, any specific changes or anything,

1637
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
or is it kind of laid out exactly kind of how we presented?

1638
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Oh, I can answer this.

1639
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Yeah.

1640
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Yeah.

1641
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:47,000
So we are doing some adjustments for those Eternal players

1642
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
who really like to play the game on one character.

1643
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
We wanted to make sure that there was new loot to chase.

1644
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:57,000
We also just needed to make sure that with the new character level adjustments,

1645
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
you know, we sort of had to adjust the eye power of items

1646
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,000
now that the fact that the max character level is 60.

1647
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:07,000
In addition to our goals of really sort of creating more grounded numbers,

1648
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
it does mean level 50 is getting an eye power adjustment

1649
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
as well as the affixes are being adjusted.

1650
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:17,000
But we are going to max roll every single affix that we adjusted power-wise.

1651
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
So, for example, if you get a 5,

1652
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
we're going to take those items and adjust them.

1653
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
We aren't going to re-roll those affix bands.

1654
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Like, if you had perfect affixes,

1655
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
we're just going to essentially max roll all of them within that band

1656
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
so there's no feels bad about, you know, I had this perfect item

1657
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
and you ruined it by readjusting it.

1658
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
But the sort of main takeaway there is

1659
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
we wanted to make sure in patch 2.0 that there was new loot to chase.

1660
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
You know, we wanted to make sure that the new uniques had a place to sing

1661
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
and that's all sort of in service to that

1662
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,000
for that type of Eternal player who really likes that sort of long-form progression.

1663
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Awesome.

1664
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
A question from Ice Panther.

1665
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Rumors, are they applicable to all items and weapons

1666
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
or are they restricted to specific types of equipment?

1667
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Additionally, can gems be inserted into equipment with runes?

1668
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Yeah, they can be inserted into all types of equipment

1669
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,000
so they're not restricted from being in uniques

1670
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
as long as, you know, you have two sockets for that unique.

1671
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:20,000
And to restate the slots that are available with two sockets,

1672
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
on base game it's three.

1673
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
It's chest, pants, and two-hander.

1674
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,000
We're also adding a second socket to helm so you'll have four slots.

1675
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,000
And you cannot mix runes with gems in any item.

1676
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
And you wouldn't want to.

1677
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
You'd basically be losing the benefit of them.

1678
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Awesome.

1679
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,000
I know we have some questions related to, like, some co-op bugs.

1680
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I will say that I've gone on, I know, like, forums and Reddit

1681
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:52,000
and addressed, at least addressed them that we are working on them.

1682
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I can tell you the team is most definitely working on them right now.

1683
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Excuse me as I call.

1684
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Still getting over my sickness.

1685
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
And then I know this is actually a pretty,

1686
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
I'm going to ask this because it's a funny question.

1687
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Are there runes for G and then Bun?

1688
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Oh, I mean, my narcissism certainly would have let me do that.

1689
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:19,000
But I think we can't do that sort of stuff, unfortunately.

1690
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I would have loved to.

1691
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
But I will say, there are, you know,

1692
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
the runes have these sort of phrases that they unlock

1693
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
when you actually compose the spells.

1694
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,000
And we have some, I think, fun references and Easter eggs

1695
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
to, you know, the great Diablo games of the past.

1696
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,000
And so hopefully that'll kind of make you smile when you see them.

1697
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Awesome.

1698
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
And then runes, are they stackable?

1699
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Yeah, they are stackable.

1700
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,000
And we have added a new tab for them as well.

1701
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
We have a socketable tab.

1702
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
So all your runes and gems will go there.

1703
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
There we go.

1704
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
It would be pretty good for your inventory.

1705
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Yeah, that would have been really messing with inventory

1706
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
if runes did not stack.

1707
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
And now they have their own tab.

1708
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Yeah, and now they have their own tab,

1709
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:09,000
which is really, really good.

1710
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:10,000
So cool.

1711
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I know we are very over on time.

1712
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,000
So I do want to make sure that we let everyone go here

1713
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,000
so that they can eat,

1714
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,000
because we've now gone well past lunch over here in California.

1715
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Just a reminder for everyone that PTR is actually going to be starting next Wednesday.

1716
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:37,000
We will have patch notes in the blog up immediately after the stream, specifically here.

1717
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
So you guys can check it out.

1718
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Check out the patch notes.

1719
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
It's 17,000 words.

1720
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
A lot of words.

1721
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,000
So I apologize.

1722
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:51,000
I will say that for other locales, it might be until early next week before those patch notes will be available.

1723
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
It just takes a while for us to localize on some of those, and it kind of came in a little hot.

1724
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,000
So we do plan on actually having that available in all languages.

1725
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Just for now, they will be English only and immediately up after this specific stream.

1726
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Again, PTR starts next Wednesday.

1727
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
We'll have two different phases.

1728
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Wednesday through Friday will be that first initial phase where we need players jumping in,

1729
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
checking out the progression changes, and testing all that out.

1730
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:20,000
And then starting on Friday for the rest of the week specifically,

1731
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,000
we'll end up having the boost vendor available where players can actually jump in

1732
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:33,000
and test out everything that they need to regarding rune words and all other things that are tied to Endgame.

1733
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I do want to give a huge thanks to everyone on this panel here.

1734
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Colin, Aislinn, Charles, Jeevan, thank you so much for going through a ton of information.

1735
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:51,000
I do want to also call out the rest of the Diablo team because they have been doing a ton of work towards Vessel of Hatred

1736
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
and, of course, Patch 2.0 and Season 6.

1737
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:59,000
One thing we will say is that you guys actually haven't heard about Season 6 yet.

1738
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,000
We still have information to tell you about Season 6.

1739
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,000
We'll be sharing that more here in the coming weeks as we head towards launch.

1740
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:14,000
So there is still a seasonal theme and mechanic with Season 6 that we'll be sharing here soon.

1741
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,000
So thank you guys, everyone, and thank you Diablo community for tuning in.

1742
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:23,000
