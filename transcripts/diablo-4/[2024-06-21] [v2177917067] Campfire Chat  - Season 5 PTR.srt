1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Season 4 is going to be the biggest update we have ever made to Diablo 4 since it has launched.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Our focus on Season 4 is to really make a lot of evergreen updates to the core systems of Diablo 4.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In Season 4, we're ramping the intensity across the Seasonal and Eternal realms through a collection of new activities

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
aimed at ensuring the moment-to-moment gameplay experience is as exciting and rewarding

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
when Hal comes to Sanctuary.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Season 4 item changes are some of the biggest changes we've made to Diablo 4 thus far.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We've never done anything like this.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We are fundamentally changing how you engage with items, how you upgrade them,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and along the way, solving a lot of things that we've seen continually from our community

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that we agree with are pain points of our existing item system right now.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So in this new itemization system, we're focusing on narrowing down the scope of the base affixes.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
They're going to be a lot simpler, they're going to be fewer in number,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so you can much more easily parse whether this item is useful for you,

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and if it is, then you can take it and further upgrade it and customize it to your own specific build.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Tempering is a new system that allows you to really customize the gear that you find.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
In order to temper, you will need to go to the Blacksmith

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and then choose the recipe that you wish to temper from,

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and then a random affix from that recipe will be attached onto your gear.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Tempering recipes can be found from almost all of the content throughout Sanctuaries.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So you will actually be looking for tempering recipes that go directly with what you're envisioning.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Maybe you're thinking, I'm going to play a Frost Sorceress.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There are also going to be recipes that are more generic

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and maybe are just generally good for the Sorceress,

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but you'll be able to choose which one you think is going to be most powerful

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
with the build you're making for your class.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're making a pretty radical change to the Codex of Power in this season.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Based again on the feedback that has been coming from our players.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now, every single Legendary in the game will be entered into your Codex of Power

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
so that you can continually imprint the best possible version of that Legendary onto your gear.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So going forward, there will no longer be carrying around all of these Aspect Crystals in your inventory.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's all going to be in the Codex of Power.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So part of the final system that we have is going to be greater affixes.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What's a greater affix?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, we want to keep it compelling that there are some drops that are even better than the others

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
when you're trying to get the perfect build at endgame.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Because of this, in World Tier 4 and only in World Tier 4,

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
when an Ancestral Legendary item drops,

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
there's a chance the affixes on it can roll as greater affixes.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
These will roll with bigger values that are normally available for that affix.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Greater affixes are fairly rare, but they're not impossible to find.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
While leveling up, you're going to be able to find upgrades much more easily with this new system.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Another part of itemization is going to be masterworking.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now, this is something really intended for that very high endgame, again, World Tier 4.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is where a player is going to take an item,

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
already has the affixes that they want on it,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but now they go through a process of upgrading those affixes,

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
getting even higher values on them.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Masterworking really starts at level 100.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Once you've already completed your build and found some of the best items,

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
you're going to be able to test your build against the powerful enemies of the pit.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The pit is a new endgame system that has been added in this season

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that is going to challenge players that feel that they have largely maximized their build.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
By pushing into more difficult tiers of the pit,

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you're going to be able to unlock rarer crafting materials

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to masterwork your gear even further.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're going to have to play some of the hardest content in the game,

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but once you do, if you're successful,

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you can go and make those affixes even stronger.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In Season 4, we're ramping the intensity of the Helltides

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
through the inclusion of a variety of new activities,

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
the first of which is a doubling down and rise of the cultists' presence throughout the tide.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're going to be running through the Helltides,

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
seeing the cultists just conjuring up swarms and swarms of demons,

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
adding to that sense of mannequin chaos that they're pretty well known for.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The other archetype that we're adding is the presence of the Doomsayers,

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
who were unfortunate enough to be caught out in the tide

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and basically just lost their minds to all of the mania going on around them.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And lastly, rounding out the new activities are just the inclusion of the Iron Wolves.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They're finally joining the fight.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They could no longer stand in the sidelines,

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
seeing the Helltides and Hells forces intensify their assault on Sanctuary.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
As Season 4 players engage and progress through the Call of the Wolves seasonal activity,

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
they'll earn honor with the Iron Wolves,

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
unlocking access to a vast assortment of rewards

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
to accompany and empower your Season 4 journeys.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
In the updated Helltide, for players who are able to stay alive long enough,

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
they'll be paid a visit by the Hellborn,

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
former heroes of Sanctuary who have aligned with the forces of Hell

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
to attack the allies they once aligned with.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Players who are able to take down the Hellborn

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
will be acquiring the materials they need

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to engage with the new premier Helltide activity,

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
the Accursed Rituals.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Located in the Helltide,

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
these Accursed Rituals are pretty much just botched rituals from the cultists

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
that players will be kick-starting for themselves,

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
drawing the intention of all the nearby Helltide monsters

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
in this kind of all-out battle.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
One of my favorite themes for these ambushes is the Hellworm.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's literally a giant Hell slug beast

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
that emerges from the ground

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and spews out a whole bunch of mobs at you.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you're able to survive that,

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
you'll be paid a visit from the Blood Maiden,

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
our brand new Helltide mini-boss

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and one of the ultimate challenges in the new experience.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So I think I'm actually most excited about this season

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
because of what you're able to do with your old characters,

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
how they can integrate with this new item game

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and take them to new levels of power with this system.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think that the best part of this update

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
is that you're going to be really empowered

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
to build the character that you want to play.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're going to be able to pick custom affixes

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and enhance your character in a lot of new and interesting ways.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Happy Friday, Diablo community.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Welcome to another Diablo 4 Campfire Chat.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I am Adam Fletcher.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm joined here by a very familiar face,

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mr. Adam Jackson.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hello, hello.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The Adams have invaded.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We did it. We won.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We have taken over.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We actually are joined by one additional person,

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and this person is tuning in, patching in?

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't know what the...

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Phoning in? I don't know.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
From Albany, Blizzard Albany,

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and that's Mr. Dan Tanguay.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Dan, would you like to introduce yourself?

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, sure thing.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hi, I'm Dan Tanguay,

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and I'm one of the lead seasons designers for Diablo 4,

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and yeah, we've got a lot of exciting stuff to share with you.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Awesome.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Great to hear from Dan.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Dan is kind of like melting in Albany.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I believe it's very, very warm up there.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's actually warmer there than California,

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
which is kind of crazy.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It is, yeah.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Look at this.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Adam and Adam.

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Ooh, I love it.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We did it.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No more Joes.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, no more Joes.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Where's Joe Pipera?

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Not here.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He's actually on vacation,

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
so that's the reason why he's not here.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But we have a lot to talk about today.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We are actually going to be talking about Season 5 in the PTR,

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and we do want to, like, you know,

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
there's been a lot going on with Diablo 4

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
over the last couple of months.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Obviously, Season 4 has launched.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We had our mid-season update last week.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We introduced pets, which is really cool.

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just random other band pets.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Just no one expected it,

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
but we did introduce pets within Season 4,

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and at the same time,

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
we also had our release date announcement

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
for Vessel of Hatred,

157
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
which is October 8th.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So lots and lots and lots of cool stuff

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
that's going on with Diablo 4,

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and we have more to share today.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But, of course, with PTR,

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
we do need to talk, like,

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
a little bit of the housekeeping stuff

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to make sure that players are aware of it

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and when it's going to start.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Currently, we have Season 5 PTR

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
actually starting next Tuesday,

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and that is on the 25th.

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It will run for one week,

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
similar to the Season 4 PTR.

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It is PC Battle.net only again.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It is just easier for us

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
to be able to get builds up

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and get things out

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and get feedback in really quickly

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
when we have it on PC Battle.net.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So that will be going live next Tuesday.

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Everything that we're talking about today

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
will be in a blog

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that will go live after the stream,

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
as well as patch notes

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
will be going live after the stream,

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and they're pretty beefy in themselves.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's Friday, you guys.

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We haven't done a Friday stream in...

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't know.

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's been a while.

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's been a long while.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
For feedback, though,

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
we will be opening up our PTR forums

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
for players to actually be able to submit feedback.

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So the Diablo 4 forums

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
will have a special section for PTR.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And then separately,

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
if you do want to leave feedback

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
on other avenues,

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
such as like Reddit

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
or the Community Sanctuary Discord,

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
places like that,

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
we most definitely end up

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
combing through

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
all the different various ways

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
of players being able to provide feedback

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
specifically from that end.

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
For this PTR,

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
we will note that

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
this one will be a little different

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
than Season 4

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
in regards to how you can start off characters.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There will still be character boosts

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
like what we had with the Season 4 PTR.

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I believe it's actually moved

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
to a different city.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I can't recall.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think we had it in Kiovashod before,

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and I believe it's in a different city,

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and I don't recall

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
which city it is.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's in the blog, though.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But all that information

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
will be there after the stream.

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Separately,

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
we did incorporate

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
a character copy feature,

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but we initiated

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
this character copy already.

227
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No one knows this,

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
but as of yesterday,

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
characters were copied

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
from your accounts

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
over to PTR,

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
so it gives you

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
a little bit of variety

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
of being able to take over

235
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
some of those characters

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
that you've already built out.

237
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Or, you know,

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
if you want to,

239
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
you can still use

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the character boost.

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I will note,

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
we do want players

243
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to be experiencing it

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
in a variety of ways,

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
like whether using

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
your current characters

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that we're copying over,

248
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
or if you're using

249
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
some of the character boosts,

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
we do recommend,

251
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
or if you want to level up

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to level one,

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
like that's another option

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
as well.

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It allows us to get feedback

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
from all different aspects,

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
so we do recommend,

258
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
you know,

259
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
trying it out

260
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
in different ways

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and providing feedback

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
of like how things feel,

263
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
how things flow

264
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
within the PTR itself.

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So that is all

266
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
kind of like the general

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
housekeeping notes

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
that we do have.

269
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, and I will say that

270
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I believe we actually did,

271
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
we did correct that

272
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Codex of Power reset thing

273
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
as well.

274
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, okay.

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So yeah,

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I remember that was

277
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
plaguing some people

278
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
last season.

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We did correct that,

280
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
so it won't reset,

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I believe,

282
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
every single time

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you end up like creating

284
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
a new character

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
or boosting a new character,

286
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I believe.

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And then separately,

288
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,000
on the forums,

289
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
we will have a known issues list

290
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
because they're,

291
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
you know,

292
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
it's PTR,

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
it's an early build,

294
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
so we want to make sure

295
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
that people are aware of that.

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And with PTR,

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you know,

298
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
when we take in feedback,

299
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
it's great for players

300
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
to be able to like provide

301
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
all various forms of feedback.

302
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I will say,

303
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
by the time Season 5 launches,

304
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
we will try our best

305
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
to get as much

306
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
of that feedback in.

307
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If it's something

308
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that's like a massive,

309
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
like, oh,

310
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
like a huge overhaul

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
or something like that,

312
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I wouldn't expect it

313
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
in Season 5,

314
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
but it is good

315
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
to hear that feedback

316
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
because it might be something

317
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
that we end up incorporating

318
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
maybe in the future

319
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
for like a future season

320
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
from that end.

321
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah,

322
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
it's very useful.

323
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So it helps us drive

324
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,000
future decisions

325
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and even,

326
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
we did a lot of reaction

327
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
to PTR feedback

328
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
in Season 4,

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
if I remember right.

330
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We did like a whole lot

331
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
on our team at least

332
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and I expect the same

333
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
for Season 5,

334
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
so.

335
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Exactly.

336
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Send it in,

337
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
it's very useful.

338
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And then one last thing

339
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I do want to note is

340
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
because players have probably seen

341
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
when Season 4 is ending,

342
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
which is currently

343
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
in early August,

344
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
you can see that kind of like

345
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
on your character select screen

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
when you're jumping

347
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
into the game.

348
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I will note that Season 5

349
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
is a little bit shorter

350
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,000
of a season

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
than what we've had beforehand.

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Season 5 itself

353
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
will run until

354
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
that October 8th date

355
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
with Vessel of Hatred

356
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
because Vessel of Hatred

357
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,000
is actually the start

358
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
of Season 6.

359
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So we did want to

360
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
at least clarify,

361
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
make sure,

362
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,000
because we've heard

363
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
a lot of those questions

364
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
of like,

365
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,000
hey,

366
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
is Vessel of Hatred

367
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
hitting in the middle

368
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
of Season 5?

369
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Things like that.

370
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So we did want to note

371
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
that from that end.

372
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But enough of the

373
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
housekeeping notes.

374
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I know a lot of players

375
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
want to hear about

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Season 5 in itself.

377
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And so Mr. Dan Tanguay

378
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
from the sweltering

379
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
city limits of Albany

380
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
will be walking us

381
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
through Season 5.

382
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, absolutely.

383
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So yeah,

384
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
let's dive into the new features

385
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
on PTR for Season 5.

386
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Just to give you

387
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
a little bit of context,

388
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you know,

389
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
we did some early

390
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
brainstorming for Season 5

391
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and we knew that,

392
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you know,

393
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
we needed to build out

394
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
the endgame.

395
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So endgame,

396
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
you know,

397
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
we've heard y'all

398
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that endgame is very important.

399
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And Season 4,

400
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,000
we added the pit

401
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
into the endgame

402
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and some people

403
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
have been playing

404
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Helltides into the endgame.

405
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But we still want to expand

406
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
the endgame a bit more,

407
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,000
right?

408
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So if it's an endgame activity,

409
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
we definitely need something

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
that's rewarding

411
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and very replayable.

412
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We also wanted to make something

413
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
with a lot of monsters.

414
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I mean,

415
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
monster density

416
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and just entering

417
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
that feeling of flow state

418
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
is really important

419
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,000
for players.

420
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We needed something

421
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
that had stakes

422
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and we wanted players

423
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
to push their luck.

424
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And finally,

425
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
we really wanted

426
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to return to Hell.

427
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You know,

428
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
previous Diablo games

429
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
let you return to Hell

430
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
after you defeat

431
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,000
the big boss,

432
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
but Diablo 4

433
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,000
hadn't done that yet.

434
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And so with all

435
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
those goals in mind,

436
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
let me introduce you

437
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to the Infernal Hordes.

438
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Now,

439
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
let me give you

440
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
a quick summary

441
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
of what the Infernal Hordes is.

442
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's a wave-based

443
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
gameplay mode

444
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
with survivor-like choices

445
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
in between the waves

446
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and it'll culminate

447
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,000
with an all-new

448
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
boss encounter

449
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and then the rewards

450
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
build on top

451
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
of Itemization 2.0

452
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
that came in Season 4.

453
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So,

454
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,000
now how do you go about

455
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
confronting the Internal Hordes?

456
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
How do you get back to Hell?

457
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think we can queue up

458
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
some footage

459
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
and then I'll talk you

460
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
through some of the ways

461
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
you get back to Hell.

462
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
All right.

463
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,000
First off,

464
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you're going to unlock,

465
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,000
you know,

466
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
the activity for Hell

467
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
with a brisk Eternal questline

468
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
starting at World Tier 3

469
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
in Zarbenzet.

470
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's where you need

471
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
to go in the PTR.

472
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Now,

473
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
you need a new type of key

474
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
called a compass,

475
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
which you can see down

476
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
in the inventory below here.

477
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And like Nightmare Dungeons,

478
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
the compasses all have

479
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
a starting monster difficulty

480
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and a number of revives.

481
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And there are eight levels

482
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
of difficulty

483
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
with escalating challenge

484
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and rewards.

485
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
As you can see,

486
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
it's a very Nightmare Dungeon-like

487
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
flow here.

488
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And then compasses

489
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
can be upgraded

490
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
to higher tiers

491
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
with all new consumables

492
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
called Abyssal Scrolls.

493
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So,

494
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you'll get a chance

495
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to play with all these

496
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,000
new features

497
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
when you're in the PTR.

498
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But,

499
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
let's really talk about

500
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
the gameplay itself.

501
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I think we've got

502
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,000
some footage

503
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
of the wave-based play

504
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
that we can show off here.

505
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
First off,

506
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
going to have a lot of monsters.

507
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Now,

508
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you have one monster here.

509
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is the start of wave one.

510
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And so,

511
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you defeat this

512
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Aether Fiend

513
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and it's going to drop

514
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
something called

515
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Burning Aether,

516
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
which is a new currency.

517
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Now,

518
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
this new currency

519
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
is specific to hell

520
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and you use it

521
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
to unlock the spoils

522
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,000
of hell

523
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
at the end of a run.

524
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And at the end

525
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
of each wave,

526
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
there's going to be

527
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
what's called

528
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
the Infernal Offer.

529
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So,

530
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
let's get through this wave

531
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and we'll take a look

532
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
at the Infernal Offer.

533
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Now,

534
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
you see these hands

535
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
reaching out from hell itself

536
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and they're tempting you

537
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
with a choice.

538
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You're going to choose

539
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the form of your destructor.

540
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're going to pick

541
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
a boon and a bane

542
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
that impacts

543
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
the rest of your run.

544
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And so,

545
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
now you've chosen

546
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
a boon and a bane

547
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and

548
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
that's going to modify

549
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the gameplay

550
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
that comes up next.

551
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And so,

552
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,000
here,

553
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000
you're jumping into

554
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
one of the new activities

555
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
that also unlocks

556
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Aether in this.

557
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And this is a soul spire.

558
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's pretty similar

559
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
to a hell spire

560
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,000
that you'd see

561
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
in Helltide.

562
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And you have to kill

563
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
a number of enemies

564
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
within that ring

565
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,000
in order to be able

566
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to earn an Aether.

567
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And you can upgrade soul spires

568
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
from the Infernal Offer

569
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,000
as well,

570
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
if you like.

571
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And then,

572
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
finally,

573
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
what you need to do

574
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
is complete the number

575
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,000
of waves

576
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
in order to be able

577
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
to confront the boss.

578
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And so,

579
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you see,

580
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
in this particular run,

581
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you're at five of five waves.

582
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So,

583
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you are just about ready

584
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
once you defeat this wave

585
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
to go confront

586
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
the new bosses

587
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
for the Infernal Hordes.

588
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So,

589
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
we'll finish collecting

590
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
our Aether here,

591
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
find our last number

592
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,000
of enemies,

593
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and I think we're good.

594
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think we're ready to go.

595
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So,

596
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
let's take a look

597
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,000
at our new bosses.

598
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think we've got

599
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
some cool art

600
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
to share here.

601
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So,

602
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
these are the Fel Council.

603
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They're going to be

604
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
some familiar faces

605
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
for Diablo II players.

606
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They are resurrected versions

607
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
of the council members

608
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
from Diablo II.

609
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Now,

610
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,000
for those of you

611
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
who didn't play Diablo II,

612
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the council members

613
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
were former high priests

614
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
of the Zacarum,

615
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and they had promised

616
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
to basically

617
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
take care of Mephisto

618
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
after he'd been trapped

619
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
in the Soul Stone,

620
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and he'd been hidden down

621
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and caressed

622
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and trabencal.

623
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And,

624
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
of course,

625
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
as it happens,

626
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Mephisto corrupted them,

627
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
both in mind first

628
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and then their bodies,

629
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and they became demons

630
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
who are just zealous

631
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and serve him

632
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
without question.

633
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And so,

634
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
we thought it was

635
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
going to be really cool

636
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
to be able to resurrect them

637
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and bring them back

638
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
for Diablo IV,

639
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and they fit great in hell.

640
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We had to tweak

641
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
their power sets

642
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
a little bit

643
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
to fit the D4 combat system,

644
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
so we gave them

645
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,000
new titles

646
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and new looks

647
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
to really reflect

648
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
their combat specialties.

649
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah,

650
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
it's incredibly awesome

651
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,000
to see

652
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
these guys come back.

653
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You know,

654
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,000
it's giving

655
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
very nostalgic

656
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
vibes

657
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
of doing

658
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,000
a bunch of,

659
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you know,

660
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
endurance of hate runs

661
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
for Mephisto

662
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and doing Meph runs

663
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and everything like that.

664
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So, yeah,

665
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,000
it's really awesome

666
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to see him back

667
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
in Season 5.

668
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah,

669
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I agree.

670
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Diablo II

671
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
is certainly near

672
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and dear to our hearts

673
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
here out in New York.

674
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And,

675
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,000
yeah,

676
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,000
we're really glad

677
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
to have him back,

678
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and we hope to see

679
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
hopefully more returning

680
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,000
new faces

681
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in the future, too.

682
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So,

683
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
let's take a look

684
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
at that boss encounter now.

685
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So,

686
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I showed you

687
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
a number of

688
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
members of the

689
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Fel Council here.

690
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We've actually built

691
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
five of them in total,

692
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
but you're only going

693
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
to fight three at a time.

694
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Now,

695
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
we keep two

696
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,000
in the hopper,

697
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
basically,

698
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and we do that

699
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
because we want

700
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
to have a whole bunch

701
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
of replay associated

702
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
with this boss fight.

703
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And because we're only

704
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
using three of the five,

705
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,000
there's actually

706
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
ten variations

707
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
of this boss fight

708
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,000
that you can fight

709
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
randomly

710
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
as you do

711
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
your infernal run.

712
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And so,

713
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,000
we're going to

714
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
basically kill them off.

715
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And

716
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
once you defeat one,

717
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
the fight

718
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
will actually escalate.

719
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Actually,

720
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
it probably escalates

721
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
even if you just

722
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,000
take down

723
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
a certain amount

724
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,000
of health,

725
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
if I remember correctly.

726
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And

727
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
it escalates.

728
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Basically,

729
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,000
their attacks

730
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
become more powerful,

731
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and then they start

732
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,000
really getting

733
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
even more powerful

734
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
kind of room-clearing

735
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
attacks towards the end.

736
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But we've defeated

737
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
them here,

738
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
and this is the reward

739
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,000
moment I actually

740
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
wanted to talk through

741
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,000
with you,

742
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,000
because this is something

743
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
that really ties

744
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
into itemization 2.0.

745
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You've got several

746
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
chests here,

747
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and you've got a choice

748
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
of the rewards

749
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
you get at the end

750
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
of your infernal run.

751
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You can choose

752
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,000
from a chest

753
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that contains

754
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
all new legendaries

755
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and new uniques.

756
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You can choose

757
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,000
from a chest

758
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
that contains

759
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,000
all sorts of

760
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
crafting materials,

761
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
including

762
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
masterworking materials,

763
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
so you don't need

764
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to go to the pit

765
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
anymore exclusively

766
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
to get masterworking

767
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,000
materials.

768
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You've got a chest

769
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that allows you

770
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,000
just to get

771
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
a whole bunch of gold.

772
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I know people out there

773
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
are really asking for gold,

774
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and this is going to be

775
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,000
a good source of it.

776
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And finally,

777
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
even though it wasn't

778
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,000
shown here,

779
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you have a chest

780
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
that guarantees

781
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
a single item

782
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
with a greater

783
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
affects on it.

784
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And so we thought

785
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
we'd want to try this out

786
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and see how people

787
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
respond to it,

788
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and we thought

789
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
it would be pretty exciting.

790
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You know,

791
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
certainly in Season 4,

792
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm really trying

793
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
to get some more

794
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
greater affectses,

795
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
so I'd love

796
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,000
to have this

797
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
in Season 5.

798
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So yeah,

799
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
let's take a closer look

800
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,000
at some of the uniques

801
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
you can farm

802
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
from the Infernal Horde

803
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
since we're talking

804
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
about rewards already.

805
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,000
So we're going to

806
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
queue up some footage here.

807
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So first up,

808
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
we've got the Basilisk.

809
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And so this is going

810
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
to be a new unique

811
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
staff for Druids.

812
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And so when you hit

813
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
an enemy with a nurse skill,

814
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
it'll petrify them

815
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and deal physical damage.

816
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So turning the monsters

817
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
to stone,

818
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
always cool.

819
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But it's also cool

820
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that you can CC

821
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,000
your target

822
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and boost

823
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
your initial attack here.

824
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So this one's

825
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,000
pretty exciting

826
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
for you Druid players

827
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
out there.

828
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,000
All right,

829
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
next up,

830
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
we've got the Third Blade.

831
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Now this is a unique sword

832
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
for Barbarians.

833
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This one makes

834
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
your Weapon Mastery skills

835
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
be treated as core skills

836
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that cost Fury.

837
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Even though they deal

838
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
a little reduced damage,

839
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
this one's pretty exciting

840
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
because now you can start

841
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
making all sorts

842
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,000
of new builds

843
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that you've never seen before.

844
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So we're really interested

845
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
to see what the community

846
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
comes up with here.

847
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
All right,

848
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000
next up,

849
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
we've got the Mordicrux.

850
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Now the Mordicrux

851
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
is a new unique dagger

852
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,000
for Necros.

853
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So when you consume a corpse,

854
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
there's a chance

855
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
that you'll create

856
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
a skeletal simulacrum

857
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that seeks out enemies.

858
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And when it dies,

859
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,000
it explodes.

860
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So essentially,

861
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
you're making a skele bomb

862
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
when you consume corpses.

863
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And so that's just going

864
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
to seek out targets

865
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and explode.

866
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think that'd be pretty handy

867
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
for my Necro this season.

868
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So I'm looking forward

869
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
to that one too.

870
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Next up,

871
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
we have the Mordicrux.

872
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Now the Mordicrux

873
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
is a new unique dagger

874
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
for rogues.

875
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So if you use

876
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
a Cetrifuge skill,

877
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
you'll create a totem.

878
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And if you hit that totem

879
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
with an attack,

880
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
it replicates any of the damage

881
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
it takes to all nearby enemies.

882
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And so it's a great way

883
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
for essentially replicating

884
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and doubling down

885
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
on the damage

886
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that you're dealing

887
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
in a particular area.

888
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
All right.

889
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Next up,

890
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
we've got the Vox Omnium.

891
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Now the Vox Omnium

892
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
is a new unique staff

893
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,000
for Sorx.

894
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And so when you cast

895
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
a core skill,

896
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
it's going to cast

897
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
an additional

898
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
two basic projectiles

899
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
based on the previous

900
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
elements used.

901
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And so this allows you

902
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
to really start comboing

903
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
your core and basic skills together.

904
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And if you decide

905
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
to have different elements

906
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
associated with those

907
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
core and basic skills,

908
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
now you can start

909
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
casting fire

910
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and lightning

911
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and cold

912
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
all at the same time.

913
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So we're pretty excited

914
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
about this one too.

915
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And the final one

916
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
we're going to share out here

917
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
is actually a new set of boots

918
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
that's available

919
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
for all classes.

920
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And these are called

921
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Rackinof's Wake.

922
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And so whenever you use

923
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
an ability with a cooldown,

924
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
you'll trigger

925
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
tongue twister,

926
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
trigger an explosion

927
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
dealing fire damage.

928
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And so really,

929
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
it's pretty straightforward.

930
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You're going to bathe

931
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
your enemies in flames

932
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
whenever you use

933
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
a cooldown skill.

934
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So maybe I'm going to

935
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
dust off my whirlwind barb

936
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
here and slap them on

937
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and see how it does.

938
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So yeah,

939
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
these are some

940
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,000
of the uniques

941
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and legendaries

942
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
that are going in

943
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
to the infernal hordes.

944
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I think there are

945
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
10 uniques overall

946
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and over 20 legendaries

947
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
that you can farm

948
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
from the infernal hordes.

949
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So there's going to be

950
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
a lot to chase down in there.

951
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That's awesome.

952
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Thank you, Dan,

953
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,000
for like sharing,

954
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
going through all that stuff.

955
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I know with players

956
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
jumping in on PTR,

957
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
especially for

958
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and trying out

959
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
infernal hordes

960
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and everything,

961
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
what's kind of like

962
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
the top things

963
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that you really want them

964
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
to like kind of hone in on,

965
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
give feedback on,

966
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
check on for PTR?

967
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah, absolutely.

968
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We definitely need feedback

969
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
on the PTR.

970
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's super critical

971
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
to ensuring that,

972
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
you know,

973
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
the infernal hordes

974
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and all the rewards

975
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
feel great

976
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
for when the season launches.

977
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So here are some

978
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
of the topics

979
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,000
that, you know,

980
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
we could use some help on.

981
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
First off,

982
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,000
you know,

983
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
just how is

984
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
the infernal hordes gameplay?

985
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000
How do the boons

986
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and banes feel?

987
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You know,

988
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
which ones do you like

989
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
the most or the least?

990
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And these are types of things

991
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
that will help us

992
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
fine tune that experience.

993
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Similarly,

994
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
you know,

995
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
how is it acquiring compasses?

996
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Do you have too much?

997
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Too few?

998
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
How do you feel

999
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
about upgrading them?

1000
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You know,

1001
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
that could help us

1002
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
really dial in

1003
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,000
kind of the access

1004
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
to the infernal hordes.

1005
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
We're also interested

1006
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,000
in learning

1007
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
how you feel

1008
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
about the difficulty

1009
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and the gameplay length

1010
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
of the different tiers.

1011
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Like I said at the top,

1012
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
we've got eight different tiers

1013
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
of difficulty.

1014
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And so,

1015
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,000
you know,

1016
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
we have the ability

1017
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
to dial those in a little bit.

1018
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,000
We want to make sure

1019
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
that players can

1020
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
really replay this

1021
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
over and over again

1022
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,000
as they push

1023
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
into the end game.

1024
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Much like the pit.

1025
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And then finally,

1026
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,000
of course,

1027
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
how are the rewards?

1028
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You know,

1029
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
which do you like

1030
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the most or the least?

1031
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You know,

1032
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,000
we can certainly

1033
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
make tweaks

1034
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
on the rewards

1035
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
to make sure

1036
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
they're as enticing

1037
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,000
as possible.

1038
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Awesome.

1039
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah,

1040
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and I know

1041
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
with the infernal hordes,

1042
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
this is kind of a,

1043
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
this is another alternative

1044
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
because as you mentioned,

1045
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
you can jump into it

1046
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
starting with world tier three.

1047
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So,

1048
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,000
if you're actually

1049
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
leveling a new character,

1050
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
you can actually

1051
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
jump into infernal hordes

1052
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and you're able

1053
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,000
to earn,

1054
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,000
like,

1055
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
experience

1056
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
in here.

1057
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So,

1058
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you actually have

1059
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
the opportunity

1060
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,000
of,

1061
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,000
like,

1062
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
jumping into hell tides

1063
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,000
if you want to.

1064
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You can jump into

1065
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
infernal hordes.

1066
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
When you get to,

1067
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,000
you know,

1068
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
85 or something like that,

1069
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
you can jump into pits.

1070
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So,

1071
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
there's now,

1072
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,000
like,

1073
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,000
more,

1074
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
or nightmare dungeons,

1075
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
obviously,

1076
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,000
when you're updating,

1077
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
you're upgrading

1078
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
your glyphs and everything.

1079
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So,

1080
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,000
there's a lot of

1081
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
different variety now

1082
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
for being able to

1083
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
kind of level up

1084
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
a character,

1085
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
especially as you're

1086
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,000
going to that

1087
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
mid to late game

1088
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
phase of your

1089
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
character's journey,

1090
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
you could say.

1091
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah,

1092
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
something else to bring up

1093
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
for the rewards

1094
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
for the infernal horde

1095
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,000
as well that I want

1096
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
to clarify.

1097
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So,

1098
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Dan mentioned about,

1099
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
you know,

1100
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,000
there's going to be

1101
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
uniques that are there

1102
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
that you can target

1103
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,000
farm in the infernal hordes.

1104
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,000
There's actually going

1105
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
to be a group of uniques

1106
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and legendaries

1107
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that you're able to

1108
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
target farm in that

1109
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
piece of content

1110
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
in the infernal hordes.

1111
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So,

1112
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
you're also,

1113
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
kind of similar

1114
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
to how the normal game works,

1115
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
you know,

1116
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
how you can target farm

1117
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
a unique from a boss

1118
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,000
but you can find it

1119
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
anywhere else in the world.

1120
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It's the same way here

1121
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,000
where you can get

1122
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
these new uniques

1123
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and legendaries anywhere

1124
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
but you have a better chance,

1125
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,000
you know,

1126
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
if you're targeting them

1127
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
in the infernal hordes.

1128
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And this is the first time

1129
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
that we're doing this

1130
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
with a group of legendaries

1131
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,000
as well.

1132
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
We have legendary powers

1133
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
that are actually able

1134
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
to be target farmed

1135
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
in the infernal hordes

1136
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
which is actually

1137
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
something a little bit

1138
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,000
new to the game.

1139
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So,

1140
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I just wanted to clarify that

1141
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and in addition to that

1142
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
we're also adding

1143
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
new uniques

1144
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,000
and legendaries

1145
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
to the rest of the game

1146
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
as well

1147
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
in addition to this.

1148
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So,

1149
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
there's actually

1150
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
a very large group

1151
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,000
of uniques.

1152
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I think it's over 50

1153
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
or something.

1154
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah,

1155
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
there's over 50

1156
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
new uniques

1157
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and legendaries

1158
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
coming into season five.

1159
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
We have a lot coming.

1160
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's pretty extensive.

1161
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And a lot more

1162
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
to talk about there too.

1163
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah,

1164
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
this was just kind of

1165
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
a small preview

1166
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
of what people

1167
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
are looking at here

1168
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and they'll be able

1169
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
to jump in more

1170
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,000
and actually check it out

1171
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
on PTR

1172
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
because all of them

1173
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
will be present there.

1174
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I know Adam

1175
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
is actually going to talk

1176
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
through a few additional

1177
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
ones here later.

1178
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But,

1179
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,000
yeah,

1180
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Dan,

1181
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
this is awesome.

1182
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Can't wait for players

1183
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
to jump in.

1184
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I appreciate you

1185
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
informing

1186
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and providing

1187
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
all the new updates

1188
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and everything.

1189
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's exciting.

1190
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yep.

1191
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
From the sweltering heat

1192
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
of all,

1193
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm going to keep

1194
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,000
bringing it up.

1195
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
They canceled school

1196
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,000
up there.

1197
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's crazy.

1198
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm like,

1199
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
that's absolutely insane.

1200
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But,

1201
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
we will be seeing Dan

1202
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,000
again here later

1203
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
especially when we get

1204
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
into Q&A at the end.

1205
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But,

1206
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Dan,

1207
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,000
thank you again.

1208
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I think we're...

1209
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh,

1210
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,000
you're welcome.

1211
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah.

1212
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Awesome.

1213
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Appreciate it.

1214
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And then,

1215
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I think we're going

1216
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
to jump into

1217
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
a little bit

1218
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
of some balance

1219
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and class updates

1220
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
with Mr. Adam Jackson.

1221
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah,

1222
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
let's get to it.

1223
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We have a lot

1224
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,000
to talk about.

1225
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I think we have...

1226
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah,

1227
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
so the topics

1228
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm going to be

1229
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
covering today,

1230
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
we've got unique items.

1231
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We're going to be

1232
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
talking quite a bit

1233
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,000
about that.

1234
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We've got some updates

1235
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
to mythic uniques

1236
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
that are very exciting

1237
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and near and dear

1238
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,000
to my heart.

1239
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And then,

1240
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
we've got your

1241
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
standard class updates.

1242
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
A lot of stuff

1243
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
coming in Season 5.

1244
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
One thing to clarify here

1245
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,000
is that we are going

1246
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
to be releasing

1247
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
the patch notes soon,

1248
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,000
so I'm not going

1249
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
to be going over

1250
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,000
every single,

1251
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
you know,

1252
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,000
class update

1253
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
because there's

1254
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,000
a ton of them.

1255
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Kind of similar

1256
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
to Season 4.

1257
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm really only

1258
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,000
going to highlight

1259
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
just like one

1260
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
major thing

1261
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
for each class

1262
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
on the stream today,

1263
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,000
but you'll be able

1264
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
to see all the things

1265
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that we're doing

1266
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,000
in the patch notes.

1267
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,000
There's a lot.

1268
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So, first,

1269
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,000
uniques.

1270
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
We have some

1271
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
quality of life updates

1272
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,000
here,

1273
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
really targeting

1274
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
how you get uniques

1275
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that I'm pretty pumped

1276
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,000
about to announce

1277
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
here today.

1278
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So,

1279
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
you can now target

1280
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
farm uniques

1281
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
from three additional sources.

1282
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You can target them

1283
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
from oval vendors,

1284
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
helltide chests,

1285
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and whisper caches.

1286
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
These places

1287
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,000
where you've always

1288
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
been able to,

1289
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,000
you know,

1290
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
kind of target farm

1291
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
certain gear slots

1292
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and not been able

1293
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
to get uniques

1294
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,000
and you're wondering,

1295
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
well, why couldn't we do that?

1296
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That stinks.

1297
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Well, now you can

1298
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and it's awesome

1299
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and I love it.

1300
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So, here,

1301
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,000
just to give some

1302
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
more detail

1303
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
into how this works

1304
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
is basically

1305
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
when you open,

1306
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,000
like, I'm just going

1307
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
to use helltide chests

1308
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
as an example, right?

1309
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,000
If you want

1310
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
a specific unique weapon,

1311
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
let's say,

1312
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
you can just simply

1313
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
target the weapon

1314
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
helltide chests

1315
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and you'll be able

1316
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
to have a chance

1317
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
to get only unique weapons

1318
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
for your class

1319
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
from those chests.

1320
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So, when you're targeting

1321
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
a specific thing,

1322
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,000
you just go to,

1323
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,000
you know,

1324
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,000
the place that has

1325
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
that slot,

1326
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,000
whether it's the

1327
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
oval vendor,

1328
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
the helltide chest,

1329
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,000
or the whisper cache

1330
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and you'll have a chance

1331
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,000
to get uniques

1332
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that are targeted

1333
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
for that slot.

1334
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So, it kind of adds,

1335
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,000
you know,

1336
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
while you're doing

1337
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
your normal grind

1338
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,000
of, you know,

1339
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
doing the boss ladder,

1340
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
killing the boss,

1341
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
you can also be

1342
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
collecting ovals,

1343
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
doing the helltides,

1344
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,000
doing the whispers

1345
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and having a chance

1346
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
to target and get

1347
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
that unique as well

1348
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
from that content.

1349
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And, in addition to that,

1350
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
this is also true

1351
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
for mythic uniques.

1352
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So, I'll just give

1353
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
an example here

1354
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
of exactly how this works.

1355
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Let's say that you want

1356
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
to get, you know,

1357
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Harlequin crest,

1358
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,000
a Shaco,

1359
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
or Andariel's Visage.

1360
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You don't want

1361
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
to target those helms.

1362
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You could be targeting

1363
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
helms from helltide,

1364
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,000
targeting helms,

1365
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and, you know,

1366
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
when you turn in your ovals

1367
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
to the oval vendor,

1368
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and every time,

1369
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
if you get a mythic unique,

1370
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
you will get one of those two

1371
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
from that source.

1372
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Now, also to clarify,

1373
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
let's say that you are,

1374
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
like, targeting gloves

1375
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,000
for some reason.

1376
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You know,

1377
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
we don't have any mythic

1378
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,000
unique gloves yet.

1379
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Then, if you were to get

1380
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,000
a mythic unique,

1381
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
you still can.

1382
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It'll just give you

1383
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
a random one instead,

1384
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,000
since, you know,

1385
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
you can't target one

1386
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
in that slot.

1387
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So, pretty exciting way

1388
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
to target kind of

1389
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the things that you want

1390
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,000
while you're farming

1391
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
for the things that you want.

1392
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's going to be amazing.

1393
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, I'm really excited.

1394
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I know we've heard

1395
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
a lot of players going like,

1396
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,000
hey, you know,

1397
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
we do the endgame bosses

1398
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
a whole lot,

1399
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and we're trying to,

1400
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and you can actually find them

1401
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
just in the open world as well.

1402
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We've actually seen

1403
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
a lot of cases,

1404
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
especially with this past season,

1405
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
where players are jumping

1406
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,000
into helltide,

1407
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and they're actually

1408
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,000
finding them there,

1409
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
but now it's an additional,

1410
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
or additional options

1411
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,000
for players,

1412
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,000
which I think will be

1413
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
a lot better

1414
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
for just overall

1415
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
finding some of the gear

1416
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that everyone really wants.

1417
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,000
As someone who,

1418
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
for the last three seasons,

1419
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
my uniques have always

1420
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
come from the beast in ice,

1421
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I am very selfishly invested

1422
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
in getting this into the game.

1423
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yes, yes.

1424
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,000
So.

1425
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
All right, let's talk about

1426
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
other unique updates here.

1427
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We're going to be making

1428
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
a whole lot of updates

1429
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
to our unique items,

1430
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,000
so I'm going to be

1431
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
covering a lot today.

1432
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
We've heard your feedback,

1433
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and we're going to be

1434
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
doing some updates here.

1435
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
To clarify,

1436
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
before I go into

1437
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000
what the updates are,

1438
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
you are going to be

1439
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
seeing these updates

1440
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
to the way that we think about

1441
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and our philosophy

1442
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
around uniques

1443
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and how they work.

1444
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You're going to be seeing them

1445
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,000
in the PTR

1446
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
for the new uniques

1447
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
coming into season five.

1448
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Between the PTR

1449
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and the launch,

1450
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
you'll be seeing

1451
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
in the season five launch

1452
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
these updates

1453
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
to all the existing uniques

1454
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,000
in the game.

1455
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So when season five comes out,

1456
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
basically all the uniques

1457
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,000
will get these updates

1458
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
that I'm about to talk about,

1459
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
but in the PTR,

1460
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
you're only going to really see this

1461
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
in the new uniques

1462
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
coming into the game.

1463
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah, there.

1464
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So now we can go on

1465
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
to the next part.

1466
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
All right.

1467
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So the team's been talking a lot.

1468
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
As many of you probably know,

1469
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
in season four,

1470
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
we did Ironization 2.0,

1471
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
we didn't really update

1472
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,000
the uniques

1473
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
almost at all in the game.

1474
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We didn't do a big pass

1475
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
to cover how they exist

1476
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
in tempering

1477
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
or anything like that.

1478
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So the team's been talking

1479
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
a lot about

1480
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
what is the role

1481
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
of uniques in Diablo 4?

1482
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
How are they different

1483
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
from legendary items?

1484
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Because they're kind of similar

1485
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,000
in that they both give you

1486
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
a legendary power

1487
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
that's really strong.

1488
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But how are they different?

1489
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And what do we want them

1490
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
to be long-term?

1491
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And we've kind of landed

1492
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
on a few things here

1493
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that I'm going to talk about.

1494
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,000
The first one is that,

1495
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
you know,

1496
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,000
they're powerful

1497
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and exciting items

1498
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that kind of direct players

1499
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
to builds, right?

1500
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So imagine you're

1501
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
a Fireball Sorc.

1502
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You know,

1503
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
we've got two uniques for you.

1504
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
They really target you.

1505
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You're going to feel

1506
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,000
a lot better playing

1507
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
with Fireball

1508
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
when you take them.

1509
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You know,

1510
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
we want you to take

1511
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,000
these things

1512
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and kind of level up

1513
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000
your build.

1514
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,000
They're moments of like

1515
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
very large incremental power

1516
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,000
where you feel like

1517
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
you're, you know,

1518
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
filling in your fantasy

1519
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,000
as a class.

1520
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The next one is that

1521
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
they're kind of

1522
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
pick up and play, right?

1523
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They're easy to evaluate.

1524
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The moment that you

1525
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
pick up the unique,

1526
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,000
you know,

1527
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
you know whether

1528
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
it's a good one

1529
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,000
or a bad one.

1530
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We want this to be

1531
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000
a little bit different

1532
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
from Legendary Powers

1533
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
where, you know,

1534
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,000
you pick it up

1535
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
and you kind of

1536
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,000
go on a journey

1537
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
where, you know,

1538
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
you make it into something

1539
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
that's really good.

1540
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,000
A unique,

1541
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
you know when you pick it up

1542
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,000
whether or not

1543
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
it's one that you want to keep

1544
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
or one that you don't.

1545
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And then the last one,

1546
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,000
pretty obvious

1547
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
but was worth saying,

1548
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
you know,

1549
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,000
they're kind of more

1550
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
rare chase items

1551
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
that players don't see

1552
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,000
very often.

1553
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You know,

1554
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
when you're going

1555
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
they're going to be

1556
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
a good one.

1557
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You know,

1558
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
you want to upgrade

1559
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
your codex.

1560
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
They are the way

1561
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
that you can,

1562
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,000
you know,

1563
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
get greater affixes

1564
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and temper

1565
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and masterwork them.

1566
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So there's a reason

1567
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
why you want to churn

1568
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and look through

1569
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000
a lot of them.

1570
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Uniques,

1571
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
you do want to get

1572
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
a good one obviously

1573
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
but not nearly as often

1574
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
as like a Legendary Power.

1575
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We don't need that

1576
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
aspect of their design.

1577
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So they are more rare,

1578
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,000
they're harder to get

1579
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
but when you get it

1580
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
it's kind of like

1581
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,000
a more exciting moment

1582
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
like did I get

1583
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,000
the perfect one?

1584
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And then if not

1585
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
you go and try

1586
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and get the next one.

1587
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So let's talk a little

1588
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,000
about our goals

1589
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
for the update

1590
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
that we're going

1591
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,000
to be doing here.

1592
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
One of the things

1593
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
that we come to a lot

1594
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
that we talk about

1595
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,000
on the team

1596
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,000
is this idea

1597
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I like this quote

1598
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,000
of like players

1599
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
build their Legendaries

1600
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and players build

1601
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
around their Uniques,

1602
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
right?

1603
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Your Legendary Power

1604
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
is very,

1605
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
or your Legendary Items

1606
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
are very malleable.

1607
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You know,

1608
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
the moment you get it

1609
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
you don't know yet

1610
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,000
if it's going to be

1611
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
the best in slot item

1612
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
but it has a chance to be

1613
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
but they're also like

1614
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,000
able to fit

1615
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
in a lot of different ways.

1616
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You can manipulate

1617
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
their stats via,

1618
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,000
you know,

1619
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
enchanting,

1620
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
via tempering

1621
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and masterworking

1622
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and so there's a lot

1623
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
that you can do

1624
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
with the item

1625
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
once you've gotten it.

1626
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Whereas Uniques

1627
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
are a lot more static,

1628
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
right?

1629
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The stats on them

1630
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
can't change,

1631
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
you can't really

1632
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
manipulate them very much

1633
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and sometimes

1634
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,000
they have maybe

1635
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
qualities to them

1636
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,000
or stats that are

1637
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
a little bit inconvenient

1638
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
and you've got to figure out

1639
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
like how do I overcome

1640
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
this little detriment

1641
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
or make my build

1642
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
into where it's a plus

1643
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
instead of a detriment,

1644
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,000
right?

1645
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Like it's a fixed thing

1646
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
that you have to build around

1647
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,000
which is very different

1648
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
than a Legendary.

1649
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Also ideally

1650
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,000
we want players

1651
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
to run two to four Uniques

1652
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
in their build.

1653
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You know,

1654
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
one of the difficult parts

1655
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
of this

1656
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and I think we're going

1657
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
to be continuing

1658
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,000
to work on

1659
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
with the balance

1660
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and design of Uniques

1661
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,000
is that,

1662
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,000
you know,

1663
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
we want you to run some

1664
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
but we don't want you

1665
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
to run all of them

1666
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
in your build,

1667
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,000
right?

1668
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's very easy

1669
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,000
to go one way

1670
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,000
or the other.

1671
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I can very easily

1672
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
make you run no Uniques

1673
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and I can very easily

1674
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,000
make you run like

1675
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
every slot is a Unique

1676
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,000
by making them

1677
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
really, really crazy,

1678
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,000
right?

1679
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
We want these to fit

1680
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
in such a way

1681
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that you're running

1682
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
some of them,

1683
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,000
the ones that are

1684
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
applicable to your build

1685
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
or maybe some spicy ones

1686
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
here or there

1687
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,000
that you try and,

1688
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,000
you know,

1689
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
like making a special way

1690
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
to work with you

1691
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
but not all of them.

1692
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I would say right now

1693
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,000
like on live

1694
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
in season four

1695
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
players are running

1696
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
more like zero to two

1697
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,000
in their build

1698
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
so it's not as much

1699
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
as we want

1700
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,000
which means that

1701
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
we want to update them

1702
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,000
to make them

1703
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
a little bit more attractive.

1704
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And another one

1705
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,000
is we kind of want

1706
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
to move away

1707
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
from these generic

1708
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
fits all build

1709
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
styles of Uniques,

1710
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,000
right?

1711
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
One thing that I know

1712
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,000
a lot of players

1713
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
have talked about

1714
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,000
in the past

1715
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
that we've had

1716
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
is that some of our Uniques

1717
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
are just so generically good

1718
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
and this is particularly

1719
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
scary for us

1720
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,000
when it's like

1721
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
what we call

1722
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
generic Unique

1723
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,000
which is one

1724
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
where every class

1725
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,000
can use it

1726
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and so like

1727
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
if every class

1728
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,000
can use it

1729
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
and every build

1730
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,000
can use it

1731
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and it's better

1732
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
than like the build

1733
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
specific or class

1734
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
specific stuff

1735
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
then it just becomes

1736
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000
best in slot

1737
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000
for everybody

1738
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and we've taken away

1739
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,000
your agency

1740
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and your choice

1741
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,000
because you're just

1742
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
going to target

1743
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,000
this item

1744
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and ignore everything else,

1745
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
right?

1746
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
The only items

1747
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,000
in the game

1748
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that we really want

1749
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
to fit that role

1750
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
are like Mythic Uniques

1751
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
where they're

1752
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
across all classes

1753
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
and they're so good

1754
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
but they're also

1755
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
extremely rare

1756
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
so you're very excited

1757
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
to see them

1758
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
whenever you see one

1759
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
but all the other

1760
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,000
regular Uniques

1761
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
we don't want to

1762
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
fit that design space

1763
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
so we're going to be

1764
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
trying to move away

1765
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
from these ones

1766
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and readjust them

1767
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and redesign them

1768
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000
a little bit

1769
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
where they fit

1770
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
into all kinds of builds

1771
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and kind of target

1772
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
something that they're

1773
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,000
really good at

1774
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
or that's a little bit

1775
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
more unique about them

1776
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and make them

1777
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
really good at that

1778
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and less generically

1779
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,000
good at everything.

1780
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's funny because

1781
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
everyone's in the chat

1782
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
going like

1783
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
oh rip Shaco

1784
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
rip Shaco

1785
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,000
but we just

1786
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
literally

1787
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
we just said

1788
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Mythics is not

1789
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
they're a different beast

1790
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,000
here

1791
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm talking about

1792
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
all your regular ones

1793
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, Shaco's still

1794
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
going to be just as good

1795
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,000
if not better

1796
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
honestly

1797
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Alright, so

1798
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
enough preamble

1799
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
what are we actually doing?

1800
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So we're going to be doing

1801
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
two big updates

1802
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
to Uniques

1803
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The first one is

1804
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
we're going to be

1805
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
increasing the upper power

1806
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
of the Unique effects

1807
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and the role range

1808
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
we're going to be doing

1809
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
an increase in the range

1810
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
from an average of

1811
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,000
10 to 20 roles

1812
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
which I'll explain in a second

1813
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and then we're also

1814
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,000
going to be increasing

1815
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
the upper power

1816
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
of like how much

1817
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
you can get from the roles

1818
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
this is really just

1819
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
buffing pretty much

1820
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
most Uniques across the board

1821
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
to compete with the new world

1822
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,000
of Legendary Powers

1823
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
that we live in

1824
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,000
since you know

1825
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
they got extra power

1826
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000
juice to them

1827
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
now Uniques are catching up

1828
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So as an example here

1829
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I gave you know

1830
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
if an older Unique

1831
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,000
like one on live

1832
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
gave you around 40 to 80%

1833
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
multiplicative damage

1834
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
that's going to go up

1835
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
to like 40, 100

1836
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
maybe 120

1837
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
maybe even higher

1838
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
really the mandate is

1839
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
as high as we can get away with

1840
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
without breaking things

1841
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and then we're also

1842
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,000
going to be increasing

1843
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
the role range

1844
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
so this is like

1845
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
the number of possible roles

1846
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,000
it can do

1847
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
from an average of 10 to 20

1848
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
so it'll be a little bit harder

1849
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
to get basically

1850
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
what we're targeting here

1851
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
is the discrepancy

1852
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,000
inside of a Unique

1853
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
is a little bit wider

1854
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
where the difference

1855
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
of like a low role

1856
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and a high role

1857
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
is a little bit bigger

1858
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
but the high roles

1859
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
are way better

1860
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
than they were before

1861
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
so they're more exciting

1862
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
when you get them

1863
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
really good

1864
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
but it's a little bit

1865
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
harder to get there

1866
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
and the next one

1867
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
is going to be updating

1868
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
the affixes

1869
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
the actual stats

1870
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,000
on the Uniques

1871
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
we're doing a pass

1872
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
on all of them

1873
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and this is kind of

1874
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000
what we're doing

1875
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
the first thing is

1876
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,000
we're changing their stats

1877
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
to fit with the season 4 updates

1878
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,000
right

1879
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
we're doing the things

1880
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
like we did before

1881
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
of simplifying stats

1882
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,000
you know

1883
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
getting rid of

1884
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
super conditional things

1885
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,000
making them

1886
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
just more generically

1887
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
understood and good

1888
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
we're also going to be

1889
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
adding tempering stats

1890
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
we're open to really adding

1891
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
whatever we want

1892
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
that makes the Unique

1893
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,000
fit the fantasy

1894
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
so as an example here

1895
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
you know

1896
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
a lot of two-hand weapon Uniques

1897
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
have a problem

1898
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,000
where they're all

1899
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
basically competing

1900
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
against bonus projectiles

1901
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,000
as an affix

1902
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
because you can just

1903
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
temper that onto your weapons

1904
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,000
right

1905
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
so when it comes

1906
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
to those kind of situations

1907
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
we'll just slap the bonus projectiles

1908
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,000
on that Unique

1909
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
and now you know

1910
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
it's no longer competing

1911
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
in that way

1912
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
or we have to kind of

1913
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
dance around it

1914
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,000
we can just put it

1915
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
we're also open to the idea

1916
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,000
by the way

1917
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
of breaking slot restrictions

1918
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
kind of like we did

1919
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
in season 2

1920
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
so you can have bonus projectiles

1921
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,000
or other things

1922
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
on other slots

1923
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
you know

1924
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,000
like Uniques are

1925
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
where we get to play

1926
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
a little bit

1927
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
and just really make

1928
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
something thematic

1929
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and cool

1930
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and build defining

1931
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and so they have

1932
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,000
less restrictions

1933
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
than everything else

1934
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
and the other one

1935
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,000
is we're updating

1936
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
the stat power levels

1937
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
and the effects

1938
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
so the idea here

1939
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,000
that we're thinking

1940
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and this is particularly

1941
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
nuancy when it comes

1942
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000
to generic Uniques

1943
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
but stats that kind of

1944
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
fit the theme

1945
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
or the fantasy

1946
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,000
of the Unique

1947
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
are going to be

1948
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
like way stronger

1949
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
than your normal stats

1950
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,000
right

1951
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
so as an example

1952
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
if you have a Unique

1953
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,000
that's targeting

1954
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
fire damage

1955
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
maybe it's like a meteor

1956
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
or a firewall

1957
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and the sorcerer

1958
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
whatever it may be

1959
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,000
you know

1960
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
that plus fire damage

1961
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
can be juiced up

1962
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
to be really really high

1963
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
but stats that are

1964
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
more like generically good

1965
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
like you know

1966
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I don't know

1967
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
attack speed

1968
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
max life

1969
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,000
resist all

1970
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
those ones

1971
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
aren't going to be juiced

1972
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
unless it fits

1973
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
the theme of the Unique

1974
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,000
really well

1975
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
right

1976
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
so we have an example

1977
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,000
here of one

1978
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
that has been a problem

1979
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
for us in the past

1980
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I kind of want to go

1981
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,000
through how we would

1982
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
think about it

1983
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm not going to say

1984
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,000
exactly what we're

1985
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
going to do here

1986
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
to T'Balt's Will

1987
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
but kind of give you

1988
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
our thought process

1989
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
right

1990
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
so T'Balt's Will

1991
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
as many of you know

1992
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
in previous seasons

1993
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
was kind of a problem

1994
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
where it just became

1995
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
best in slot

1996
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
for almost every build

1997
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
you know

1998
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
the famous line we say

1999
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
is damage on pants

2000
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
which was impossible

2001
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
to get almost anywhere

2002
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,000
else in the game

2003
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and it turned out

2004
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
damage on pants

2005
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
was really really good

2006
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,000
right

2007
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
it also gave you

2008
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
damage reduction

2009
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
one of the best stats

2010
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000
in the game

2011
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and then it also gave you

2012
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,000
a bunch of

2013
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
it also sold resource

2014
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
in many ways

2015
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
for you as well

2016
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,000
right

2017
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,000
it gave you a bunch

2018
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
of resource

2019
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,000
whenever you became

2020
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
unstoppable

2021
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
which wasn't too hard

2022
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,000
to do

2023
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
so it was doing

2024
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
a lot of things

2025
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,000
at once

2026
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,000
it gave you

2027
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
a very unique effect

2028
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
with putting damage

2029
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,000
on a slot

2030
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
that you don't get it

2031
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
it also gave you

2032
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
resource

2033
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
which is something

2034
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
that every class

2035
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
wants very heavily

2036
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and Adam

2037
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
it gave you

2038
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
three extra potions

2039
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and three extra potions

2040
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,000
yes

2041
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
now that one

2042
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
that's alright

2043
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
but yeah

2044
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
so you know

2045
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,000
the way that we would

2046
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
tackle this one

2047
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
to give you an idea

2048
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,000
is like

2049
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
you know

2050
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
we either would

2051
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
kind of pick

2052
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,000
do we want to focus

2053
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
this on the damage

2054
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,000
aspect

2055
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
that it's damage

2056
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
on a non-damage slot

2057
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
or maybe we focus

2058
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,000
on the resource

2059
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
aspect

2060
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and like

2061
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
double down

2062
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,000
on that

2063
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and make that

2064
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,000
really powerful

2065
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and really cool

2066
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
or we do like

2067
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,000
a little bit of both

2068
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
but if we do both

2069
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
then it's not going

2070
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
to give you the defenses

2071
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
that another

2072
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
pants slot would give

2073
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,000
right

2074
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
basically in our mind

2075
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
we'd be like

2076
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,000
we want to give

2077
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
the minimum amount

2078
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
of defense

2079
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,000
where it's not just

2080
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
like a trash item

2081
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
because it has nothing

2082
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
but then after that

2083
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
not so much

2084
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and you're going to

2085
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
have to solve

2086
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,000
your defenses

2087
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
in other slots

2088
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,000
or somewhere else

2089
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
to justify getting

2090
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
the damage

2091
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
on this slot

2092
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,000
is how we would

2093
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
think about it

2094
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,000
right

2095
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and so we're having

2096
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
a lot of conversations

2097
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,000
now

2098
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I don't think

2099
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,000
we're going to nail

2100
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
every single item

2101
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
perfectly in this

2102
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,000
first pass

2103
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
so we're really

2104
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
looking for feedback

2105
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
when you jump

2106
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
into season 5

2107
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,000
and beyond

2108
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
and we'll be

2109
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
adjusting them

2110
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,000
but I want to

2111
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
give you an idea

2112
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,000
of what we're doing

2113
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and kind of

2114
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
what we're thinking

2115
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and targeting

2116
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
with this

2117
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
so I think

2118
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,000
we can move on

2119
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
so Mythic Uniques

2120
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
are getting a facelift

2121
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,000
here

2122
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
so lots of updates

2123
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,000
here

2124
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Mythic Uniques

2125
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
are now going

2126
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
to be truly Mythic

2127
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,000
they're getting

2128
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
a new color beam

2129
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,000
when they drop

2130
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
on the ground

2131
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
they're coming out

2132
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
with an awesome

2133
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,000
new sound

2134
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,000
that you're going

2135
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
to hear in a little bit

2136
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
we've got new

2137
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,000
item UI

2138
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
that you can see

2139
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,000
so they have

2140
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
a different color

2141
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
they really are

2142
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
going to look

2143
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and feel like

2144
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
the special items

2145
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,000
that they are

2146
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
and we have a video

2147
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
here to show you

2148
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,000
the sound

2149
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and what it looks

2150
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,000
like on the ground

2151
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
so you can see here

2152
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,000
this beam looks

2153
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
very different

2154
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
than anything else

2155
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
isn't that sound

2156
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
that echoey sound

2157
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I love it

2158
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,000
sounds like

2159
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I don't know

2160
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
it sounds like

2161
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
you're murdering

2162
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,000
a bunch of

2163
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
church organs

2164
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
or something like that

2165
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
it's just like crazy

2166
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
but yeah

2167
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,000
so you know

2168
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
when this thing drops

2169
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,000
you're definitely

2170
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
going to know

2171
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
when you got one

2172
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,000
no more

2173
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
like sifting through

2174
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,000
your uniques

2175
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
to see if it's

2176
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
actually one of the mythics

2177
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
you'll know right away

2178
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
so we're really excited

2179
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
about this

2180
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,000
super happy

2181
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
it was able to get in

2182
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
alright

2183
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
and last but not least

2184
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,000
let's talk about

2185
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
class updates

2186
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'm going to cover

2187
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,000
some generic things

2188
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
across all classes

2189
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and then go through

2190
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
a little bit of each one

2191
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
again this is not

2192
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,000
going to be nearly

2193
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
close to everything

2194
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
that we're doing

2195
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
just a little taste

2196
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,000
to teaser

2197
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
for what you can

2198
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
expect to see

2199
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
let's start with

2200
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
things across all classes

2201
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
one systemic update

2202
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
we're doing to the game

2203
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
is invulnerability skills

2204
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
are now going to

2205
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
start their cooldown

2206
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
when the invulnerability

2207
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
ends instead of

2208
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
when the skill begins

2209
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
this is really to

2210
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,000
prevent things like

2211
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
infinite invulnerability

2212
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and really to open up

2213
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
design space for us

2214
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
on the team

2215
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
because now we can

2216
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,000
be more comfortable

2217
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
adding things like

2218
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
invulnerable duration

2219
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,000
to skills

2220
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
or cooldown reduction

2221
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
more liberally

2222
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and things like that

2223
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,000
where we don't have

2224
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
to worry about this

2225
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
this is very similar

2226
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
to what our previous

2227
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,000
games have done

2228
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and some other games

2229
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
do and we think

2230
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
it'll be a good fit here

2231
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
the idea isn't really

2232
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
to like make it

2233
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that you can't be

2234
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
invulnerable very often

2235
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
it's just to prevent

2236
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
like a hundred percent

2237
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
uptime where you

2238
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
actually break down

2239
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
the combat of the game

2240
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,000
and you're not

2241
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
interacting with

2242
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,000
enemies anymore

2243
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the next one is

2244
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
we reviewed monster CC

2245
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
and we generally

2246
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
reduce the CC duration

2247
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,000
and frequency

2248
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
across the board

2249
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
so you know

2250
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
if you were frustrated

2251
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,000
by getting frozen

2252
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
for a million years

2253
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and then dying

2254
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
that'll happen

2255
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
much less often

2256
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
and also to help

2257
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
with this

2258
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
potions can be used

2259
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
while CC'd

2260
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
even while you're stunned

2261
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
so you know

2262
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,000
while you're frozen

2263
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
standing there

2264
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and everybody's around

2265
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000
you trying to kill you

2266
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
you can at least

2267
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
spam potion a little bit

2268
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
and maybe survive

2269
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,000
sometimes

2270
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
next one

2271
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
we've got some

2272
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,000
bug fixes

2273
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
see there's some

2274
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
of the notable ones

2275
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
we do have more

2276
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,000
coming in

2277
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
but these are the ones

2278
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I wanted to call out

2279
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Rogue Victimized

2280
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
is no longer

2281
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,000
going to be double

2282
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
dipping on its damage

2283
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
which was resulting

2284
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
in a lot more

2285
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,000
multiplicative

2286
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
or a lot more damage

2287
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
really than it was

2288
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,000
supposed to have

2289
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
damage over time effects

2290
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
were getting double

2291
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,000
the amount of

2292
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
percent damage

2293
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
that they were supposed to

2294
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and Skeleton Reapers

2295
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
were getting both

2296
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Book of the Dead bonuses

2297
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
when the second option

2298
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
was selected

2299
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and again this is

2300
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,000
you know just a little

2301
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
bit of a preview

2302
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
but we have other

2303
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
bug fixes coming

2304
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,000
but these are some

2305
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
of the bigger ones

2306
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
we want to call out

2307
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
all right now

2308
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
let's get to the classes

2309
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
so Barbarian

2310
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,000
they have a new

2311
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
unique coming in

2312
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
this is the Unbroken Chain

2313
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
this is for you

2314
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
support Barbarians

2315
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,000
or really just more

2316
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
defensively oriented ones

2317
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
basically what this is

2318
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
going to do is create

2319
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,000
a connection between

2320
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Steel Grasp and Iron Maelstrom

2321
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
where you'll be able to

2322
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
cast Iron Maelstrom

2323
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,000
a lot more often

2324
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
is you use Steel Grasp

2325
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and also enemies

2326
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,000
damaged by Iron Maelstrom

2327
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
are going to be doing

2328
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
less damage

2329
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
for a little while

2330
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
so the idea here

2331
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,000
is you know

2332
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
you could debuff enemies

2333
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
debuff those bosses

2334
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and make them do less

2335
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
damage to you

2336
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
so you can survive better

2337
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and next the Rogue

2338
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Flurry is going to be

2339
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,000
getting a lot of big

2340
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
updates

2341
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
we updated the enhancement

2342
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
and both of their

2343
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,000
upgrades

2344
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
so you'll be able to

2345
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
see kind of a theme

2346
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,000
here going on

2347
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
before you know

2348
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
you would damage

2349
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,000
a crowd control

2350
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
or vulnerable enemy

2351
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
for the enhancement

2352
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
then you would heal

2353
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
now when Flurry

2354
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
hits an enemy

2355
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
you can just

2356
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
make them vulnerable

2357
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,000
so actually Flurry

2358
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
becomes a vulnerable

2359
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
generator here

2360
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
which is pretty exciting

2361
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
and it'll also deal

2362
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,000
more damage

2363
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
as you hit vulnerable

2364
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
enemies

2365
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
stacks up really high

2366
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
so the idea here is

2367
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,000
with Flurry builds

2368
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
you want to make

2369
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
everything vulnerable

2370
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and then just keep

2371
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
whacking them with Flurry

2372
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and gain a bunch of damage

2373
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
and now Improved Flurry

2374
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
is changing

2375
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
before it was about

2376
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
vulnerable spreading

2377
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
but now Baseline

2378
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
you can just generate

2379
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,000
vulnerable

2380
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
so we don't need

2381
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,000
that anymore

2382
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
so now Improved Flurry

2383
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
is going to actually

2384
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,000
give you a dash

2385
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
so now similar to

2386
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
things like

2387
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
the Shred on the Druid

2388
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
you can kind of

2389
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
dash to your target

2390
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and also every time

2391
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,000
you cast Flurry

2392
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
now it's going to

2393
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,000
heal you

2394
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
so it's going to be

2395
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
a lot more mobile

2396
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
a lot more awesome

2397
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
very cool

2398
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
and then last but not least

2399
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
to compete with a dash

2400
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
what could we do

2401
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
with Advanced Flurry

2402
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
well we can just add

2403
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
a stupid amount of damage

2404
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and resource cost reduction

2405
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
so before you know

2406
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,000
you had to evade

2407
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
through an enemy

2408
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and then do damage

2409
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
with one cast

2410
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
and stun enemies

2411
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
now as you spam Flurry

2412
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
it'll basically get

2413
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
a big damage bonus

2414
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
and its energy cost

2415
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
will go down

2416
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,000
which will let you

2417
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
be able to spam it

2418
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
even more often

2419
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
so the idea here

2420
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,000
is you just want to be

2421
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
using it over and over

2422
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and over again

2423
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
and it'll get stronger

2424
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,000
and stronger

2425
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
and ramp up

2426
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
pretty heavily as you go

2427
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I'm excited for Flurry Rogues

2428
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
very excited

2429
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
they're going to be

2430
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,000
like little hummingbirds

2431
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
around bouncing around

2432
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and it's going to be great

2433
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
ironically I'm playing

2434
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Flurry this season

2435
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
so I'm always off by one

2436
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I always play the thing

2437
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and then like

2438
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
oh we're going to

2439
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
massively make it better

2440
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,000
next time

2441
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
but it's fine

2442
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
everything's fine

2443
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
next Druid

2444
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Shepard's Aspect

2445
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,000
we've gotten feedback

2446
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
from players for a while

2447
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,000
now about how

2448
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Shepard's Aspect

2449
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,000
kind of dominates

2450
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
the meta for Druids

2451
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
because you're basically

2452
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,000
both

2453
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
it's both not great

2454
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,000
from a design

2455
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
and a balanced perspective

2456
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
on the design side

2457
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
we're telling you

2458
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
to put companions

2459
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,000
on your bar

2460
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
and then they're

2461
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
actually just buffing you

2462
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
so we make this

2463
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
companion build fantasy

2464
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,000
but it's actually

2465
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
just making the player

2466
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,000
better

2467
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and then on the power side

2468
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
you're basically

2469
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
just slotting

2470
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
three skills

2471
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,000
on your bar

2472
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
with your companions

2473
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
and then not really

2474
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
caring about buffing

2475
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,000
them or using them

2476
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
because they're just

2477
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,000
kind of there

2478
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
as proxies

2479
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,000
to make you better

2480
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
so we've changed it

2481
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
now where

2482
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
basically it's going

2483
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
to be about the

2484
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000
companions

2485
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
so your companion

2486
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
skills are just

2487
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
going to deal damage

2488
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,000
for every companion

2489
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
that you have

2490
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
so the bigger your zoo

2491
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
the better your zoo

2492
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
is going to perform

2493
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and to compensate

2494
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
players we're doing

2495
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
some pretty massive

2496
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
buffs to Druid

2497
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
skills baseline

2498
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,000
to compensate

2499
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
so your skills

2500
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
are just going to be

2501
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
getting that damage

2502
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,000
baseline

2503
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and in many cases

2504
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,000
a little bit more

2505
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
so you can check that

2506
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
out when you see

2507
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the PTR patch notes

2508
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
after this

2509
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
but we basically

2510
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
just buffed everything

2511
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,000
across the board

2512
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and made it so that

2513
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Shepherds isn't

2514
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
required anymore

2515
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
next for the Sorceress

2516
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
this is Axial Conduit

2517
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I'm really excited

2518
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
about this unique

2519
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
this is your Chain

2520
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Lightning unique

2521
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
so Chain Lightning builds

2522
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
you finally have a unique

2523
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
that really talks to you

2524
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
and you can see here

2525
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
kind of our stats

2526
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
and that new philosophy

2527
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I told you about

2528
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
you have chance

2529
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
to double cast Chain Lightning

2530
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
on pants

2531
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
instead of just a weapon

2532
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
so that's pretty cool

2533
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
so basically

2534
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
the way that this works

2535
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
we're going to have a video

2536
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,000
but I'm going to explain

2537
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
to you how this works

2538
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
because it actually changes

2539
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
your skill pretty significantly

2540
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
so now when you cast

2541
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Chain Lightning

2542
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
the way it's going to work

2543
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
is it's going to cast

2544
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and bounce on enemies

2545
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,000
just like before

2546
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
but then it's going to

2547
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
come back to you

2548
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
and orbit you a little bit

2549
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
and then it's going to

2550
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
go out and hit another enemy

2551
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and then come back to you

2552
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and orbit

2553
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and then come out

2554
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and then go out

2555
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and do another enemy

2556
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and come back

2557
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and it's going to do that

2558
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
back and forth a few times

2559
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
and every time it comes back to you

2560
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
is going to drain

2561
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
some of your mana

2562
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and after it drains

2563
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
so much mana

2564
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
after coming back 10 times

2565
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
the bolt is actually

2566
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
going to explode

2567
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
for a ridiculous amount

2568
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
of lightning damage

2569
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,000
on enemies

2570
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
so there's a mini game here

2571
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,000
where basically

2572
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
oh and by the way

2573
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,000
you can cast

2574
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
multiple Chain Lightning

2575
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
when this is out

2576
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
you're basically going to be

2577
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
like running a gambit here

2578
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
and the mini game

2579
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
is you want to stack

2580
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
as much resource regeneration

2581
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
as you can

2582
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
so that your lightning bolts

2583
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,000
can survive

2584
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
being drained over and over

2585
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
and bouncing everywhere

2586
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
so they can last

2587
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
to their explosion

2588
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
and do a ton of damage

2589
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,000
to enemies

2590
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
one thing I want to call out

2591
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,000
here also

2592
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
is that because it drains mana

2593
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
resource cost reduction

2594
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
won't work on that drain

2595
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
you're actually going to want

2596
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to focus on gaining resource

2597
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
which is a little bit different

2598
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
and kind of makes this build

2599
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
a little special

2600
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I think and unique

2601
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
compared to other resource

2602
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
builds based around resource

2603
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
so let's see it in action here

2604
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
so you'll see what one cast

2605
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,000
looks like

2606
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and then I think we'll see

2607
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,000
what it looks like

2608
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
when you spam it

2609
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
so you can see here

2610
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,000
it circles you

2611
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
goes and hits enemies

2612
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
circles you

2613
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,000
goes and hits enemies

2614
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
and then it does a big explosion

2615
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,000
at the end

2616
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
that we've tuned the damage

2617
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
to be pretty high

2618
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
see there

2619
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
so then it explodes

2620
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
so oh wait

2621
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
oh do we have one

2622
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
where it casts a bunch of times

2623
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
maybe we don't

2624
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
oh there we go

2625
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
there we go

2626
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
so see here

2627
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
you can see that

2628
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,000
as you go

2629
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
it will keep going

2630
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
going going

2631
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,000
and then explode

2632
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
a bunch of times

2633
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
another thing I want to point out

2634
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
is if you're hugging enemies

2635
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
in melee range

2636
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
as it's circling you

2637
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
it will also hit enemies

2638
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
so you now have a way

2639
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
to really maximize your damage

2640
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
by hugging bosses and such

2641
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
the damage goes way up

2642
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
so next

2643
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
last but not least

2644
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
the necromancer

2645
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
so we got some feedback

2646
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
we've had this for a while

2647
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and felt this on the team

2648
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,000
where you know

2649
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
the golem we really love

2650
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
you know we love our golem

2651
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
our golem boys

2652
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
and you know

2653
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
but sometimes it can be frustrating

2654
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
where you tell the golem

2655
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,000
to go somewhere

2656
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
and then it kind of takes a while

2657
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
to lug his butt over there

2658
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and do his slam

2659
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
or his shout or whatever

2660
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
and you know

2661
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
things can get in the way

2662
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
and so we've kind of

2663
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
upgraded him a little bit

2664
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I'll let the video speak

2665
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
for himself here

2666
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
but so now you can see

2667
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
your golem will Hulk smash

2668
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
and just jump on enemies

2669
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
and slam them down

2670
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
so this will work

2671
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
with all of your golem types

2672
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,000
by the way

2673
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
not just the iron golem

2674
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
but now your golem

2675
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
is going to leap to the area

2676
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
that you tell him to go

2677
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
and then cast his ability

2678
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
so we're really excited

2679
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,000
about this

2680
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
shout out to Charles Dunn

2681
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
who got this change in

2682
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and our animators

2683
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
who helped us out

2684
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
but we're really pumped for it

2685
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
it looks amazing

2686
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
yeah

2687
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
so those were the

2688
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
the class imbalance changes

2689
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
and I know

2690
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
we jumped a slide there

2691
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
how dare you production

2692
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,000
no

2693
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
but we are

2694
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
as they wave to me

2695
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
like I'm sorry

2696
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
we do want to go into

2697
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
some quality of life updates

2698
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
we do have a significant

2699
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
amount of quality of life

2700
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
updates that we do

2701
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
want to go through

2702
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
that will be available

2703
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
in season 5

2704
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
and you guys will actually

2705
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
be able to check this out

2706
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
in the PTR

2707
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
so now we can go

2708
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
to the next slide

2709
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
where we do want to talk

2710
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
about some Helltide

2711
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and Whisper updates

2712
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,000
specifically

2713
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
so I know

2714
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
this has been kind of

2715
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
at least it's been

2716
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
a pain point for me

2717
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and I've heard

2718
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
it's been a pain point

2719
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
for others

2720
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
is that as you guys

2721
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
are going through Helltide

2722
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
there are Whisper objectives

2723
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:02,000
within there

2724
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
to help you with your

2725
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
progression on your

2726
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Whisper bar

2727
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
but the issue

2728
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
with the ones

2729
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
in Helltide

2730
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
is that it can sometimes

2731
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
take quite a while

2732
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,000
to do

2733
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
and you know

2734
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
sometimes players

2735
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
would have to leave

2736
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,000
the Helltide

2737
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
to go to another area

2738
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
to complete some

2739
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,000
of these Whisper objectives

2740
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
so we are optimizing

2741
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
this to ensure

2742
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
that they don't take

2743
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
nearly as much time

2744
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
the ideal goal

2745
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
is to get a bunch

2746
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,000
of value

2747
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
within those 15 minutes

2748
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
and to potentially

2749
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:29,000
end up getting

2750
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
a full entire Whisper

2751
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
10 point bar

2752
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
within 15 minutes

2753
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
in one Helltide

2754
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,000
so you can do

2755
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
a full Whisper

2756
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
every Helltide

2757
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,000
so that would be

2758
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
it would be a huge help

2759
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
because I know

2760
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
at least for me

2761
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I've always had to

2762
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
like kind of

2763
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,000
leave a Helltide

2764
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
and I kind of

2765
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
try to knock

2766
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
some of that out

2767
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
especially help

2768
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,000
for players

2769
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
that are looking

2770
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
for additional gold

2771
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,000
because Whisper caches

2772
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
have always been

2773
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
great sources of gold

2774
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and now

2775
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
as Adam mentioned

2776
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
you can also use

2777
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Whisper caches

2778
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
to target farm

2779
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
so it's keeping

2780
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
things more optimized

2781
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
for players

2782
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,000
which we know

2783
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
will be way

2784
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
better there

2785
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
the next thing

2786
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
we do want to talk

2787
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
about is also

2788
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Baneful Hearts

2789
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I know

2790
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
this may not sound

2791
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
like a huge

2792
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
quality of life thing

2793
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,000
or a buff

2794
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
of any sort

2795
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
but we have noticed

2796
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
that players

2797
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
have had a lot

2798
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
of Baneful Hearts

2799
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
within their inventory

2800
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
we do want to make

2801
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
these a little bit

2802
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
more valuable

2803
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
so they won't drop

2804
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
as frequently

2805
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
we know that players

2806
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,000
will still have

2807
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
a significant amount

2808
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
but maybe not

2809
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
hundreds and hundreds

2810
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
like some people

2811
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
have within their

2812
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,000
inventory

2813
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
but players

2814
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,000
should not have

2815
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
any type of issues

2816
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
regarding having

2817
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
a ton of these

2818
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Baneful Hearts

2819
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
but we are tweaking

2820
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
the drop rate

2821
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,000
because they were

2822
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
dropping a little

2823
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
too much there

2824
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
tempering

2825
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
the very

2826
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,000
very

2827
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I guess like

2828
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
brought up topic

2829
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
well

2830
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and like

2831
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
yeah

2832
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,000
people like

2833
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
talking about

2834
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,000
tempering

2835
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
it's pretty popular

2836
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
yeah

2837
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,000
so I want to take a minute

2838
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
to talk about tempering

2839
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
and kind of how the

2840
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
design team sees it

2841
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
and kind of what we're

2842
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
happy with

2843
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,000
what we think could be

2844
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
better

2845
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
and some adjustments

2846
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
we'll be making

2847
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,000
in season 5

2848
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
so first high level

2849
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
kind of how we see

2850
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
tempering

2851
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
we really think

2852
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
that it's important

2853
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,000
that items have

2854
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
an end point

2855
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
where players know

2856
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
kind of that the item

2857
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,000
is done

2858
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
and that they're not

2859
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
hoarding lots of them

2860
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
forever on the chance

2861
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
that they can all be good

2862
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,000
right

2863
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
one of the big

2864
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
key goals

2865
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
of season 4

2866
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
was that we didn't

2867
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
want you saving

2868
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
a million items

2869
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
in your stash space

2870
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and while we know

2871
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
that you know

2872
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,000
bricking an item

2873
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
never feels great

2874
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
we do need

2875
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
that to be something

2876
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
that's possible

2877
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
to do in the game

2878
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,000
so that you know

2879
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
when the journey is done

2880
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and you're not just

2881
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
holding on to an item

2882
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,000
forever

2883
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
so that part we actually

2884
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
think is working

2885
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,000
very well

2886
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
where you know

2887
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,000
an item is done

2888
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
and you try and go

2889
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
get another one

2890
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
and so you're always

2891
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
interested in items

2892
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and trying to you know

2893
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
have that game loop

2894
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
go in the game

2895
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
indefinitely

2896
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
or until you feel

2897
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
like your character

2898
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
is maxed on its power

2899
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
but we do agree

2900
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,000
with players

2901
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
that you know

2902
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
the RNG right now

2903
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
is like completely

2904
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,000
out of their hands

2905
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
which doesn't really

2906
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
feel great

2907
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,000
you know you get

2908
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
so many tries

2909
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
basically to roll

2910
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and then that's kind of it

2911
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and you're done

2912
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
and it doesn't feel great

2913
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
so we're looking at ways

2914
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,000
in the future

2915
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
for players

2916
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
to have more control

2917
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
over that RNG

2918
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,000
so that you know

2919
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
you have more ways

2920
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
to maybe manipulate

2921
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,000
the tempering

2922
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
or get the odds

2923
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
in your favor

2924
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and do other things

2925
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
like that

2926
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
one update

2927
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
that's going to be

2928
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
coming in season 5

2929
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
it won't be in the PTR

2930
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
but as we're targeting

2931
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,000
for launch

2932
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
is that

2933
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
you know we've got

2934
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,000
a lot of feedback

2935
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
that it feels so bad

2936
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,000
when you know

2937
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
you get that like

2938
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
triple greater affix

2939
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and it has the same

2940
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
number of rolls

2941
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
and then you brick it

2942
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and then you have to try

2943
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and go get another one

2944
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
so in season 5

2945
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
to help with this

2946
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
you know as your item

2947
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
gets better basically

2948
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,000
that you find

2949
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
you're going to have

2950
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
more chances to temper it

2951
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
so a much better chance

2952
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
to get the one

2953
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,000
that you want

2954
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
basically what will work

2955
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,000
is you're going to

2956
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
basically get one extra

2957
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
roll per greater affix

2958
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
that you have

2959
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,000
so you know you have

2960
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
one greater affix

2961
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,000
one roll

2962
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
three three rolls

2963
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and again just to clarify

2964
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
this is not in the PTR

2965
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
but it will be in for the

2966
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
launch of season 5

2967
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
in itself

2968
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
and again just to reiterate

2969
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
we are still looking at

2970
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
ways to help out

2971
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
that experience

2972
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,000
within tempering

2973
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
as we've noted

2974
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
we agree with players

2975
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
that it doesn't always

2976
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
feel great

2977
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
and so you guys

2978
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
should expect to hear

2979
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
more updates to tempering

2980
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
after we get through

2981
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
season 5 for sure

2982
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
yeah

2983
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
alright

2984
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
next up

2985
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
weapons

2986
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
yeah

2987
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,000
so I'll talk about

2988
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
this one a little bit

2989
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
we took a look at

2990
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
this chart

2991
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
yeah this chart

2992
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
we took a look at

2993
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
inherent affixes

2994
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
on weapons

2995
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and we found that

2996
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,000
you know a lot of

2997
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
inherent affixes

2998
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
like damage to distant

2999
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
or some other ones

3000
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
were a little too

3001
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,000
conditional

3002
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
and didn't get the

3003
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,000
update you know

3004
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
in season 4

3005
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,000
that we wanted

3006
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
so we went back

3007
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and made them

3008
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
a little bit more

3009
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
generically useful

3010
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and better across

3011
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,000
more builds

3012
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
so we have a little

3013
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
chart here

3014
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,000
but you can see

3015
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
kind of

3016
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
this is going to be

3017
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,000
the new

3018
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
inherent affixes

3019
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,000
on all the different

3020
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
weapon types

3021
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
so we've made

3022
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,000
quite a few

3023
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
adjustments here

3024
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
you know as an

3025
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
example

3026
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,000
you know vulnerable

3027
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
damage is on

3028
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
bows

3029
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
and dot damage

3030
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,000
is on axes

3031
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
which I believe

3032
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
vulnerable on bows

3033
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
is new

3034
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,000
but yeah

3035
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
so we made

3036
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
quite a few updates

3037
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,000
we basically just

3038
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
looked at the

3039
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
matrices of everything

3040
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and kind of

3041
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
adjusted it to see

3042
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
what makes sense

3043
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
so basically

3044
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
you're just going to

3045
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000
have you know

3046
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
things that actually

3047
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
impact your builds

3048
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
much more often

3049
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,000
on the weapons

3050
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
that you want

3051
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and as another

3052
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
result of this update

3053
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
we are also looking

3054
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,000
at what weapons

3055
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
classes can use

3056
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and we updated

3057
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
them a little bit

3058
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
to try and you know

3059
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
let more classes

3060
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,000
use more weapons

3061
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
we want players

3062
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
to be able to

3063
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
create interesting

3064
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,000
builds

3065
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
play the way

3066
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,000
that we want

3067
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and so we want

3068
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,000
to open up

3069
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
these things

3070
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
as much as we can

3071
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,000
in our designs

3072
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
so now druids

3073
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
are going to be able

3074
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,000
to use two hand

3075
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
pull arms

3076
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
one hand swords

3077
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and daggers

3078
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
sorceresses

3079
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,000
are going to be able

3080
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
to use one hand

3081
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
swords and maces

3082
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
and necromancers

3083
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
are going to be able

3084
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,000
to use

3085
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I think it's

3086
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
maces and axes

3087
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,000
actually

3088
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
despite this

3089
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
necromancer

3090
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,000
picture right here

3091
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
that is not

3092
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,000
using

3093
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
well it's using

3094
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
a two handed

3095
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,000
sword but you can

3096
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
already use a

3097
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
two handed sword

3098
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,000
but not using

3099
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
a

3100
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
yeah and the

3101
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
necromancer here

3102
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I know it's

3103
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,000
supposed to say

3104
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
all maces

3105
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
and axes

3106
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
as opposed to

3107
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
all swords

3108
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,000
so

3109
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
but yeah

3110
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,000
basically

3111
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
we're going

3112
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,000
to be

3113
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
opening up

3114
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,000
these classes

3115
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,000
to use

3116
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
more weapon

3117
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,000
types

3118
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and then

3119
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
also some

3120
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,000
of the uniques

3121
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,000
are going

3122
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
to be updated

3123
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,000
for the classes

3124
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
as well

3125
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,000
so the

3126
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
butcher's cleaver

3127
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,000
can now be

3128
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
used for

3129
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,000
necros

3130
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and sorcerers

3131
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
can use

3132
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,000
doom brainer

3133
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and azure

3134
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,000
wrath

3135
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
now

3136
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000
yeah

3137
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000
sorcerers

3138
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
can use

3139
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
azure wrath

3140
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,000
kind of like

3141
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
d2

3142
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,000
yep

3143
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
fits their

3144
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,000
theme very

3145
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,000
well too

3146
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
so

3147
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I think

3148
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
that'll be

3149
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,000
pretty cool

3150
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
some additional

3151
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,000
quality of life

3152
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
updates

3153
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
now we're going

3154
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,000
to talk about

3155
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
some endgame

3156
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,000
bosses

3157
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
as I have

3158
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,000
experienced

3159
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
as Adam

3160
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
has experienced

3161
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,000
earlier

3162
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,000
as he mentioned

3163
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
in the stream

3164
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
we are making

3165
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,000
changes to the

3166
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
beast in ice

3167
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
you guys will

3168
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
no longer

3169
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
have to make

3170
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,000
a sigil

3171
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
to summon

3172
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
the beast in ice

3173
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
which is a

3174
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
huge quality of

3175
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
life update

3176
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
the beast will

3177
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
now live

3178
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,000
in a standard

3179
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
dungeon

3180
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
the crawl

3181
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
to get to

3182
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
the beast in ice

3183
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,000
is much

3184
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
much shorter

3185
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,000
now

3186
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
it's going to be

3187
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,000
more similar

3188
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
to what we've

3189
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
seen with

3190
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
some of the

3191
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
other endgame

3192
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,000
bosses

3193
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
and then at the

3194
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
same time

3195
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
eternal players

3196
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,000
that have

3197
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
maybe

3198
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
already built

3199
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,000
out some of

3200
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
these sigils

3201
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
we made sure

3202
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000
to keep you

3203
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000
in mind

3204
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
so you can

3205
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
still use

3206
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,000
those sigils

3207
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,000
to fight

3208
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
the boss

3209
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,000
you won't

3210
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
need summoning

3211
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,000
materials

3212
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,000
you can just

3213
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
use the

3214
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,000
sigil right

3215
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,000
there

3216
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
in the

3217
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
boss room

3218
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,000
in itself

3219
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and this

3220
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,000
no longer

3221
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
requires sigil

3222
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
dust to

3223
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,000
actually summon

3224
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
the beast in

3225
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,000
ice

3226
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
so some

3227
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,000
big changes

3228
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
to the beast

3229
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,000
in ice

3230
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
to help

3231
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
out that

3232
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
whole entire

3233
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,000
feel

3234
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
especially

3235
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,000
when you're

3236
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
really target

3237
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
farming the

3238
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,000
beast in

3239
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
ice

3240
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,000
sometimes

3241
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
it was

3242
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,000
kind of

3243
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
brutal

3244
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
to have to

3245
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,000
go through

3246
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,000
the whole

3247
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
entire dungeon

3248
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,000
each and

3249
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
every time

3250
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
so many times

3251
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
next we have

3252
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Varshan

3253
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
the body parts

3254
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
are pretty much

3255
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,000
being reduced

3256
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
to one

3257
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I know it was

3258
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
eating up a lot

3259
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,000
of inventory

3260
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
space

3261
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
it was kind of

3262
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,000
hard to manage

3263
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
at times

3264
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and everything

3265
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
so we're

3266
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
optimizing this

3267
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,000
making this

3268
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
better

3269
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
so now you'll

3270
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,000
just need one

3271
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
body part

3272
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
to essentially

3273
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
summon Varshan

3274
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
going forward

3275
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
starting with

3276
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
season five

3277
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
and one

3278
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,000
big thing

3279
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
that we're

3280
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,000
going to

3281
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,000
call out

3282
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:50,000
here

3283
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
before

3284
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and this

3285
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,000
is kind

3286
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
of like

3287
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,000
the cherry

3288
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
on top

3289
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
we should

3290
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
let's actually

3291
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,000
just play the

3292
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
clip and see

3293
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,000
if people

3294
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
actually notice

3295
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,000
it

3296
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
and if not

3297
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,000
then we'll

3298
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,000
call it out

3299
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
could be

3300
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,000
different

3301
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
this time

3302
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
poor Durial

3303
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,000
yeah

3304
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
mythic unique

3305
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,000
maybe

3306
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
no that's

3307
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
not it

3308
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,000
oh

3309
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
good gear

3310
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,000
though

3311
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
but something

3312
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
that is

3313
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
interesting here

3314
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
is the

3315
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,000
cauldron

3316
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
has reappeared

3317
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
you can just

3318
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,000
resummon

3319
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
him again

3320
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,000
there's the

3321
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
altar right there

3322
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000
you can now

3323
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
resummon

3324
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
all the

3325
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,000
end game

3326
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
bosses

3327
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
without needing

3328
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,000
to run

3329
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,000
out of the

3330
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
dungeon

3331
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
reset

3332
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
the dungeon

3333
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
so this will

3334
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
help a whole

3335
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,000
lot

3336
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
we'll make

3337
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,000
things

3338
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
way better

3339
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,000
in terms of

3340
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
like optimizing

3341
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
when you're

3342
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
for time

3343
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and everything

3344
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
especially when

3345
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
you're a party

3346
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,000
and you're like

3347
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
everyone leave

3348
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,000
the dungeon

3349
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,000
so I can

3350
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
reset

3351
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,000
and stuff

3352
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
like that

3353
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,000
now you'll

3354
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
be able to

3355
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,000
do that

3356
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
immediately

3357
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
for all

3358
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
the end game

3359
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,000
bosses

3360
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
which is a

3361
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
huge huge

3362
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,000
feature I know

3363
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
that players

3364
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,000
have been

3365
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
asking for

3366
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
so that

3367
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
will be also

3368
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,000
incorporated

3369
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
into season

3370
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,000
five

3371
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
so lots

3372
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,000
and lots

3373
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,000
of changes

3374
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
for season

3375
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
five

3376
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
one other

3377
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,000
thing

3378
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I did want

3379
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
to call out

3380
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
regarding tempering

3381
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,000
because

3382
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
just to clarify

3383
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,000
because we've

3384
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
got some people

3385
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
going like

3386
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I don't

3387
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,000
understand

3388
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
the greater

3389
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
affix stuff

3390
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
in terms of

3391
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,000
additional roles

3392
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
if you have

3393
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,000
a one star

3394
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
greater affix

3395
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
you'll get

3396
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,000
one additional

3397
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,000
role

3398
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
if you have

3399
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,000
a three star

3400
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
or four star

3401
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,000
or something

3402
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,000
you would get

3403
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
three or four

3404
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
depending

3405
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
the amount

3406
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
of stars

3407
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,000
that you

3408
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,000
actually

3409
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
specifically

3410
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,000
have

3411
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
on your

3412
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
item

3413
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
yeah

3414
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,000
it goes up

3415
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
to three

3416
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,000
three

3417
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
sorry

3418
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,000
four

3419
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
unique

3420
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
yeah

3421
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,000
yeah

3422
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
yeah

3423
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,000
if

3424
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
thinking

3425
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
razor plate

3426
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,000
or something

3427
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
like that

3428
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,000
but

3429
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
the other

3430
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
thing

3431
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,000
that I did

3432
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,000
want to

3433
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
call out

3434
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
is that

3435
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
this is

3436
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
actually

3437
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,000
going to

3438
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,000
be

3439
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
retroactive

3440
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
so

3441
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,000
for

3442
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
players

3443
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
that

3444
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
still

3445
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
have

3446
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,000
maybe

3447
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
an item

3448
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,000
that

3449
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
they may

3450
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,000
have

3451
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
potentially

3452
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
bricked

3453
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
and it's

3454
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
sitting

3455
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
in their

3456
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
stash

3457
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
you know

3458
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
just for

3459
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,000
like

3460
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
memento

3461
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,000
purposes

3462
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
or anything

3463
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,000
like that

3464
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
yeah

3465
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,000
when your

3466
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
character

3467
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,000
does move

3468
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
to eternal

3469
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
if it

3470
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,000
was a

3471
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,000
greater

3472
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
affix

3473
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,000
like a

3474
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,000
three star

3475
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
greater

3476
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,000
affix

3477
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,000
or something

3478
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
like that

3479
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
you will

3480
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,000
end up

3481
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
getting those

3482
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,000
afterwards

3483
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
so

3484
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
that will

3485
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,000
appear

3486
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
after these

3487
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
changes

3488
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,000
actually are

3489
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
implemented

3490
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,000
with the

3491
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
start of

3492
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,000
season 5

3493
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,000
it'll just

3494
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
be on your

3495
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,000
internal

3496
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,000
character

3497
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
obviously

3498
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,000
because your

3499
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,000
seasonal

3500
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
character

3501
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,000
will move

3502
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
to eternal

3503
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
as I fix

3504
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
my earpiece

3505
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,000
that's like

3506
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
falling out

3507
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
but

3508
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
one other

3509
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
thing I did

3510
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,000
want to

3511
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,000
call out

3512
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
as well

3513
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
for season 5

3514
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
we have some

3515
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
really big

3516
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,000
accessibility

3517
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
options that

3518
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
are being

3519
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
added to

3520
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,000
the actual

3521
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
game

3522
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
and we

3523
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,000
really

3524
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
need some

3525
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
testing on

3526
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,000
this in

3527
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
the season 5

3528
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,000
PTR

3529
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,000
this is

3530
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
actually called

3531
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,000
out in

3532
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
our blog

3533
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,000
we would

3534
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
really love

3535
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,000
if players

3536
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
can actually

3537
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
check them

3538
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,000
out

3539
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,000
test them

3540
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
out

3541
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,000
provide

3542
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,000
feedback

3543
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I will

3544
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
note

3545
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000
we aren't

3546
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
planning

3547
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,000
despite it

3548
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
being in

3549
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
the season 5

3550
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,000
PTR

3551
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
we aren't

3552
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,000
planning on

3553
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
these features

3554
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
actually launching

3555
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
with season 5

3556
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,000
we really want

3557
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
to take the

3558
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,000
feedback

3559
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
make them

3560
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
you know

3561
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,000
better

3562
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
for when

3563
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
they are

3564
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,000
ready

3565
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,000
and right

3566
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
now I think

3567
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
that the plan

3568
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,000
would be that

3569
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
they would be

3570
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,000
ready for

3571
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
season 6

3572
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
but it's

3573
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
important for

3574
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,000
us to be

3575
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
able to get

3576
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,000
that feedback

3577
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
so we really

3578
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
need people

3579
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,000
to actually

3580
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
test out

3581
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
these specific

3582
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
features

3583
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
we have like

3584
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:55,000
an auto pin

3585
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:55,000
feature

3586
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
we have a

3587
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,000
compass feature

3588
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
and then we

3589
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
have like

3590
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,000
an audio

3591
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
navigation

3592
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
assistance feature

3593
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,000
that is coming

3594
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
within some of

3595
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,000
these accessibility

3596
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
features for

3597
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,000
season 5

3598
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
so really

3599
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
important for

3600
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,000
people to

3601
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
kind of like

3602
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:07,000
jump in

3603
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
check it out

3604
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
give us

3605
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,000
feedback

3606
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and then you'll

3607
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,000
see those

3608
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
in season 6

3609
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
after the PTR

3610
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,000
is kind of over

3611
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
but that is

3612
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,000
kind of like

3613
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
a huge wrap

3614
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
up of all

3615
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,000
the stuff

3616
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
that is coming

3617
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
for the

3618
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,000
season 5

3619
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
PTR

3620
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,000
and even

3621
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
a little bit

3622
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:23,000
more of

3623
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
even some

3624
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
of the stuff

3625
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:25,000
for season 5

3626
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
itself

3627
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
we do want

3628
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
to take some

3629
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,000
questions

3630
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,000
and we still

3631
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
have Dan

3632
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,000
on the line

3633
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
from the

3634
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
burning hells

3635
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,000
of Albany

3636
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
to answer

3637
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,000
any questions

3638
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
that we may

3639
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,000
have

3640
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,000
but I know

3641
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
we have a

3642
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:37,000
question

3643
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
specifically

3644
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,000
T-Dub

3645
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,000
so if you

3646
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
have questions

3647
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
please ask

3648
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,000
them in

3649
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Twitch chat

3650
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
which is where

3651
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
we have live

3652
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,000
chat going on

3653
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
right now

3654
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and we will

3655
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
try to get

3656
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,000
through as many

3657
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
as possible

3658
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,000
cool

3659
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
but first

3660
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,000
question I

3661
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
believe we

3662
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
have is

3663
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
because I

3664
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,000
teed up this

3665
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
question

3666
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
are there any

3667
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
new class buffs

3668
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,000
coming to season

3669
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
5

3670
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
specifically

3671
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
if Adam

3672
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,000
can answer

3673
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
druid and

3674
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,000
sorceress

3675
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
because I know

3676
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
we hear you

3677
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,000
everyone

3678
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
about druid

3679
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,000
and sorceress

3680
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I know we

3681
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,000
talked a little

3682
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
bit about it

3683
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,000
here but if you

3684
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
can like

3685
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
expand on it

3686
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,000
yeah

3687
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,000
yeah

3688
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
yes

3689
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
there are new

3690
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
class buffs coming

3691
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,000
to season 5

3692
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
covered a little

3693
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,000
bit

3694
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I think one

3695
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,000
thing they call

3696
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
out that people

3697
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,000
talk a lot about

3698
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
right now is

3699
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
how barbarians

3700
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,000
in particular are

3701
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
pretty strong

3702
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and then the

3703
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
classes that can't

3704
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,000
get as far as

3705
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
they can in the

3706
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
pit feels kind

3707
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,000
of bad

3708
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
there's a lot to

3709
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
chew on there

3710
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
but I think the

3711
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
short answer is

3712
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
yes we hear you

3713
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,000
and we're going to

3714
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,000
be looking to

3715
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
beef these things

3716
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
up

3717
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
we do have some

3718
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,000
specific ways that

3719
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
we want to be

3720
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
targeting these

3721
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,000
things and there's

3722
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
a lot of history

3723
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
to it

3724
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
barbarians in

3725
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
particular are

3726
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
tougher to balance

3727
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I think I've

3728
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
talked about this

3729
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
on stream a little

3730
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
bit before of

3731
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
because of their

3732
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
arsenal system

3733
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,000
they have more

3734
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,000
items

3735
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
anytime that we

3736
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,000
mess with

3737
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
and we've

3738
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,000
messed with

3739
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
the underlying

3740
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
systems of the

3741
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,000
game very heavily

3742
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
in the last year

3743
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
season 2

3744
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
we updated all

3745
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
the combat math

3746
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:55,000
which of course

3747
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
impacts items

3748
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
which impacts

3749
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,000
character power

3750
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
we've updated

3751
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
in season 4

3752
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
all of itemization

3753
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
which obviously

3754
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
directly impacts

3755
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,000
the arsenal system

3756
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
very heavily

3757
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
so when we do

3758
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
these large

3759
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,000
shakeups

3760
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
it's a lot more

3761
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,000
difficult in a

3762
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
short amount of

3763
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,000
time to get

3764
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
everything exactly

3765
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,000
perfect of how

3766
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
the combinatorics

3767
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
of those effects

3768
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,000
are going to

3769
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
impact classes

3770
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,000
right

3771
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
so that's one

3772
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
end of it

3773
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
another end is

3774
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
what we're trying

3775
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,000
to do

3776
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
and we started

3777
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
with this in

3778
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
season 4

3779
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
we're looking at

3780
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
the other class

3781
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,000
mechanics

3782
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
and we want to

3783
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,000
beef them up

3784
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
and give them

3785
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,000
the treatment

3786
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
that we gave

3787
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
with the

3788
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,000
necromancer

3789
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,000
and the book

3790
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
of the dead

3791
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
in season 4

3792
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
we actually wanted

3793
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
to try this

3794
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,000
as an experiment

3795
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
like hey

3796
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
the book of the

3797
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,000
dead

3798
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,000
the minions

3799
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
the sacrifice

3800
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,000
bonuses

3801
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
they're what

3802
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:41,000
really make

3803
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
necromancer feel

3804
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
really cool

3805
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,000
and special

3806
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
and unique

3807
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
so we're going

3808
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
to try and

3809
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
catch that up

3810
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,000
so to speak

3811
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
to the arsenal

3812
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,000
system on the

3813
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
barbarian

3814
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
and not only

3815
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,000
just increase

3816
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
the numbers

3817
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,000
because just

3818
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
increasing the

3819
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,000
numbers is

3820
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
kind of easy

3821
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,000
we even did

3822
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,000
that in the

3823
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
mid-season patch

3824
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,000
if you look

3825
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
at the druid

3826
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:55,000
boons

3827
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
we increased

3828
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
them by 50%

3829
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,000
doubled them

3830
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
in many cases

3831
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
but we think

3832
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
to really help

3833
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,000
solve that

3834
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
on the fantasy

3835
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
and even just

3836
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
design perspective

3837
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
we want to

3838
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
overhaul and

3839
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,000
really look at

3840
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
these mechanics

3841
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
and make them

3842
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,000
way better

3843
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
and more

3844
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,000
thematic

3845
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
to classes

3846
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
so we don't

3847
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,000
have anything

3848
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
to announce

3849
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,000
today for

3850
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
season 5

3851
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
but that's

3852
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,000
something more

3853
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
long term

3854
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,000
that we're doing

3855
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
to help that

3856
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
problem in the

3857
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,000
future

3858
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
in the short

3859
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
term we are

3860
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
looking at

3861
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
fixing the

3862
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,000
issues with

3863
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
these various

3864
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,000
classes

3865
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
buffing them

3866
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,000
up in different

3867
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
ways

3868
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,000
making different

3869
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
builds and

3870
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,000
other things

3871
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
viable and

3872
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,000
trying to

3873
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,000
keep that

3874
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,000
parity

3875
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
we're also

3876
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
looking at

3877
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
bringing down

3878
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
the outliers

3879
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,000
of power

3880
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,000
with the

3881
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
barbarian

3882
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,000
in different

3883
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
ways

3884
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
to make

3885
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,000
sure that they

3886
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,000
have more

3887
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
parity with

3888
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:33,000
other classes

3889
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
as well

3890
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
but that's

3891
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,000
kind of our

3892
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
short and

3893
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
long term vision

3894
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,000
of where we

3895
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
want this to

3896
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,000
be

3897
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,000
awesome

3898
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I know

3899
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
we have a

3900
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,000

specifically

3902
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000

3903
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
something I've

3904
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,000
seen a few

3905
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
times regarding

3906
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
season 5

3907

gameplay

3914
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,000

3915
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000

3916
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,000

eternal

3920
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
and seasonal

3921
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000

an ongoing

3925
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
thing going

3926
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
forward

3927
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
what can

3928
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,000
players expect

3929
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Dan

3930
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
sure

3931
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,000
yeah

3932
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,000
so

3933
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
with season

3934
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
five

3935
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
we wanted

3936
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
to build

3937
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,000
out

3938
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
the end

3939
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
game

3940
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,000
and because

3941
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
we're building

3942
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,000
out the

3943
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,000
end game

3944
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
we wanted

3945
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,000

3946
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000

01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
any of the

3948
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,000
end game

3949
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
things we're

3950
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000

and eternal

3954
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
and so

3955
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
in this

3956
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000

01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
rewards you get

3966
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,000

all that's

3968
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,000
eternal

3969
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000

3970
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
players are

3971
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,000

from it

3979
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
and as

3980
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Dan mentioned

3981
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
it's a

3982
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
new end game

3983
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
feature so

3984
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,000
it's like

3985
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
something that

3986
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,000
will be

3987
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
continuous

3988
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000

01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
even season

3990
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000

expect to

3996
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,000
jump in

3997
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Infernal

3998
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Hordes

3999
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
going forward

4000
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,000
which is

4001
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
pretty cool

4002
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
and yeah

4003
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,000
the feedback

4004
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,000
is going

4005
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
to be

4006
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,000
incredibly

4007
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
important

4008
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,000
during this

4009
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
PTR

4010
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:56,000
as Dan

4011
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
mentioned

4012
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,000

specific

4015
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
items that

4016
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
we're really

4017
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,000
hoping to

4018
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,000
get

4019
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
feedback on

4020
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
regarding

4021
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
how the

4022
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
boons feel

4023
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,000
how the

4024
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
rewards feel

4025
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
how the

4026
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
combat feels

4027
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and the

4028
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,000
waves and

4029
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,000
stuff like

4030
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
that will

4031
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
be really

4032
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,000
important for

4033
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,000
us during

4034
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
this specific

4035
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,000
moment

4036
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
what is the

4037
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
this is another

4038
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:16,000
season five

4039
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
question

4040
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
hopefully you

4041
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:18,000
might be able

4042
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:18,000
to answer

4043
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
this Dan

4044
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
this is from

4045
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Lucky Luciano

4046
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
shout out

4047
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Diablo

4048
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,000
partner

4049
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
what is the

4050
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,000
equivalent pit

4051
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
level of the

4052
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
eighth difficulty

4053
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,000
of like the

4054
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Infernal

4055
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Hordes

4056
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
pit level

4057
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I guess

4058
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,000
or nightmare

4059
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
dungeon

4060
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
or monster

4061
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,000
level

4062
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
yeah you're

4063
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,000
making me do

4064
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
math here

4065
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
yeah we just

4066
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,000
adjusted pit

4067
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
levels

4068
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,000
yeah so

4069
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
tier tier

4070
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
eight tier

4071
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
eight of the

4072
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Infernal

4073
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Hordes is

4074
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
going to be

4075
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
equivalent to

4076
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
about monster

4077
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
level I think

4078
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
it's 180 to

4079
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
200 so it

4080
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
goes up pretty

4081
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
high that's

4082
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,000
pretty late

4083
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
okay nice

4084
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
nice so a

4085
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
difficult challenge

4086
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
for sure which

4087
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,000
is good to

4088
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
hear we

4089
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,000
have a

4090
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
question from

4091
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Zapadas

4092
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
you all need

4093
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
easier names I

4094
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
swear do you

4095
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
foresee changes in

4096
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
grouping in the

4097
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
pit to allow

4098
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
group play to be

4099
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
more efficient

4100
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
there will be

4101
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
changes it won't

4102
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,000
be something

4103
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
present in PTR

4104
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
we'll talk more

4105
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
about it at the

4106
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
season five launch

4107
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
but the team is

4108
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
very aware of it

4109
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
because we've heard

4110
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
about like hey

4111
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
it's kind of not

4112
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
great to feel like

4113
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I'm getting only

4114
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
50% of you know

4115
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
the rewards

4116
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,000
associated when I'm

4117
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
in a group within

4118
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
a pit if I'm not

4119
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,000
the party leader

4120
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
specifically so it's

4121
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
something that the

4122
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
team is taking in

4123
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and we will have

4124
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
an update for

4125
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
players before season

4126
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
five and it will be

4127
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
live whatever change

4128
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
we have live in

4129
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
season five so a

4130
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
question from let's

4131
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
see I don't know

4132
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
well this one's easy

4133
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
okay robot Jomo

4134
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
what's the team's

4135
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
philosophy on rate

4136
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
of power gain it

4137
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
seems that tempering

4138
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
especially players

4139
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
gain too much power

4140
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
too quickly really

4141
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
removing the tension

4142
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
from leveling up

4143
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
experience any chance

4144
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
to add more friction

4145
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
to tempering materials

4146
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
costs etc yeah we

4147
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
have seen a little

4148
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,000
bit of this and heard

4149
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
this feedback ourselves

4150
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
it's kind of going in

4151
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
two different ways

4152
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
here so the leveling

4153
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
experience then how

4154
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
tempering messes with

4155
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
it right the leveling

4156
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
experience as people

4157
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
probably have seen

4158
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
has been sped up

4159
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
quite a bit right we

4160
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
do want people to be

4161
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
able to kind of level

4162
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
quickly and get to the

4163
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
fun of the game as

4164
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
quickly as possible so

4165
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
we do want them you

4166
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
know we don't want

4167
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
there to be a ton of

4168
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
friction like you know

4169
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,000
when we first launched

4170
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
the game we had the

4171
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
idea that like getting

4172
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
to level 100 alone was

4173
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
a big accomplishment

4174
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
right and we've learned

4175
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
that you know players

4176
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
really want to like

4177
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,000
fulfill their power

4178
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
fantasies get to the

4179
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
part where they're

4180
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:47,000
actually like

4181
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
incrementally increasing

4182
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
their character's power

4183
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:49,000
and finding things to

4184
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
use that power against and

4185
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
so they they enjoy that

4186
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
end game a lot and we

4187
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
want to get them there in

4188
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
a reasonable amount of

4189
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
time so that's the part

4190
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
that is like you know

4191
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
hey you know it's fine

4192
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
level quicker it's good

4193
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,000
right but then the other

4194
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
part is like tempering and

4195
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
kind of the tuning of the

4196
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
affixes we have heard the

4197
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
feedback and and kind of

4198
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,000
agree with it that you

4199
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
know the early tempering

4200
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
recipes are really really

4201
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
strong right that was by

4202
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
design when we launched

4203
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
season four one of the

4204
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
big kind of mandates to

4205
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
the team that we felt was

4206
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
important was we wanted you

4207
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
know before season four we

4208
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
constantly got the feedback

4209
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
and and knew it was true

4210
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
that you know your item

4211
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
stats weren't interesting

4212
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
enough and didn't matter

4213
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
enough and weren't very

4214
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
impactful and just didn't

4215
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
feel good right and so we

4216
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
we very much like juice

4217
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
them up to be very strong

4218
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
and in this new tempering

4219
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
system that manipulates

4220
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
them we made it very strong

4221
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
so that out the gate our

4222
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
goal was that when you

4223
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
temper an item you can

4224
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
really feel the damage it

4225
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
wasn't like this

4226
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
incremental my damage

4227
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
goes up in like 10

4228
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
different places here and

4229
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
there and now I'm strong

4230
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
it was like no this one

4231
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
thing happened and you

4232
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
felt it and it was good

4233
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and so we're gonna you

4234
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
know try and walk that

4235
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
line we're gonna probably

4236
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,000
go a little more in

4237
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
between here where you

4238
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
know we do agree that the

4239
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
tempering is warping the

4240
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
early game experience too

4241
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
much to the point that

4242
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
it's like you pick up an

4243
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
item and you don't care

4244
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
about the stats because

4245
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
you just temper something

4246
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:04,000
on and it's like way

4247
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
better right so we don't

4248
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
want that but we do still

4249
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
want them to feel and be

4250
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
really impactful so we

4251
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
have heard the feedback I

4252
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
don't remember don't

4253
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
think we have huge

4254
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,000
adjustments in season

4255
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
five right away but we

4256
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
are going to be looking

4257
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
at that leveling process

4258
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
and and streaming and

4259
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
lining that quite a bit

4260
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
we're having time

4261
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
actually and talks about

4262
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,000
that right now with

4263
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
various members of the

4264
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
team so it will be

4265
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
looked at not tons will

4266
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
change in season five

4267
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
though awesome a question

4268
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
from razzle dazzle

4269
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
dazzle dare is

4270
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
razzle dazzle dare is

4271
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
it's a long name to log in

4272
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
on did you say we can

4273
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
temper uniques are you

4274
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
open to letting us

4275
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
imprint affixes I had this

4276
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
thought and we can imprint

4277
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
a unique but only once

4278
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
yeah going back that was

4279
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
kind of what I talked

4280
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,000
about with the unique

4281
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
section we right now

4282
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
know I'm not going to

4283
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
say never in the future

4284
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
it's definitely the

4285
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
obvious thing that we

4286
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
could do like you know

4287
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,000
just add temporary uniques

4288
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
of course but we we want

4289
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,000
them to have an identity

4290
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
that is very different

4291
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
from legendaries one of

4292
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
the concerns with that is

4293
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
that the more that you

4294
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
give uniques manipulation

4295
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
the more that they just

4296
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
turn into legendaries with

4297
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,000
a different item color when

4298
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
they drop on the ground

4299
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
right like they're

4300
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
actually not different in

4301
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
how they work if we were

4302
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
able to manipulate stats

4303
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
add stats all those

4304
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
things so we do want them

4305
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
to have a different

4306
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
identity in the game so

4307
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
we're not doing it now

4308
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,000
but you know in the

4309
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
future we've talked about

4310
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
it we're open to the

4311
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
idea but we do want to

4312
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
try this first of like

4313
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
double down you know

4314
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
what makes a unique unique

4315
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
and that you build around

4316
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
it except there's a

4317
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
little bit of friction

4318
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
rather than just turning

4319
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,000
it into the item that you

4320
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
want every time yep a

4321
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
question from Baric is

4322
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
hey Adam or Adams I have

4323
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
a question for the Q&A

4324
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
how is the dev team

4325
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
feeling about the

4326
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
reception of season 4

4327
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
is that making them

4328
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
rethink any plans for

4329
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
future seasons I mean I

4330
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
think one thing that we

4331
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
can most definitely call

4332
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
out here is like

4333
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
obviously season 4 has

4334
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
been really great like

4335
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
we've been hearing a lot

4336
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
of great feedback from

4337
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
players and you know

4338
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
we're very well aware of

4339
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
like you know how

4340
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
everyone's been enjoying

4341
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
it I think one huge thing

4342
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
that's helped with that as

4343
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
well was like the idea

4344
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
that we had a PTR for

4345
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
season 4 and now we're

4346
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
seeing that again for

4347
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
season 5 so like we know

4348
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
like having that moment

4349
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,000
where players can actually

4350
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
jump in provide feedback

4351
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
give us some notes on

4352
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
specific things is really

4353
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
beneficial especially when

4354
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
we have like new huge

4355
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
features like what we did

4356
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
for season 4 which was

4357
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
you know obviously

4358
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
tempering master working

4359
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
the pit all new hell

4360
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
tides there was a ton of

4361
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
new features and then of

4362
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
course with season 5 you

4363
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
know players are now

4364
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
going to be able to run

4365
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
through infernal horde

4366
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
tons of new gear and

4367
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
legendary aspects for them

4368
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
so it's just like a ton of

4369
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
stuff that we know that we

4370
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,000
can most definitely take

4371
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
feedback on and having

4372
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
those moments has really

4373
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
helped us with some of

4374
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
those decisions

4375
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
yeah I would say on the

4376
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
design team side I know

4377
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
like the people on team

4378
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,000
are very happy with how

4379
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
season 4 went it couldn't

4380
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,000
have gotten better really

4381
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
in our eyes

4382
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
PTR was a huge deal

4383
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
helped us a lot especially

4384
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
on the balance and design

4385
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
side to you know get

4386
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
things into a better place

4387
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
another thing I may call

4388
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
out with season 4 is that

4389
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I don't know how to phrase

4390
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
it like you know there's

4391
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
been a lot of disruption

4392
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
to the game right and so

4393
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
when there's that much

4394
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
disruption of like you know

4395
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
we update all the core

4396
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
math and all the items and

4397
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
everything you know it's

4398
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
very difficult to get

4399
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
things into a fine-tuned

4400
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
state right and you know

4401
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
without giving anything

4402
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
away we have big updates

4403
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
coming in the future with

4404
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
you know expansion and

4405
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
other things but one of

4406
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
the things that we're

4407
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
looking forward to I think

4408
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
as a team is when we've

4409
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
kind of settled down a

4410
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
little bit on the big

4411
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
disruptions like

4412
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
overhauling all of

4413
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
itemization and things

4414
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
like that because you

4415
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
know it becomes a lot

4416
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
more difficult to fine

4417
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
tune things like balance

4418
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
or even on the design

4419
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
side like designs and

4420
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,000
making sure that they

4421
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
work and that we're

4422
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
like iterating and

4423
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
upgrading things versus

4424
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
you know changing things

4425
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
around in huge ways so

4426
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,000
while we think it was

4427
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
really successful and

4428
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
we're happy with how

4429
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
itemization 2.0 turned

4430
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
out the team is looking

4431
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
forward to like making

4432
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
the things as they are

4433
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and make them work

4434
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
better and more do

4435
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
fine-tuning work and so

4436
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I think you can expect

4437
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,000
in the future as a

4438
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
player you know after

4439
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
we've done some more

4440
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
disruption and made the

4441
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
game like in a really

4442
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
good place we're very

4443
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,000
happy with it which we're

4444
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
really close to now I

4445
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
think that you're you

4446
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
know you have tighter

4447
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
class balance tighter

4448
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
designs tighter roles for

4449
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
things and just you know

4450
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
the one of the things

4451
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
that excites me and

4452
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
excited the team about

4453
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
season four was like the

4454
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
tons of quality of life

4455
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
improvements and how

4456
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
much of an impact that

4457
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,000
makes on players which I

4458
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
think we knew but it hit

4459
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
home in season four right

4460
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
like just the codex of

4461
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
power how that changed

4462
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
and how that completely

4463
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
fixed you know the

4464
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
hoarding of items and

4465
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
things like that I think

4466
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
are what really jazz us

4467
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
a lot because it just

4468
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
makes that flow experience

4469
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
better like the boss

4470
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
ladder you know being

4471
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
able to reset bosses

4472
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
stuff like that I think

4473
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,000
is actually really

4474
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
impactful and good for

4475
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
for the longevity of the

4476
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
game so we're excited to

4477
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
do more things like that

4478
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
all right last question

4479
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
that we have here is

4480
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
say it's just Satan's

4481
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
oh Satan's with a Z and

4482
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
666 afterwards very very

4483
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Diablo yeah very Diablo

4484
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
theme is specifically

4485
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
asking what is the

4486
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
seasonal theme are we

4487
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
like holding back any

4488
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
information right now

4489
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
regarding that and stuff

4490
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Dan I don't know if you

4491
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
want to clarify here or if

4492
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
you want me to you can

4493
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
all right so we haven't

4494
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
announced the name for

4495
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
the season yet as far as

4496
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I know but the the

4497
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
seasonal theme seems I

4498
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
guess fairly obvious you

4499
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
know we're going back to

4500
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
hell and so the theme is

4501
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
pretty much returning to

4502
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
hell and while the

4503
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
infernal hordes is just

4504
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
one part of that the

4505
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
rewards are another part

4506
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and when we have our

4507
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
season five live stream

4508
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
we'll go into all of the

4509
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:55,000
rest of the things that

4510
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
we have planned for season

4511
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
five exactly yeah we

4512
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
have we have some yeah

4513
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
we have some we have

4514
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
some additional stuff to

4515
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
talk about when we we do

4516
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
actually have our season

4517
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
five live stream we're

4518
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
just right now the

4519
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
biggest focus for this

4520
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
stream is for people to

4521
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
hear about the content

4522
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:11,000
that they're going to be

4523
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
able to play in PTR and

4524
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
we want people to really

4525
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
hone in and focus in on

4526
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
that so we can actually

4527
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
get that feedback for the

4528
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
team here and we can make

4529
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
any changes that we may

4530
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
need to so but yeah that

4531
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
is kind of going to wrap

4532
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
this up for today for for

4533
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Q&A I'm going to lightning

4534
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
round like a few quick

4535
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
things because I'm sure

4536
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
chat will kill me if I

4537
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
don't call it out sure now

4538
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,000
we're getting a lot of

4539
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
questions about loadouts it

4540
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
is again still something

4541
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
that we are very well aware

4542
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
of and we we still plan on

4543
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
it's just takes a lot of

4544
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
time it's a huge huge amount

4545
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
of overhaul changes and

4546
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,000
