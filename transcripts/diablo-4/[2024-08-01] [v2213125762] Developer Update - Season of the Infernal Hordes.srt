1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We've been saying this whole time that hell is coming.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now, hell is here.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Something that's always present in a Diablo title,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and we wanted to make sure that for Diablo 4,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
returning to hell was a special moment.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We referenced the end-game cinematic with Prava and Inarius

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
taking the fight to hell at the end of the game.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We really wanted to capture that experience,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that sensation of battling throngs of demons in hell.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In the Infernal Quartz, they're going to go into this mode,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
battle waves of demons,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and be able to kind of change the shape of the game experience as you play it.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Those of you who have joined us since Base Game and throughout the seasons

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
will have noticed that we have this phenomenon in the world

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that's going on called Helltides.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Some of you might have noticed that Helltides have been getting a lot worse lately.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And now Hell is able to pierce the veil that's holding Hell back from fully invading Sanctuary

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and starting to take root in Sanctuary.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And we started by asking ourselves some questions.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What is the state of Sanctuary right before the Vessel of Hatred happens?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How has Hell changed now that Mephisto isn't there anymore?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What are the demons up to?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Where is Mephisto? Does he have anything to do with this?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Or is this just Hell rising of its own accord as the prophecy proclaimed?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And so we thought to ourselves,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
how can we make things even worse for the people in Sanctuary?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In this season, you'll very much get to dive into those mysteries

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
with some unlikely allies and really get to the bottom of what's happening.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So in this season, we play a lot with the notion of the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How far would you go to save Sanctuary, to save your world?

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What price would you pay?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Would you sacrifice your soul for this?

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're going to meet a guy named Loughran,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
who at first seems sort of usual,

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but you're going to quickly realize that something is off,

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that something is a little strange with this guy.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So Loughran and Estelle are your allies,

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and they're going to help you return to Hell.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Both of them are experts in demons,

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and they're going to use that knowledge to help you return to Hell

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and become more powerful to be able to battle the Infernal Hordes.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The Infernal Hordes is a new endgame activity in Diablo 4.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's primarily a wave-based activity.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're going to be fighting wave after wave with demon forces in Hell.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So if any of you have ever played wave-based gameplay before,

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you'll know that things escalate.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We've got meteor strikes and all sorts of things

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
that try to keep you on your toes.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
One thing the Infernal Hordes does differently

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
is the notion of Infernal Offers.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In between each wave, you'll make a choice.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You'll be granted an Infernal Offer,

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and by choosing one of three of these offers,

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you're going to change the game mode in some way,

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
a positive and a negative.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can imagine, from the depths of Hell,

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
these hands rise out and offer you both a boon and a bane,

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
a kiss and a curse.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And this is a temptation that the Foul Council is making to you.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And in this temptation, you're offered more power,

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but that power comes at a cost.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so you get to choose, you know,

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
which temptations you're going to pursue during your Infernal Run

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and then customize your experience from there.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
One of the guiding principles of this game mode is replay.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's an in-game mode that we want to make sure

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you're playing over and over again.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So we really wanted to create a broad set of enemies

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
for you to fight during this mode.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We've got many demons to choose from

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
in the lexicon of Diablo's monster families,

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but we're also going to see some other foes you might not expect.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There are going to be certain types of enemies,

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
like goat men who have been banished to Hell,

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that have now rallied to Mephisto and fight by his side.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And even some unlucky souls that marched on Hell

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
from the Cathedral of Light have now been revived in Hell.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and fight against you alongside the demons.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Basically everything that Hell has to throw at you,

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
we're throwing it at you this season.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The Infernal Hordes has been built with multiplayer in mind,

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but multiplayer is not required.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We want to make sure that solo players

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
still have a very fun experience in the Infernal Hordes.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Now that said, if you roll in with a party,

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you're going to have a lot of fun.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This game mode is going to appear in the Eternal

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and in the Seasonal Realm,

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and that means that once the season is over,

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
it's here to stay.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The Infernal Hordes is unlocked at World Tier 3,

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
so really what you need to do to access it

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
is earn your way up to World Tier 3

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and then complete an Eternal questline

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
that takes you back to Hell

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and then unlocks the Infernal Hordes.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
For World Tier 1 and 2 players,

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
we've built out a seasonal progression

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that will help them become more powerful

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
in order to be able to confront the Infernal Hordes.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
First is you can earn reputation,

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and that reputation applies to a reputation track

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
that earns lots of really cool rewards

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
that will make you more powerful

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
as you progress on to World Tier 3.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The other thing we've built are micro dungeons

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
called Hell Breaches

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
that offer a glimpse at the Infernal Hordes mechanics,

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and they give you a chance to learn the mechanics

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
before you confront the Infernal Hordes at World Tier 3.

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The final boss in this season is the Fel Council.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And the Fel Council is some familiar faces

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
that you might recognize from Diablo 2.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
These were priests of the Zacaroon,

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
holy men who were corrupted

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
and basically became vessels of hatred in their own right.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The council members in Diablo 2 tried to help contain Mephisto

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
in his Soul Stone,

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and of course, Mephisto being Mephisto,

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
he was a very strong leader in the world.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He was a very strong leader in the world.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He was a very strong leader in the world.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And of course, Mephisto being Mephisto,

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
slowly but surely corrupted them.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And eventually they had Soul Stones pierced

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
into their hands and became super powerful.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But eventually you overcame them and sent them to Hell.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Through the course of the story, resummon them.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They'd been reborn, slightly new powers,

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
but the same animosity toward you.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's interesting about this boss encounter

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is there are five council members,

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
but you're only going to fight three of them at once.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This allows us to then create many different flavors

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
of the boss fight for the fellow council.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
In fact, it's about ten variations in all.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And so every time you go into that council fight,

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
there's a very good chance you're going to have a different fight

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
than the last time you played it.

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We think it's going to offer a lot of replay for players.

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What we also introduce during these waves

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
are opportunities for you to earn ether.

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Burning ether is the resource that you gather during the infernal hordes

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that you can then spend at the end of the activity.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There's going to be a fixed number of waves that you have to defeat.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And once you've completed all those waves,

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
then you'll face the fell council, defeat them, and collect your treasure.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So upon defeating the fell council, the spoils of Hell will spawn,

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and then you consume your burning ether and opening those chests.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now the trick is when you are playing through these waves,

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
that's your opportunity to earn as much ether as you can.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Different events are going to spawn all throughout the waves,

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
around the periphery of the arena,

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and it's your job to try and defeat as many of those events as possible

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
to try and gather up all the ether you can.

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Really skilled players are going to be able to really maximize that ether

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
so they get the biggest payout possible at the end

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
after defeating the fell council.

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So with this burning ether you'll be able to get new uniques,

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you'll be able to get new legendaries,

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you'll be able to get rare materials,

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
things you might have scoured the whole of Sanctuary for

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
in previous seasons or in the base game,

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
but now we offer it to you here down in the depths of Hell.

165
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A lot of these new uniques and legendaries really build on top of this idea

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that they've been forged in Hell.

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And so they're going to have unique looks that you can then make into cosmetics

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
to apply wherever you like.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They can also have unique VFX and sound effects

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
to really create the sense that they were forged in Hell.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
One particular one that I enjoy using a lot are boots.

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Boots, you say?

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, these boots not only have been forged in Hell,

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
whenever you use a power with a cooldown,

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
they shoot out a ring of fire that hits everyone around you.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's just one sample of the types of powers we're exploring.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So death in the Infernal Hordes is quite a big deal.

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're returning to the Realm of Hatred where Mephisto was born.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Like, this has to be a big deal.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
In the Infernal Hordes, it's a lot like Nightmare Dungeons.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You only get a fixed number of revives in order to be able to get to the end of your run.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So at lower difficulties of the Infernal Hordes,

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
you'll get a number of revives shared between your party.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But at higher difficulty levels, the game is going to start taking away those revives.

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And that increases the stakes that you have.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If you die too much, you'll be ejected from the mode.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
In the Infernal Hordes, we've created a lot of new ways for monsters to ambush the players.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And so I'm pretty stoked to see how our players respond to these.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The seasonal quest line and the eternal quest line, they have lots of little surprises and twists and turns in them.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And there's even some surprises we've buried deep within the Infernal Hordes that hopefully players will have a great time with.

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The Infernal Hordes developer update stream.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hello everyone and welcome to our Season of the Infernal Hordes developer update stream.

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
My name is Marcus Kretz, I'm a community manager here on the Diablo team.

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And today I'm joined by some very familiar faces. Adam and Adam, welcome to the stream.

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, we did it. We took it over.

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We took it over. It's just Adam and Adam show.

197
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Now I don't even have to host. It feels great.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, and for everyone curious in chat, Adam is not going anywhere.

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
As you all know, there's a ton going on in Diablo. Yeah, Adam Fletcher isn't going anywhere.

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Adam Jackson and Adam Fletcher.

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There's a ton going on in Diablo right now. We've had a ton of live streams. There's been so much going on.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So it's just a lot easier to share the load amongst all the hosting live streams.

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We just finished the Spirit Born live stream. So it's been a little crazy.

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And you know, Marcus is here to help out. So you guys may see Marcus more here hosting some live streams in the future.

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But yeah, I'm not disappearing.

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're acting as Colin today.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, exactly. Today I get to pretend I'm Colin.

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Ooh.

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that. Some big shoes to fill there. So yeah.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That is absolutely true.

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
In terms of everything that's been going on in Diablo, we just had our Season of the Infernal Hordes PTR.

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We got a lot of learnings.

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah, but we also do have one additional person.

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Of course we do.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Mr. Dan Dangway from Albany, New York. Dan, welcome to the stream.

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey, how's everyone doing?

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Doing great. Good to see you.

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
See, Dan's in like the Cathedral of Light. We're in like the Burning Hell.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah.

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yeah. It's perfect.

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's hot over here.

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Exactly.

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It tracks.

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah.

225
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Thanks for joining us today, Dan.

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And the Season 5 PTR.

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We've got a lot of learnings.

229
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This was our second PTR for Diablo 4.

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So we have a ton of feedback to get into, but we also have some notes from the community on the PTR overall and some learning.

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So Adam, do you want to walk us through that?

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, most definitely. You know, this is now our second PTR that we had.

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We had one for Season 4 and of course one now for Season 5.

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And, you know, we've learned a lot from these PTRs.

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
PTRs are incredibly important.

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They're huge.

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
They're huge.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They're really beneficial for the whole entire team here.

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And one thing we heard a lot of feedback, at least from the Season 5 PTR, is obviously as you're playing through a PTR, it's a non-final thing that you're playing.

240
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's still very early on.

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah.

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There are going to be more bugs, more issues, just present in the PTR, because we are getting something out there a little bit earlier just so we can get feedback in on it.

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But one thing that I think we most definitely heard from the community is, hey, the tools within PTR at times haven't been the best for the most efficient for players that need to actually test the content that we actually do have.

244
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And so one thing that we did want to at least address and highlight and acknowledge is that, you know, we do plan on making the PTR experiences better in the future.

245
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We do plan on equipping more tools for players out there so they're not having to sit there and grind out, you know, maybe like all the new legendaries or uniques or something like that.

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Especially in like Season 5, for example, we gave a character copy feature in this one.

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And then, of course, we had the boost feature which came back from Season 4.

248
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And when you boosted your character, a new character, you would end up getting some of the new legendaries or uniques within Season 5.

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What happened though is that it wasn't all of them and then we had players within Season 5 having to actually go out and spend their time that they probably could be testing other things like trying to find those items.

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And obviously that's like not the most efficient thing to do.

251
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So we do want to, we hear everyone, we acknowledge it, we do want to make the PTR experience better.

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So I will say that like in future PTRs, and you'll see this gradually over the next couple of PTRs, it won't be all of a sudden like things will be completely different.

253
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But I do expect like, and players should expect like, that we will have better tools for them to properly test as we gradually go through PTRs in the future.

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And we appreciate everyone like letting us know.

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We must definitely hear you guys and we must definitely want to make that experience better from that.

256
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But PTRs have been great.

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Huge thanks to everyone for jumping in and checking it out for sure.

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, definitely.

259
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, that feedback is so important.

260
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So, you know, increasing how great these PTRs are is really, really important.

261
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I know for the Season 5 PTR, one of the huge features that we had in there was the Infernal Hordes itself.

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So for everyone who didn't get a chance to jump into the PTR, Mr. Dan Tanguay, can you kind of walk us through what the Infernal Hordes is and what players can expect?

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, absolutely. I'll give you all a quick recap.

264
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So, the Infernal Hordes is a wave-based activity with push your luck choices in between each of those waves.

265
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So, imagine waves of monsters coming in. Lots and lots of monsters, in fact.

266
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And you also have some events, many events that you can also participate in.

267
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Now, in between those waves, you're going to be making what's called the Infernal Offer.

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And you're going to pick a boon or a bane, and that's going to change your gameplay for the rest of the run.

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So, it allows you to customize what your Infernal Run is going to be like.

270
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And so, we probably see right here, yep, we've got an Infernal Offer that comes up.

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So, you're going to select one of those, and that will then change, of course, the rest of the run.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Now, when you complete the required number of waves, then you're able to go confront the Fel Council, who you can see here.

273
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And the Fel Council, as you saw from the video that just came on right before this livestream,

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
are former servants, well, actually current servants of Mephisto, that you defeated in Diablo II,

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and have now returned, and you must fight them once more.

276
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And once you beat them, you're going to be able to spawn what's called the Spoils of Hell.

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And these are chests that contain a lot of great goodies.

278
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And so, with that Burning Aether you've been collecting all through the course of the mode,

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
you're able to choose what kind of spoils you want.

280
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You've got spoils of legendaries and uniques,

281
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and there's some absolutely great new uniques and legendaries in Season 5,

282
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and you can probably farm about half of them, over half of them, from the Infernal Horts.

283
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're also able to spawn spoils of materials and buy into that,

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and that will get you gem shards, that will get you Angel's Breath,

285
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and of course that'll get you master working materials,

286
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
which you absolutely need to complete your items journey.

287
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You can also cash out and get a bunch of gold,

288
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
which, you know, for those folks who are re-rolling their items in order to masterwork them,

289
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
or to enchant their items, is going to be hugely beneficial.

290
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And then finally, there's a special bonus chest at higher tiers,

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
where you can get a guaranteed roll on a greater affects item.

292
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And so, since that's one of the main chases in the final steps of the endgame,

293
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
we wanted to make sure there was an opportunity for players to really, you know,

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
get a little more lucky with it.

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So, final thoughts on the Infernal Hordes.

296
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Remember that it unlocks at World Tier 3.

297
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You need an Infernal Compass in order to unlock it.

298
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And there's eight levels of difficulty for it.

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And so, yeah, that's a quick recap.

300
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Awesome. Thanks for walking us through, Dan.

301
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Super excited to jump in and try to grab some of those Uniques.

302
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Now, I know, considering the Infernal Hordes was such a big part of PTR,

303
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
we did have a lot of community feedback with regards to, you know, getting into the mode,

304
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
some of the pacing.

305
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So, can you walk us through some of those learnings we had based off the PTR feedback?

306
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, absolutely.

307
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So, there was a lot of feedback that came in.

308
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And so much so that we weren't able to address it all.

309
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But we did distill down some big trends and feedback that we were able to tackle.

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And so, the first off is that we wanted to improve access to the Infernal Hordes.

311
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So, yeah, it was just too hard to get into the mode regularly to test it.

312
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And folks who wanted to get into it very quickly couldn't get into it either.

313
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So, we've pretty much overhauled access to the Infernal Hordes at this point.

314
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Compasses still exist, but the drop rates on those have been boosted quite a bit.

315
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You know, we want you to earn around four or five compasses an hour so that you can do about four or five runs per hour.

316
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So, you know, you've got, you know, 50% chance to get them from item chests and Helltides unless it's one of those item chests that costs, you know, 250 senders, in which case that's 100% chance.

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I mean, you put in the time, we'll just give it to you.

318
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And then, you know, Nightmare Dungeon and Whispers, there's about a 75% chance to get one from a dungeon complete there.

319
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You know, compass tiers at really high levels.

320
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We wanted to make sure drop naturally from high tiered activities like Nightmare Dungeons and the Pit.

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And we've also given you a path to just crafting these outright with the Occultists, with Sigil Power and Forgotten Souls.

322
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And then finally, you know, it was a bug that the first compass that dropped from the Eternal Quest was actually a world tier three.

323
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And if you were playing world tier four, sorry, world tier four, you had to switch back to actually get in the Infernal Hordes.

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And that didn't feel great. So we updated that as well.

325
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Moving along, the next big thing that we focused on was combat.

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The pacing of combat wasn't hitting our goals.

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And, you know, we had done a lot of internal testing on it.

328
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And, you know, folks who weren't as in-game focused gave us a lot of feedback where, you know, oh, this is super intense.

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Could we dial it back a little bit?

330
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So we did.

331
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But then we put it out on PTR and clearly all said, hey, no, we want more.

332
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So we're giving you more.

333
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The first thing that we did, though, is we fixed some bugs that actually happened.

334
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That actually had a really big impact on the experience.

335
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There was a boss health bug.

336
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And that is hard to say.

337
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Boss health bug that caused all the bosses to be super tanky.

338
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And at tier eight, there were some folks who were spending almost an hour's worth of time in the Infernal's Horde.

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And that just that's not what we wanted.

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So we fixed those bugs and retuned everything.

341
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So, you know, it's a much tighter experience at this point.

342
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Similarly, there was a bug where difficulty wasn't scaling appropriate in multiplayer.

343
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So we fixed that.

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And then some tuning things.

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So the pace of many events are pretty much rapid fire at high tiers now, you know, and so you're going to be spinning a lot of plates in this mode.

346
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The monster spawn rates have also been increased to, you know, really capture that feeling of being overwhelmed.

347
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And then finally, we reduced the wave timer down to 60 seconds, which, you know, just creates a much punchier experience for players.

348
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And of course, retuned everything.

349
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And then on top of that, we said, you know what, let's just make it easier for players to pick up burning aether to increase that pace.

350
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So the pets now pick up the burning aether as well.

351
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And that's not all.

352
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Now, of course, you know, we're all playing this for the rewards, right?

353
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And so it was really important for us to improve rewards across the board.

354
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You spend time with the mode, you want to be rewarded appropriately.

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And we weren't hitting that mark in the PTR.

356
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So we raised the minimum amount of burning aether earned from any single run.

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
First off, every single source of aether got boosted by one aether.

358
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And then we added aether drops to the Fel Council so that you're also getting, you know, a lot of bang for your buck just by defeating the boss as well.

359
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And that actually scales per tier as well.

360
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Next up, we retuned all the costs of the Spoils of Hell.

361
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So, you know, the greater equipment, that one with the greater affects in it, used to cost 250.

362
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Now it only costs 60.

363
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Similarly, we retuned the spoils of equipment and the spoils of materials.

364
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So now they only cost 20 aether apiece.

365
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And then finally, we retuned all the rewards that were inside, you know, the the chest as well.

366
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So, you know, at your bare minimum level, when you first start playing the Infernal Hordes and you're not sure exactly how it works, we still want you to feel rewarded just for the time that you invested.

367
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And so the rewards at that bare minimum feel pretty good now.

368
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
But, you know, if you are spending a lot of time with it, you know how to optimize this mode.

369
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We wanted to make sure that, you know, the rewards reflected that, too.

370
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So that that higher, you know, ceiling of rewards has been raised as well.

371
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So you're playing at tier eight.

372
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You are going to get significantly more rewards than you would at tier one.

373
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Awesome.

374
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Awesome.

375
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, that's quite a bit.

376
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's a lot of stuff to change.

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yeah, that's a lot of stuff to change.

378
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I just want to call out.

379
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Dan, your shirt is amazing.

380
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I was going to interrupt, but I didn't want to while he was talking.

381
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm like, now I just want that shirt.

382
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And I'm very jealous that I don't actually own that shirt.

383
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So I will message you after the stream.

384
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You'll let me know where I can get this shirt.

385
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah, I think someone on the team made it.

386
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So I was like, yeah, I needed a new shirt for the live stream.

387
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That is her art.

388
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
100%.

389
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah.

390
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes.

391
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Now we know.

392
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay, now I know.

393
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And it is totally awesome.

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I had to wear it.

395
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It is Aaron.

396
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I totally know.

397
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Aaron, we will be touching base after the stream.

398
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes.

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Dan, that's awesome.

400
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit more.

401
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah, I'm going to be a little bit more.

402
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm going to be a little bit more.

403
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah, I'm going to be a little bit more.

404
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah, I'm going to be a little bit more.

405
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm going to be a little bit more.

406
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I had to wear it.

407
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So it is Aaron.

408
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I totally know.

409
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Aaron, we will be touching base after the stream.

410
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes.

411
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah, Dan, that's a ton of changes.

412
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah.

413
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It sounds like we're really cranking up the intensity for the Infernal Hordes.

414
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Really, really cool to see.

415
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Super excited to jump into it.

416
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So I know for the Infernal Hordes, that's one part of the season that's coming,

417
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
but there was a lot that players didn't get to experience in the PTR that will be coming with the season.

418
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So can you kind of share what's going to be new for players coming into Season 5?

419
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, absolutely.

420
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So the PTR was really focused on features that were on both the Eternal Realm and the Seasonal Realm.

421
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And we have a number of Seasonal exclusive features that you all haven't had a chance to play with yet.

422
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So we're going to tell you about them now.

423
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
First up, we've got the Seasonal Progression.

424
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So you're going to see what we call the Reputation System in some footage here in just a second.

425
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And the Reputation System is something that we had in Season 4 and actually earlier in some events.

426
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And we've brought it back here because it serves as a great backbone for the season.

427
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And we've evolved it in some significant ways.

428
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So first off, how you earn Reputation is a bit different now.

429
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But it was really important for us in Season 5 to give you more of a play,

430
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
give you more choice in how you wanted to earn your Reputation.

431
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So previously in Season 4 you earned Reputation through just playing Helltides, as you should,

432
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
because we made a lot of improvements to Helltides in Season 4.

433
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But here we wanted to broaden it out a bit more.

434
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So you earn Reputation in Season 5 by just defeating powerful servants of Hell.

435
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Elites, Hellborn, champions, bosses, so on and so forth, right?

436
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And so that gives you a lot more choice to say,

437
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Hey, you know, I can earn Reputation in Helltides or I want to earn it in the Infernal Hordes.

438
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Or honestly, I want to take a break and do a stronghold.

439
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You'll get Reputation there too.

440
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Another small tweak that we made that's pretty important is that when you pick up Reputation,

441
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
you actually get a small boost in XP as well.

442
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So as you're continually filling out your Reputation track,

443
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
you're starting to level up just a little more quickly than you did before.

444
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Now, another thing that you might have seen are these big green tiles in the Reputation system.

445
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And those are Seasonal Quests.

446
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So we made it very clear that hitting certain tiers of your Reputation system now unlock the Seasonal Quests.

447
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And it actually starts to weave the narrative through the progression a bit more,

448
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
which we really like the feel of and we hope to build on in the future.

449
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And then finally, you know, again, it's all about the rewards, right?

450
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So there's lots of great returning rewards in the Reputation system.

451
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're going to be able to earn Uniques, specifically class-based Uniques.

452
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
They're going to help you figure out what you want your build to be early on in the season.

453
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You're also going to be able to get other powerful equipment, big drops of crafting materials.

454
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And of course, at the very end of the Reputation track will be a Resplendent Spark that you can use to ultimately craft a Mythic Unique.

455
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Next up, we've got the Seasonal Quest line.

456
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You know, I was teasing it up a little bit with the Reputation system there.

457
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So the Season of the Infernal Hordes has a rather unique narrative flow because we have an Eternal Quest line that introduces, you know, a big new feature that takes you back to Hell, right?

458
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And so we wanted to make sure that was available to everybody, not just Seasonal Players.

459
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And that also starts at World Tier 3.

460
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Now, those of you who played the PTR have already seen it.

461
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That's the one that features Locrin helping you to get back to Hell and confront the Infernal Hordes.

462
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But we've developed an additional secondary, well, not really secondary, an additional seasonal quest line named of Lambs and Wolves, which we're kind of teasing right here.

463
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And new NPC named Estelle is guiding you to become more powerful before you join Locrin to journey back to Hell.

464
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Now, this one's going to be a little closer in tone to the Iron Wolves quest in Season 4, but it's going to be a bit more expansive than that.

465
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And like I said, it weaves in and out of the seasonal progression.

466
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So how do they relate to one another?

467
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Well, the seasonal quest line is exclusive to Season 5.

468
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And so you are able to get a really more complete picture of the story by playing both the seasonal quest line and the eternal quest line.

469
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You can kind of think of the seasonal quest line as almost like a prequel to you unlocking the Infernal Hordes.

470
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And but we also wanted to make sure that our eternal players don't get left out.

471
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
This is an eternal mode that we're introducing after all with the Infernal Hordes.

472
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And so, you know, the infernal or rather the eternal quest line here, which is named Eyes of the Enemy, is going to be available for all players and won't go away after the season end.

473
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So it's going to be there forever. So if you decide sometime down the road that you want to check out the Infernal Hordes and say, I don't know, Season 6, you can do that. Right.

474
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And so, yeah, that's where we ended up with the quest lines this season.

475
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And then the final thing I want to introduce are the Hellbreach dungeons, which we've gotten a few teases of before, but we can go into more detail here.

476
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So these are all new micro dungeons to show that Hell has started taking root in Sanctuary.

477
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Now, since the Infernal Hordes is an endgame activity, World Tier 3+, we wanted to make sure we had some content that targeted our World Tier 1 and 2 players.

478
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And so you go into these, it's going to be a great source of reputation.

479
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's going to be a great place to get some powerful items.

480
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And it's a pretty cool place to just kind of experience what the gameplay is going to be like down the road.

481
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Now, originally we had kind of patterned these off the Donheim tunnels, you know, if you all remember those.

482
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But, you know, with the introduction of Helltide in Season 4, we had to change it up a little bit because I don't think that alone would have sufficed.

483
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And so what we did is we pulled in a lot of elements from the Infernal Hordes, and we're using this as an opportunity to introduce those elements.

484
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So you see right here, we've got a simple Infernal Choice that shows, you know, that basically says, OK, do I want my boss to be a little simpler or a little more difficult?

485
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And you get to choose. Hopefully the person playing chose the more difficult one I didn't see.

486
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But you're going to be rewarded a lot more for taking that risk of making the boss more difficult.

487
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And you're going to be earning Burning Aether. And at the end, there are going to be some spoils that you can spend on.

488
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And like I said, you'll get some really powerful gear that should help you on your journey toward encountering the Infernal Hordes.

489
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So if you want more details on these, I recommend that you check out our blog that came out two days ago. And yeah, thank you.

490
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Dan, that's awesome. I got to say, chat got pretty excited when you mentioned Domain Tunnels. They kind of blew up there.

491
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Definitely a fan favorite. Everyone remembers the Dopamine Tunnels. Yeah. Right, right.

492
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And it's great that there's now like opportunities for players within like World Tier 1 and 2 to actually be able to have other options of leveling up.

493
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And with these new help reaches, it's a good way to tease in the new content. Exactly.

494
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah. Then you get into those Infernal Hordes in World Tier 3 and off away you go. Yeah. That's awesome.

495
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Dan, thanks so much for joining us. As Dan had mentioned, we did publish the Season of the Infernal Hordes blog a little bit earlier this week.

496
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We are going to have patch notes that we'll publish following the stream.

497
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So for any details we reveal across the stream, you can check those out for more information.

498
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Dan's going to join us towards the end of the stream for our Q&A.

499
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So if you have any questions, please drop those in Twitch chat and we'll be pulling them to get into those towards the end of the stream.

500
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So we just touched on a ton of stuff that's coming in Season of the Infernal Hordes itself.

501
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But based off the PTR, we also have a ton of changes coming across Sanctuary.

502
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yes. And to walk us through from the other end of the stream, Mr. Adam Fletcher.

503
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, I get to pretend like I'm the person on the panel.

504
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm going to pull out my... You designed and did all of this?

505
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah, exactly. Put in all the changes.

506
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We have a fantastic design team here and I am going to bring in my inner Colin Feiner.

507
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
To talk about some stuff. But yes, as Marcus mentioned, there's a lot of changes.

508
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
A lot of the stuff that we actually did talk about in the blog and some of the stuff that people heard from PTR.

509
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But there have been changes even since PTR.

510
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah. And we have a few new things in here that we'll also squeak in here as we're talking about it.

511
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:04,000
But one big topic I know that everyone brought up after PTR and that we even brought up even during our PTR stream was Helltides specifically.

512
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
One big topic within Helltides was Baneful Hearts.

513
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
If you guys remember back during the PTR stream, we talked about how Season 4 everyone had a plethora of Baneful Hearts.

514
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I mean, it felt like everyone was always carrying about 100 to 150 at any given time and you can deposit as many into your heart's desire and still always have that same amount.

515
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
We wanted Baneful Hearts to feel a little bit more special.

516
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And so during the PTR we actually did take the number down in terms of how many you would be able to earn.

517
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
We did hear everyone's feedback. People were like, that feels kind of crappy.

518
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So we most definitely readjusted the drop rate of Baneful Hearts to really kind of close that gap in between Season 4 and Season 5 PTR.

519
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
We wanted to make sure that was, you know, it feels better.

520
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Like you won't have 150 on you at all times most likely, but you still have plenty now to be able to summon the Maiden as well.

521
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So some of the changes that we have coming up for Baneful Hearts and the rates that will help with this is we're bumping up the drop rates off of chests within Helltide specifically.

522
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Players will also be able to get a guaranteed heart drop off of Helltide Commanders now.

523
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And then one big thing is within world bosses, yeah, we actually have an image of like where you'll be able to now get your heart drop rates guaranteed, is world bosses.

524
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Sometimes world bosses actually do spawn within a Helltide zone.

525
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And we thought it would be kind of cool that, you know, hey, you killed the world boss there and a Helltide happened to be present in that specific zone where the world boss is.

526
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Now you'll just get a guaranteed 3 within that world boss kill, which is kind of nice.

527
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Sounds super cool.

528
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We're also bumping up the drop chance to like local events, mastery chests within Helltide, and of course Harbingers within it as well.

529
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And then one big change that we're doing within this as well is the blood maiden within world tier 1 and 2 in season 4 and even season 5 PTR, you would have to deposit 3 hearts just like world tier 3 and world tier 4.

530
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
We're actually tweaking that down to just 2 for world tier 1 and 2.

531
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So there'll be one less like altar pedestal for you to deposit a heart for to summon the blood maiden within world tier 1 and 2, which should help out with, you know.

532
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It just makes your farming a little bit quicker in the early levels.

533
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Exactly, exactly.

534
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And it doesn't feel like you're needing to put in that many for those earlier levels.

535
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That much easier to chain a ton of blood maidens back to back to back.

536
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Exactly, yeah.

537
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So next thing we did want to talk about is within Helltides as tortured gifts, another change for world tier 1 and 2.

538
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
There'll be less cinders required to open up the tortured gift chest within world tier 1 and 2.

539
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So it's dropping from 100 to 75 specifically.

540
00:34:48,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And then this is something we talked about in the last stream where it was like really difficult for players to actually kind of go through a Helltide and complete, you know, a full on like, you know, tree of whispers like progression line within Helltide.

541
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So now you'll actually be able to earn all 10 Grim Favors within a Helltide for sure when it's in one subzone.

542
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And actually deposit that within the tree of whispers and get the whisper cash out of it.

543
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I know sometimes it would take like sometimes two Helltides to actually do it.

544
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Or you would have to leave the Helltide and go to a non-Helltide zone to kind of finish it off and stuff.

545
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And so we wanted to make sure that was more efficient specifically within Helltides.

546
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And then this was a big thing.

547
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Big one.

548
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So, you know, we talked about during the season 5 PTR stream that we were, that Profane Mindcages were a season 4 mechanic.

549
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It was only within that.

550
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Well, they were technically.

551
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Yeah.

552
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And so it was, it was removed from season 5.

553
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Heard the feedback.

554
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And people were like, wow, we really missed Mindcages.

555
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Bring them back.

556
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What's going on?

557
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So we did bring them back and we brought them back in like a cooler form.

558
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So now you can actually stack up.

559
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So one, Profane Mindcages are coming back for season 5.

560
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You can actually stack these now up to 3x in season 5.

561
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This is seasonal only.

562
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So this is only on the seasonal realm specifically.

563
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But now stacking up to 3x does actually boost up monster levels for the...

564
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Better rewards.

565
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Better execute.

566
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Better huge.

567
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah.

568
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So you'll end up, you could knock monster levels up, you know, 30 levels if you wanted to.

569
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah.

570
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And you will benefit or maybe suffer.

571
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Or suffer quite a lot, yeah.

572
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But it does give players the option now to use that.

573
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And so Profane Mindcages are back and in a kind of a cooler form for season 5.

574
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah, amazing.

575
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Which is really cool.

576
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And we really appreciate the feedback we heard from players regarding Helltides on that.

577
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So, next overall just general game updates that we do have.

578
00:36:48,000 --> 00:37:02,000
One big thing that we're doing is we are boosting legendary drop rates off of really pretty much almost like all most content like Helltides, Nightmare Dungeons, Infernal Hordes for any monster that is level 100 or higher.

579
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So you'll be able to see and just obtain more legendaries that way, less rares, things like that.

580
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Separately, enchanting.

581
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
One big thing we heard is, you know, people were somewhat, you know, blocked a little bit with Angel's Breath.

582
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And so we did remove Angel's Breath as a cost towards enchanting.

583
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
It's no longer required.

584
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
We've actually now kind of just swapped this over to the respective legendary salvage.

585
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So for instance, armor would be coiling wards, weapons, baleful fragments, and then jewelry, abstruse sigils.

586
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah, tongue twister there.

587
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Abstruse sigils.

588
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Abstruse sigils.

589
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Abstruse sigils.

590
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
But you now have the ability of being able to do enchanting.

591
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Just note that, of course, gold costs are still associated with enchanting.

592
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
But now it's a little bit, removing a little bit of that friction with the Angel's Breath requirement.

593
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And then this is something that we had talked about beforehand, which is just crowd control.

594
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Overall, within Season 5 is going to be a lot better.

595
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I know crowd control can be sometimes painful or either knock down or you're stuck.

596
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah, here, knock down and frozen for a million years and crying and then dying horribly.

597
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And so CC duration has been essentially just pretty much reduced, like, across the board to, like, 1.5 seconds max.

598
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And then one cool feature is you can also spam potions now while you're CC'd.

599
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Really good for, like, you know, people in hardcore or, like, maybe it's, like, it creates more desperate moments of, like, I'm still dying.

600
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
No matter what.

601
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
But you now have the ability of being able to spam potions specifically if you are CC'd, which is really nice.

602
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah.

603
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You know, we were talking about, like, charging, like, somebody for ban-

604
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Bloated Corpse Fiends when they, like, all stun you and they do the Poisoning AOE?

605
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Exactly.

606
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
As a keyboard slammer myself, thank you for that.

607
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yes, exactly.

608
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
For this change.

609
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Next update we have is World Bosses.

610
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So, funny enough, this actually fell into Season 5 PTR, but then we forgot to actually put it in Season 5 PTR notes.

611
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And we actually forgot to actually mention it.

612
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And we got a lot of reports of people going, like, hey, why are World Bosses, like, tankier and harder to kill?

613
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, to fight back now.

614
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Wait, what?

615
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm not used to this.

616
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So they actually had a feature called Resilience on there.

617
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Essentially, Resilience normalizes damage across, like, all World content.

618
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So it's like, if you- shared World content.

619
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So, like, if a bunch of people are all coming into a World Boss, you should expect to find that the World Bosses will be a little bit more tankier,

620
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
a little bit longer in terms of the experience that you're having as you're fighting against them.

621
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah.

622
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And less, you know, like, hey, I blinked and it's gone.

623
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah.

624
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh, sweet. The boss was here for three seconds. Nice.

625
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

626
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Three.

627
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
They barely even spawn in.

628
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It was actually present in PTR.

629
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And we actually got a lot of people that were going, like, hey, I think this is a bug.

630
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And it actually wasn't a bug.

631
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It was just something we forgot to actually mention in the patch notes.

632
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So that is our bad.

633
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But we do want to make sure that everyone's aware that World Bosses now have a feature called Resilience.

634
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And that will end up helping out with those encounters specifically.

635
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Separately for bosses, Pit Boss damage has been reduced pretty much across the board.

636
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And then one big thing that we did want to call out is we got a lot of feedback within, you know, Season 4 and, of course, the PTR for Season 5.

637
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Well, we saw some people address the changes that we were having there.

638
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
But Pit Bosses had this tendency within Season 4 to have, like, very sharp damage.

639
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Yeah.

640
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Where it would scale up really hard and there were times where you would run into a specific Pit Boss and you could potentially just get one shot based off of, like, those, the shadow boss, like, that would appear.

641
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The extra ones coming in.

642
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The extra ones that would come in.

643
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Even when you went to War�� and all of that.

644
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You could go and laugh as they left and you died.

645
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah.

646
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So, now there is a feature within Season 5 where those shadow pit boss, like, affixes will appear.

647
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And they will actually leave kind of a stacking debuff onto players now.

648
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So— and it can go up to three times.

649
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And then, obviously, when it gets to the max, you have a very good chance of getting, like, heavily, like—

650
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Punished.

651
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah.

652
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
—punished for— for taking up to three debuffs from that end.

653
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:23,000
This is really to allow a little bit more flexibility for players, you know, based off of the feedback we heard regarding a lot of the one shots and things like that.

654
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You now have the ability of being able to, you know, take a couple of these debuffs and maybe not like completely get punished from that.

655
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's less about like the perfection kind of involved, but more so being a little bit more forgiving in some of those opportunities.

656
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Now, if you are a person that just like face tanks things and goes in and immediately takes three debuffs, you're probably still going to learn that, you know, that damage is still going to be very sharp with the three debuffs.

657
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But it is something to help out in regards to that.

658
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
To be clear how that debuff works is every time that you get hit with one of those shadow boss mechanics, you'll take the debuff and it increases all of your damage taken.

659
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So the regular boss is going to hit you harder and the shadow bosses are going to hit you harder too.

660
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Exactly.

661
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So, you know, you just don't want that to ramp up too much because then everything is going to be more punishing.

662
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah.

663
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Exactly.

664
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
There's a few people already asking about those debuffs in chat.

665
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah.

666
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It just increases all your damage taken.

667
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So basically, you know, you get some freebies of getting hit by them.

668
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You really don't want to, but then after that, you got to watch out because then it's about as hard as Season 4 was.

669
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Exactly.

670
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So, and then another big thing.

671
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So this was something that was actually not present in the PTR, but it's something that we've heard a lot of feedback about and actually a ton of feedback about.

672
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And this is group play in pits.

673
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:50,000
In Season 4, the way that it worked was if you were in the pit and you were the party leader and you had three friends that joined along, you would essentially get through the pit.

674
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You would get all the master working materials for yourself, 100% of them.

675
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And then everyone else that joined you would only get about like 50%.

676
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And it felt pretty punishing for people to really kind of join up with friends and run through pits.

677
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And we heard a lot of feedback of like, hey, it'd be great if I'm just joining my friend, we can all just get, you know, 100% of the pit material rewards.

678
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And so that is being tweaked for Season 5.

679
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Now the whole entire party itself will end up receiving 100% of the materials that you end up receiving at the end of the pit.

680
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But so we appreciate the feedback.

681
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Thank you guys for letting us know.

682
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And this is something that wasn't in PTR but will be for Season 5.

683
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Next up, we have endgame bosses.

684
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So this is something, of course, we talked about during the PTR.

685
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And we do want to highlight again because I think this is amazing and will save a whole lot of time.

686
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So nice.

687
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You can now resummon endgame bosses immediately after you end up killing them.

688
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So as you're going through the different boss ladders and stuff, you can just resummon.

689
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The altar will reappear as you can see in the footage.

690
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And throw in the mats and bam.

691
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Again, you're fighting Durial which is really nice.

692
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
No more exiting the dungeon, resetting the dungeon, running back and then having to do it over again.

693
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
This should save up a whole lot of time.

694
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
This should help a whole lot with farming as well, specifically for gear.

695
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And you'll be hearing a lot about all this new gear from Adam here in a second.

696
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But there were some additional changes as well to some of the endgame bosses that we do have.

697
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Like, for instance, the first one we're going to talk about is the Beast and Ice.

698
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
The Beast and Ice, of course, required a sigil to actually summon.

699
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Or to actually create the dungeon to go in to fight the Beast and Ice.

700
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
There's no longer a sigil that will be required.

701
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And also the Beast and Ice is now way closer to the dungeon.

702
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And it's going to be a short dungeon crawl similar to the other endgame bosses.

703
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So you're not having to, you know, go through a lengthy dungeon just for that.

704
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah, a whole dungeon just to get to the boss.

705
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah.

706
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Likewise, no more sigil dust will be required for summoning the Beast and Ice.

707
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And then, of course, we thought about internal players in this situation.

708
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Because some of them have actually crafted a bunch of sigils.

709
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And now since sigils are no longer required, you can still use those leftover sigils to immediately resummon the Beast and Ice without needing the mats that are still required for the Beast and Ice.

710
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So it's kind of a nice benefit to them.

711
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And then, of course, Varshan also got some updates.

712
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Varshan required a bunch of different body parts.

713
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And now Varshan just requires malignant hearts.

714
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And, of course, we thought about eternal players in this specific instance.

715
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Eternal players can convert their old body parts to hearts by going to the Alchemist.

716
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That's a magical Alchemist.

717
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I get it.

718
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Wow.

719
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
But if you ever need a spare heart, you just go to an Alchemist.

720
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That's just how it works.

721
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Swap it out.

722
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah, that's just how it works.

723
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
But, yeah, some changes coming to that.

724
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And then, separately, endgame bosses, for endgame bosses, the Boss Ladder bosses, they won't be dropping rare items anymore.

725
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
They're actually just going to drop additional gold.

726
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And, of course, you'll have your opportunity of getting legendaries and uniques and mythic uniques from them.

727
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
But now we just remove the rare item drops from them.

728
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So it takes up, like, less of the drop chances that you could get in terms of their specific tables.

729
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And then on tormented bosses, tormented bosses now drop five times as many boss mats as before.

730
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And, of course, all tormented bosses have a better chance of dropping a mythic uniques.

731
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So we are boosting up the mythic uniques drop.

732
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
There's actually specifics on all this stuff in the patch notes that people can read afterwards.

733
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And we've also reduced the Stygian stone cost for the tormented bosses.

734
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Before it was two, and now it's dropping to one.

735
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So it should help out with players wanting to experiment or try out some of the more difficult endgame bosses that are available,

736
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
which are their tormented versions.

737
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And then one big thing that is happening, and this is something that was kind of mentioned in the blog,

738
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:03,000
and people will see more specifics in the patch notes, experience is changing in terms of, like, the XP bonus from killing higher level monsters.

739
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's no longer capped in, I believe it's now, well, it's...

740
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I think it used to be ten levels higher.

741
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You didn't get more?

742
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It's so capped, shall I say.

743
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It's capped to 30 levels.

744
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
That's actually incorrect on the slide.

745
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
But it used to be ten levels.

746
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It's now 30 levels.

747
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And that's across all world tiers.

748
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So if you have...

749
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
For example, if you are a level 50 character,

750
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and you kill a level 80 monster in Season 4,

751
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
you would only get a level 60 experience.

752
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Up to level 60 credit.

753
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Now you'll get up to that level 80 experience.

754
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
So it should help out a lot.

755
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
If you are willing to go through more challenging content,

756
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
man, you get more XP for it, which is really cool.

757
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And it's also really nice because it plays really well into stacking profane mine cages,

758
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
which are not available within Helltide because that can actually also increase monster level by 30 levels as well.

759
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So it's kind of a cool little add-on, you could say, from this.

760
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So yeah.

761
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Pretty sweet.

762
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah.

763
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I think that's it for general game updates.

764
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah.

765
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Holy smokes.

766
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Oh my God.

767
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
That's it.

768
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Holy moly.

769
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Yeah.

770
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
As I talked about a bunch.

771
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah.

772
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It's all on the patch notes.

773
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
You guys will see the patch notes afterwards.

774
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
But yeah.

775
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yeah.

776
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Really amazing to have all those changes.

777
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Chat was absolutely lighting up.

778
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Cool.

779
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Good.

780
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
With regards to all the changes to the pit.

781
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And of course, even though we've shown the boss summoning reset again,

782
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
they got just as excited.

783
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Awesome to see.

784
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And we really appreciate everyone's feedback during PTR

785
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
and hearing especially about the Helltide stuff.

786
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And we totally hear you guys.

787
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And we want to make sure that people have to experience,

788
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
still enjoy Helltide to the fullest.

789
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You know what I mean.

790
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Exactly.

791
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No, it's really cool to see those.

792
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I talked too much.

793
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Yeah, those profane mind cages coming back.

794
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But yeah, Adam, thank you so much for that.

795
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah.

796
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And now, everyone, I hope you're comfortable

797
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
because we've got a ton to go over with regards to updates,

798
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
uniques, some bugs fixes, a ton of class balance changes.

799
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Who better to walk us through, Mr. Adam Jackson?

800
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah, let's do it.

801
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So we've got a lot to talk about today.

802
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I'll try and go as quickly as possible.

803
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So yeah, firstly, thank you all for your feedback and comments.

804
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You know, we got a lot of class-related feedback on the PTR,

805
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
a lot of balance feedback, a lot of just how it feels to play things.

806
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And we actually reacted pretty heavily and did a lot of changes between PTR and Season 5 launch,

807
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
some of which I think some people know,

808
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and some things are going to be new for you today.

809
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Okay.

810
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So really, yeah, we have a lot of things that changed.

811
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
In many ways, honestly, it's going to feel like almost from a balanced perspective

812
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and kind of what your class can do in your journey,

813
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
it's going to feel almost like a very different game

814
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
compared to what you experienced on the PTR.

815
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I'm going to go through a lot of like the systemic reasons why

816
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and then some specific things that we did to every class

817
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
as well as, of course, updating all of our uniques

818
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and kind of the impact that you can expect from that.

819
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So lots to talk about.

820
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So first, we're going to be talking about bug fixes.

821
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
We've got quite a few to go through that I think are pretty notable.

822
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Again, we're going to be doing the class balance updates after that

823
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
and then the unique changes.

824
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So those will be the three things I'm going to be covering today.

825
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So firstly, as usual, you know,

826
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
we're going to be publishing the patch notes right after this

827
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
so you can read all of them.

828
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'm not going to cover everything today,

829
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
but just some of the more notable ones.

830
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So first is one on the Necromancer that we've heard about for a while now.

831
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It's Shielding Storm.

832
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
This is legendary that when your Bone Storm damages enemies,

833
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
you get a barrier equal to your max life.

834
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It used to be based on your base life instead of your max life,

835
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and now we finally fixed that.

836
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
To be clear, this is a pretty huge buff.

837
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We may have to reevaluate the power of this a little later,

838
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
but we're going to see how it goes.

839
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
But now that barrier is going to be very significant

840
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
as you're hitting enemies with this aspect.

841
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Next, we've got a couple on the Barbarian.

842
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
The first one is the Twister Glyph.

843
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
This is a Paragon Node Glyph.

844
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It wasn't properly giving you bonus multiplicative damage

845
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
when casting dust doubles,

846
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
so dust double builds will be a little bit stronger.

847
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
We also fixed an issue with the tempering earthquake duration.

848
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Beforehand, there was a bug

849
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
where it was actually lowering the DPS of earthquake

850
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
because it would increase the duration,

851
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
and then your DPS would go down.

852
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So we fixed that.

853
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So it's now actually just going to make you hit harder.

854
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Next one, I'm going to call out one of our content creators, Woody Joe, here.

855
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
This is why we have PTR.

856
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
He found a neat little oversight that we had

857
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
with a passive called Trick Attacks,

858
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and I'm actually going to go over this in a little bit of detail

859
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
because this is going to be coming a little later.

860
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Rank 39 out of 3 seems completely normal.

861
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah, 39 ranks of offensive passive is pretty good.

862
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So a little bit of background to this.

863
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Basically, we changed how this passive Trick Attacks,

864
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
what it does.

865
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It went from something that was more utility-based

866
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
where it was around CC,

867
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and we turned it into damage.

868
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But we didn't update under the hood for tempering

869
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and where it can appear from a utility to a damage recipe

870
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
of where it would show up.

871
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And so it was appearing on utility,

872
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
which is a lot more common than damage,

873
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
and then you could get it to silly ranks like this.

874
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So to fix this,

875
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
right now, or on the PTR, I should say,

876
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
it was on this recipe called Alchemist Control

877
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
where it was with Chilling Weight and Shadow Crash,

878
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
which were also like CC-based passives.

879
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
For Season 5 launch,

880
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
we're actually going to be disabling this recipe from dropping.

881
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
You won't be able to see it for a patch

882
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
while we fix this bug.

883
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And what we're going to do is,

884
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
once we re-enable the Alchemist Control recipe to drop,

885
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Trick Attacks won't be on here anymore.

886
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
What we're actually going to be doing

887
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
is we're going to be taking Flurry Size

888
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
from another recipe called Rogue Innovation here.

889
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
We're going to be moving Flurry Size,

890
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
which is more of a utility-based thing,

891
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and moving that over to Alchemist Control,

892
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and then just removing Trick Attacks from Alchemist Control.

893
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
So the net effect of this will be that

894
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
now both tempering recipes will have three different options

895
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
of what you can have there,

896
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and Rogue Innovation will actually have a little bit of a buff here too

897
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
because instead of having four things to roll for your tempers,

898
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
we're only going to have three.

899
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So it'll be a little bit easier to get what you want.

900
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Next, we're going to be talking about

901
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
some generic class balance updates.

902
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So kind of to set you up,

903
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
a high-level theme that we're going to see

904
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
in our feedback from PTR was

905
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Barbarians are really, really good,

906
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
and oh, every other class is kind of a little bit weak,

907
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
it feels like, compared to Barbarians.

908
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So we did a lot of things to address this.

909
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So first I want to go into detail a little bit

910
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
of how we feel about Barbarians

911
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
and where they're at and what we want to do.

912
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
We feel like one of the bigger reasons

913
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
why Barbarians are so strong

914
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
is that they kind of have two class mechanics

915
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
compared to other classes, right?

916
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
They have the Expertise System,

917
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
which is like a normal class mechanic

918
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
where, you know, they have this fantasy

919
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
of leveling up their weapons,

920
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and then they get bonuses.

921
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But then they also get more item slots

922
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
compared to other classes

923
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
so they get more access

924
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
to more legendary powers.

925
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
As far as how we tackle this,

926
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
we don't want our only solution

927
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
to be the nerf Barbarians, right?

928
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Like a common thing that we hear is like,

929
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
hey, they have more item slots,

930
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
maybe you should just get rid of the item slots

931
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
so that everybody has parity, right?

932
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Like that is a way to make parity,

933
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
but, you know, it takes away from their theme

934
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
of being a master of weapons,

935
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
and it's not very fun.

936
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So that's not the only thing

937
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
that we want to do in this situation.

938
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
The other thing is that we want to keep

939
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
their class identity, right?

940
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Another common suggestion we hear is,

941
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
well, just give all the other classes

942
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
more item slots so that they're the same

943
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
as Barbarian, right?

944
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And similarly, kind of like how

945
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Necromancers have minions,

946
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
we don't want to give every class minions

947
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
just because, you know,

948
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
they don't have access to the cool thing

949
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
that Necromancers do.

950
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
We don't want to just give every class,

951
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
you know, more slots so that they're

952
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
exactly the same as Barbarian.

953
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
We want to really try and keep

954
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
what makes them feel special

955
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
as a special thing

956
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
and find other ways to kind of bring

957
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
parity to the classes.

958
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So here's kind of our strategy

959
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
of what we're thinking of with Barbarians.

960
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
We have a few different things

961
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
that we're going to be doing.

962
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
One is we're actually going to be adjusting

963
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
how much damage all the classes get

964
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
from their core stat,

965
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and this is going to bring other classes

966
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
up to the level of Barbarian.

967
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I'm going to be going over that

968
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
in a little bit.

969
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
We are going to be reducing

970
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
the power of Barbarians

971
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
as part of our solution,

972
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
but again, I want to point out

973
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,000
it's not the only thing

974
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
that we want to do.

975
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And then we also want to target

976
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
the other class mechanics

977
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and really bring them up

978
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
to the level of the Barbarian

979
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
effectively having too

980
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
and making the other classes

981
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
feel cool in the way

982
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
that makes them thematic and awesome.

983
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
We already actually experimented

984
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
with this in Season 4.

985
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
This was an intentional thing

986
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
that we did,

987
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
and we wanted to see how it went

988
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
with the Necromancer.

989
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
If you remember,

990
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
we buffed minions very heavily,

991
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and we also buffed

992
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
the Book of the Dead,

993
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
their class mechanic,

994
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,000
very heavily.

995
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Not just numbers,

996
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
but also in the cool factor, right?

997
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
You have mechanics like,

998
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,000
you know, your minions

999
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
can throw bone spears,

1000
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,000
or, you know,

1001
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
your golem can do bone spikes

1002
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
everywhere and make enemies vulnerable.

1003
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
We want to do this kind of treatment

1004
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
to the other class mechanics.

1005
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Just to be clear,

1006
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
we're going to be probably doing this

1007
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
after the Vessel of Hatred expansion launches,

1008
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
so it'll be a little bit.

1009
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So we are doing some things

1010
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
in the meantime to catch them up,

1011
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
but you can expect in the future

1012
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
we're going to be doing

1013
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
kind of a big overhaul

1014
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
to the other classes

1015
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
similarly to the Book of the Dead,

1016
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
and so their cool factor

1017
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and their power level

1018
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
is going to be going up.

1019
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So let's talk about that core stat update

1020
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
that I talked about previously.

1021
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So basically what we're doing here

1022
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
is we're going to be changing

1023
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
the amount of damage

1024
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
that every class gets

1025
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
from their core stat.

1026
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So if you didn't know,

1027
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
on live right now,

1028
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
when you log into the game,

1029
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
you get about 1% more damage

1030
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
per 10 stat of your class.

1031
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So as an example,

1032
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
you know, the, I don't know,

1033
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
pick one, the Sorceress,

1034
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
you know, with Intelligence,

1035
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
you would have 10 int,

1036
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and then you would get 1% more damage.

1037
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
If you had 100 int,

1038
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
you'd have 10% more damage,

1039
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and so on.

1040
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So now it's going to actually

1041
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
depend on the class

1042
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
what that ratio is

1043
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
of how much damage you get

1044
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
per your core stat.

1045
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
So the Barbarian is going to be saying

1046
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
exactly the same,

1047
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
1% more damage per 10 strength.

1048
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
The Rogue is going to get

1049
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
a little bit of a buff here

1050
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
because they do have

1051
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
a little bit more slots

1052
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
compared to other classes,

1053
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,000
so they're going to be getting

1054
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
1% more damage per 9 decks.

1055
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And then the other three classes,

1056
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000
the Sorceress, Druid,

1057
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
and Necromancer,

1058
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,000
are going to be getting

1059
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
1% more damage

1060
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
per 8 core stat.

1061
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So, you know,

1062
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
without doing a lot of math,

1063
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the TLDR here is

1064
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Barbarians are staying the same,

1065
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Rogues are going to get

1066
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,000
a bit of a bump,

1067
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,000
a bit of a buff,

1068
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
and the other three classes

1069
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
are going to get

1070
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
even more damage.

1071
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So as you get that core stat,

1072
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
which you get very commonly,

1073
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,000
you know,

1074
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
in Gear and Paragon

1075
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,000
and other places,

1076
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000
you're just going to be

1077
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
doing more damage.

1078
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's just a passive way

1079
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,000
that we're going to be

1080
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
catching up the classes

1081
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
stat-wise.

1082
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So next,

1083
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,000
let's move on

1084
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
to kind of our class updates.

1085
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So I'm going to be going

1086
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
through all the different classes

1087
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and talking about

1088
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
kind of what our updates

1089
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
are going to be for them,

1090
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,000
some of the things

1091
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
you can expect

1092
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
that are different

1093
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
from PTR to launch.

1094
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,000
So Barbarian,

1095
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
you know,

1096
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
currently Barbarians,

1097
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
in addition to having

1098
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
more item slots,

1099
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,000
have some of the best

1100
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
key passives in the game

1101
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
like in Season 4

1102
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
and on live.

1103
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
One of the very main ways

1104
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
that we're targeting

1105
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
bringing them down

1106
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
is reducing the power level

1107
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
so that really

1108
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,000
their key passives

1109
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
are comparable

1110
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
to other classes.

1111
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
We on the team felt like,

1112
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,000
you know,

1113
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,000
they already have

1114
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
all these other things

1115
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
that are really strong

1116
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,000
going for them.

1117
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
They don't need,

1118
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,000
like,

1119
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,000
overly-statted,

1120
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
way-powerful key passives

1121
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
that do, like,

1122
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,000
you know,

1123
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
over 100% multiplicative damage

1124
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
when the other classes

1125
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
are doing way less.

1126
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So you did see that

1127
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
on the PTR.

1128
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
We did see a lot of feedback

1129
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
on, like,

1130
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
why are we bringing down

1131
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Walking Arsenal

1132
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
to have parity

1133
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
when, you know,

1134
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
it wasn't even really meta

1135
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
compared to the other

1136
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,000
key passives.

1137
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And I just kind of wanted

1138
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,000
to bring some light

1139
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
to this of how we think

1140
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000
about it.

1141
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The reason why we brought

1142
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Walking Arsenal

1143
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
to be level with the other ones

1144
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
when we brought them

1145
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
to be equal to other classes

1146
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
is that, you know,

1147
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
we want all the key passes

1148
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
on Barbarian

1149
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
to have parity with each other.

1150
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
If we just brought down

1151
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
the other key passes

1152
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
that were way over-performing

1153
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
and didn't bring

1154
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Walking Arsenal down

1155
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
to be even with them,

1156
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
then really Walking Arsenal

1157
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,000
is just going to be

1158
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
the best mandatory pick

1159
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
and every Barbarian build

1160
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
is going to have to interact

1161
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,000
with this system.

1162
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And we really wanted them

1163
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
to be equal with each other

1164
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
so that, you know,

1165
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
there's actually a choice

1166
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
when you get to your key passive

1167
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
of which one to take.

1168
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
So I just wanted to clarify that

1169
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,000
of, you know,

1170
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
what our thinking was there.

1171
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
But, you know,

1172
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
it's not all doom and gloom

1173
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
for Barbarians.

1174
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You know,

1175
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
we did hear feedback

1176
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,000
of like,

1177
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
man, it really sucks.

1178
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,000
You know,

1179
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I understand that they're

1180
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,000
being brought down

1181
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
and it's fair,

1182
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
but, you know,

1183
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,000
we want to have some things

1184
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
to look forward to.

1185
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So we did introduce

1186
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,000
a number of buffs

1187
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
coming in between PTR and live

1188
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
so that you have some things

1189
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
to look forward to

1190
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
and new build paths

1191
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
or your, you know,

1192
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
underperforming builds

1193
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
are not being brought down

1194
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,000
as well.

1195
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So I'm going to give

1196
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
a couple of examples here.

1197
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
One is Hammer of the Ancients.

1198
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
We increased its damage

1199
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
baseline by 10%.

1200
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And we also adjusted

1201
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
the Of Ancestral Force legendary.

1202
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
One of the troubling things

1203
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
that this build has problems with

1204
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
is like single target damage

1205
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
against bosses and things.

1206
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You know,

1207
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
it does really good in AoE

1208
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
and brings down enemies,

1209
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,000
but its single target

1210
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
is a little bit lacking.

1211
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So we're upgrading

1212
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
this legendary power.

1213
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
So now it's going to be doing

1214
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
more damage against bosses.

1215
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So it'll kind of help you

1216
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
with that single target issue.

1217
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Another one is Upheaval.

1218
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Upheaval builds can rejoice

1219
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
and also a little bit of a preview

1220
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
of kind of how we're changing

1221
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,000
uniques,

1222
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
which I'll be going over

1223
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
a lot more later.

1224
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
But we're increasing

1225
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Upheaval damage by about 15%.

1226
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And we also rounded out

1227
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Hellhammer now.

1228
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It's quite a bit more powerful.

1229
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I can point out a bunch of things here

1230
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
of how it's better.

1231
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But you can see

1232
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
it gives more skill ranks

1233
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
of upheaval compared to before.

1234
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
The damage of its burning

1235
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
on the ground

1236
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
just baseline went up.

1237
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
It also has scaling

1238
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
on the burning damage.

1239
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So, you know,

1240
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
before the burning damage

1241
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
wasn't really a meaningful

1242
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
part of the unique.

1243
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
One of the things

1244
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,000
you're going to see

1245
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
with uniques across the board

1246
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
is that they're going to be

1247
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
a lot more about

1248
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,000
the thematic

1249
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
of what the unique is.

1250
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And that's where their power

1251
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
is going to be.

1252
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So here,

1253
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,000
the burning ground

1254
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
actually will scale

1255
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
with your strength

1256
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
at a pretty significant degree.

1257
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,000
So, you know,

1258
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
it'll actually be doing

1259
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
meaningful damage, hopefully.

1260
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You can also see

1261
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
its inherent affix now

1262
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
is damage to burning enemies

1263
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
instead of overpower damage.

1264
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So it's going with that theme

1265
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
of Hellhammer

1266
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
burning the ground.

1267
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's also giving you

1268
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
skill ranks of wall up,

1269
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
a passive.

1270
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So that's more multiplicative damage.

1271
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
You also get upheaval size.

1272
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So now your burning ground

1273
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,000
and your upheaval

1274
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
is going to be bigger.

1275
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So there's just all kinds

1276
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
of new things going on.

1277
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's going to be a lot cooler,

1278
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
a lot more powerful,

1279
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
and hopefully a lot more fun.

1280
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah, Hellhammer

1281
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
looks absolutely insane.

1282
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yeah.

1283
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
300 strength also,

1284
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,000
by the way,

1285
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
no big deal.

1286
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,000
300 strength,

1287
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
no big deal.

1288
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,000
360 strength,

1289
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
no big deal.

1290
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,000
No big deal.

1291
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It's going to be pretty good.

1292
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
So next,

1293
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
the Sorceress.

1294
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
We got a whole lot of feedback

1295
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,000
that, you know,

1296
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
the Sorceress isn't powerful enough

1297
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
compared to other classes.

1298
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
We got so much.

1299
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I'm going to stop us right here.

1300
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
We got so much feedback

1301
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
about the Sorceress.

1302
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Just a little bit.

1303
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
And the Druid.

1304
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And the Necromancer.

1305
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I will just note,

1306
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,000
like,

1307
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
we hear you guys.

1308
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
We absolutely do.

1309
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah.

1310
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Okay,

1311
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
now you may continue.

1312
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Okay.

1313
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So,

1314
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
for the Sorceress specifically,

1315
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,000
we heard feedback

1316
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
that they're not powerful enough.

1317
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So we did quite a few things

1318
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
to address it.

1319
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Firstly,

1320
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
they've got a lot of large buffs

1321
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
to their Uniques.

1322
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I would say even more

1323
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
than other classes.

1324
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Your Uniques are going to feel

1325
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
really good,

1326
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
is the hope,

1327
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
and I think we've hit it.

1328
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And I'll be going over

1329
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
some of them a little bit later.

1330
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
We also buffed

1331
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
all of their Core and Mastery skills

1332
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
by about 15 to 20%.

1333
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
So just baseline.

1334
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Remember,

1335
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
this is in addition

1336
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
to the Core stat buff.

1337
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
All of your Core and Mastery skills

1338
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
are also getting buffed baseline

1339
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
by a pretty significant degree.

1340
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So you're just going to hit harder.

1341
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
We also did multiple defensive buffs.

1342
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You know,

1343
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
we heard a lot of feedback

1344
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
that they have trouble surviving

1345
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
in situations

1346
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,000
that the other classes

1347
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
could kind of get away with.

1348
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
These are some examples.

1349
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
We did more than this.

1350
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
But Ice Armor,

1351
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
your base shield amount

1352
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
is going up from 40%

1353
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
to 56% of your max life.

1354
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Snow Veiled aspect.

1355
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
This one was updated

1356
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
from PTR to launch.

1357
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So on PTR,

1358
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
it was that your Ice Armor

1359
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
gave you Unstoppable

1360
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
and gave you Armor.

1361
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And on launch,

1362
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
you're still going to get Unstoppable,

1363
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,000
but you're going to get

1364
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
damage reduction,

1365
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
which anyone who knows

1366
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
how the defenses

1367
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
within this game work

1368
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
is way more significant

1369
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
than just getting Armor.

1370
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Yeah.

1371
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
When you hit that Armor cap,

1372
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
it's kind of like...

1373
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Yeah, you just want to

1374
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
gobble up DR like Pac-Man.

1375
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
As much as you can get,

1376
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
the more the better,

1377
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
and this is going to give you...

1378
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Yeah, the DR is going to be huge.

1379
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Very big.

1380
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Very big.

1381
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Also, we did multiple buffs

1382
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
to the Paragon board.

1383
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Again, this is not covering everything.

1384
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
But one of the things

1385
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
is that we put a lot of caps

1386
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
to make sure that

1387
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
some Paragon O's

1388
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
just didn't go out of control

1389
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
compared to everything else.

1390
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
But we heard feedback

1391
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,000
that those caps

1392
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
were a little bit too punishing.

1393
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So we increased them.

1394
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
An example here

1395
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
is Burning Instinct,

1396
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
where on PTR,

1397
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
it capped at 40%

1398
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
more multiplicative damage.

1399
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And we increased that

1400
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
up to 80%.

1401
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So now your Burning damage,

1402
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
that's based on your Crit Strike,

1403
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
multiplier,

1404
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
is going to be going up.

1405
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Your total amount

1406
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
is going to go up.

1407
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But then also,

1408
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
the rate that you get it.

1409
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It used to be 1% per 50 int.

1410
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Now it's 1% per 20 int.

1411
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So you'll be getting

1412
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
more efficient

1413
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,000
paying for your buck

1414
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
for your int

1415
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
and a total cap

1416
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that's much higher.

1417
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
So Druid,

1418
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
similar to Sorceress,

1419
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
surprise, surprise,

1420
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
got a lot of feedback

1421
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
that it's not powerful enough

1422
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
compared to the Barbarian

1423
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,000
or other classes.

1424
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
So we've got

1425
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
a lot of multiple quality of life

1426
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and damage buffs coming in.

1427
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Again, these are just some examples.

1428
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Also, you've got to remember

1429
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,000
the Uniques

1430
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
are going to be coming in as well.

1431
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Boulder damage went up.

1432
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,000
We increased the damage

1433
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
across the board

1434
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
of their core skills mostly

1435
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
and we missed Boulder.

1436
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So we're increasing

1437
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,000
their damage a bit.

1438
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
We also got a lot of feedback

1439
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
that we came out

1440
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,000
with this really cool

1441
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Unique for Cataclysm

1442
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
that made the Lightning Bolts

1443
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
smart and target enemies.

1444
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And a lot of people

1445
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
were like,

1446
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
hey, why does it have to

1447
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
get a Unique

1448
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
to make my skill be smart?

1449
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And we agreed.

1450
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
So we just made

1451
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
the skill smart baseline.

1452
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So now those Lightning Bolts

1453
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
from the ultimate

1454
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
will just target enemies.

1455
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Perfect Storm.

1456
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
The Storm key passive

1457
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
is getting its damage

1458
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
boosted from 30% to 40%.

1459
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Seismic Shift.

1460
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,000
This was an aspect

1461
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
that we think is really cool

1462
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
where your Earth Spike

1463
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
kind of goes in a line

1464
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
and does a bunch of Earth Spikes.

1465
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Used to have a Kiss Curse mechanic

1466
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and it no longer does.

1467
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So before it used to

1468
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
give you this big bonus

1469
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
of way more resource reduction

1470
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
and more damage on it.

1471
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
But it added a cooldown.

1472
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And now it just doesn't

1473
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,000
add a cooldown

1474
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
so you can spam it

1475
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
and cast a bunch

1476
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
of Earth Spikes everywhere.

1477
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Should be a lot more fun.

1478
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Also similar to the Sorceress,

1479
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
we're buffing their

1480
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
little bonus cap

1481
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
on their Legendary Paragon nodes.

1482
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
So an example here,

1483
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,000
you know they went

1484
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
from 40% to 60%.

1485
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
So you've got Thunderstruck,

1486
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Earthen Devastation,

1487
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and Survival Instincts.

1488
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
We've got a little visual there

1489
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
at the bottom node

1490
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
but you can see that

1491
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
that top end of the damage

1492
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
is now 60%.

1493
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So it's going to be

1494
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
better than PTR.

1495
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Also we came out

1496
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,000
with that new Unique

1497
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I mentioned for Cataclysm.

1498
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It used to be on the gloves

1499
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
on PTR which a lot of people,

1500
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
which we agreed with,

1501
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
you know it kind of felt bad

1502
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
that you've got

1503
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
the two Storm-related Uniques

1504
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
on the same slot

1505
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and you can't take them together.

1506
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
It was competing

1507
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
with Unsun Aesthetics Wraps.

1508
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
This was the Lightning Storm Unique.

1509
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
But now it's going to be

1510
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,000
on the ring slot

1511
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
so now you can take them

1512
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:55,000
both together

1513
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
so they're not competing

1514
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
with each other anymore.

1515
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Next is the Rogue.

1516
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
So to be frank,

1517
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,000
the Rogue is,

1518
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
we feel like it's

1519
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
in a pretty good spot

1520
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
so we didn't do

1521
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,000
as many changes

1522
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
compared to other classes.

1523
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
We did still do a few

1524
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
that I'll mention today

1525
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
but they got the least changes.

1526
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
The first one is Flurry.

1527
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
So as you know

1528
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
if you played the PTR,

1529
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Flurry got some

1530
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
pretty dramatic updates, right?

1531
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Both of their enhancement

1532
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
and both of their choices

1533
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
that you could pick

1534
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
on the base skill

1535
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
got changed

1536
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
and made a lot better.

1537
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
We saw that, you know,

1538
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
a lot of the output of Flurry

1539
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
was related to doing

1540
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
the mechanics

1541
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
that the enhancement

1542
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
and the advanced Flurry

1543
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
were requiring you to do

1544
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
like casting it

1545
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,000
a bunch of times in a row

1546
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
and stuff like that

1547
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
and we wanted to move

1548
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
some of that damage

1549
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
from those enhancements

1550
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
and things into the base skill.

1551
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,000
So the enhancement

1552
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
and the advanced Flurry

1553
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:41,000
are still going to be

1554
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
pretty potent

1555
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
but we lowered their damage

1556
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
and instead just

1557
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
used the base skill

1558
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,000
even more.

1559
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And what this is going to mean

1560
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,000
is really just that

1561
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
you're going to be

1562
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
more consistently

1563
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,000
doing that damage

1564
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
and you're going to be

1565
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
less reliant on doing

1566
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
the stacking mechanics

1567
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,000
to get it.

1568
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Next, Wind Force.

1569
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You know,

1570
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
this one has had

1571
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
a troubled history

1572
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
of just trying to find ways

1573
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
to make it really good

1574
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and useful.

1575
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Instead of knocking back enemies

1576
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
when it procs,

1577
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
it's going to knock them down now

1578
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
so you no longer

1579
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,000
have to worry about

1580
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
knocking enemies

1581
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
out of your CC

1582
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
or you want them

1583
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
to be grouped up next to you

1584
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
and then you're just

1585
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
knocking one of them

1586
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,000
or a few of them away.

1587
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Now they're just going

1588
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
to go in place.

1589
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
We have a before and after here.

1590
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Again, a little preview

1591
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
of what we're doing

1592
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
with our uniques.

1593
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,000
But yeah,

1594
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Wind Force,

1595
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
you can see some of the things

1596
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
here as a preview

1597
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,000
is going to give you

1598
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
move speed baseline

1599
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
which is pretty interesting

1600
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
as a stat on a bow.

1601
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
You've got chance

1602
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
for double projectiles

1603
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,000
for your barrage.

1604
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You've got a couple

1605
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
passive upgrades there

1606
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
and then as you can see

1607
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,000
the damage went up

1608
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
but also now

1609
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
it knocks down enemies

1610
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
instead of knocks them back.

1611
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Last but not least,

1612
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
the Necromancer.

1613
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,000
We've been hearing

1614
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
a lot of feedback

1615
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
that blood Necromancer players

1616
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
are a little sad.

1617
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,000
They just aren't really

1618
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
catching up to the other

1619
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
versions of Necromancer

1620
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
so we've buffed up

1621
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
a bunch of their

1622
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
tempering recipes

1623
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
and the damage on them.

1624
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
We're also buffing

1625
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
their legendary paragon nodes.

1626
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Here's some here

1627
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
that we did.

1628
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Bloodbath,

1629
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
this one just makes

1630
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
your overpower damage go up.

1631
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,000
It's being doubled

1632
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
from 35% to 70%

1633
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
so that's pretty meaty.

1634
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Blood begets blood.

1635
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
That damage bonus

1636
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
when you're picking up

1637
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
blood orbs

1638
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
is being doubled

1639
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
and the maximum amount

1640
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,000
is being doubled

1641
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
so you're getting more

1642
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
per stack

1643
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
and you need less stacks

1644
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,000
to get to your max damage.

1645
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So pretty good there.

1646
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
And then last but not least here,

1647
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Lucky Hit.

1648
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
We've heard a lot of feedback

1649
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
from Necromancer players

1650
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
that they kind of rely a lot

1651
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
on the Miasma corpse explosion

1652
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
to get their Lucky Hit procs off

1653
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and that their other skills

1654
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
don't really compete

1655
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
and so they can't really

1656
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
have fun with Lucky Hit

1657
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
based builds

1658
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
more generally.

1659
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
So we just buffed Lucky Hit

1660
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
on a bunch of different skills

1661
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
so you can see there

1662
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
what all the numbers are.

1663
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Again, those will be

1664
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:34,000
on the patch notes

1665
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
but really they're just

1666
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
going to be Lucky Hit

1667
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,000
more often

1668
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
and getting cool procs more.

1669
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
All right.

1670
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:40,000
So next,

1671
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
let's talk about Uniques

1672
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,000
a little bit, right?

1673
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
We've got a lot to cover.

1674
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Yeah, so as we promised

1675
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
in the PTR stream,

1676
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
we said that we have

1677
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
this kind of different philosophy

1678
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
when it comes to Uniques

1679
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
and we went into detail there

1680
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and we updated our Uniques

1681
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
coming into Season 5

1682
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
but we didn't update

1683
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
all of our existing Uniques

1684
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,000
in the game yet.

1685
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So we've done that pass now.

1686
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,000
We've updated nearly

1687
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
every Unique in the game

1688
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
and I'm going to do

1689
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
a little bit of a recap

1690
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
of kind of how we thought

1691
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and then giving you

1692
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
some examples of what we did.

1693
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:08,000
So these updates

1694
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
are fairly dramatic.

1695
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
They're going to be

1696
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
showing you three

1697
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,000
from each class

1698
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
as well as three generic ones

1699
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
to give you a really

1700
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
meaty idea

1701
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
of the different categories

1702
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
and ways that we thought

1703
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:17,000
of updating Uniques

1704
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
and kind of, you know,

1705
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
what you can expect

1706
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
for your builds.

1707
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Yeah, and I know

1708
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
and Marcus is going to remind us

1709
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
about this at the end as well

1710
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,000
but like I know.

1711
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
You'll be hearing it a lot.

1712
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,000
But I will say

1713
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
we are showing three here

1714
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
for every class

1715
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
and three generic ones

1716
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
but every single Unique

1717
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
is actually

1718
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
in the patch notes

1719
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
and we have a before

1720
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
and after in the patch notes

1721
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
so you guys will have

1722
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
easy access and

1723
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,000
you can see.

1724
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
You can easily compare the two

1725
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
and see what was the difference.

1726
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
So after the stream

1727
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
you'll be able to compare

1728
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
and so we're just only

1729
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
covering a small amount here.

1730
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
We'll see everything.

1731
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Just a little sample serving.

1732
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
The patch notes

1733
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
are absolutely massive

1734
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
so you'll have a lot too.

1735
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,000
That'll be pretty cool to see.

1736
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Lots of snack on there.

1737
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
So yeah,

1738
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
so one of the things

1739
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
is your general power level

1740
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
of Unique Effects is up

1741
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and by Unique Effects

1742
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I want to be clear

1743
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
that is like the thing

1744
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
at the bottom

1745
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
that is like your,

1746
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,000
you know,

1747
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
deals 40 to 60%

1748
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
more multiplicative damage

1749
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,000
or whatever.

1750
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
That number is going to be

1751
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
up on the higher end.

1752
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So instead of 40 to 60

1753
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
it'll be 40 to 80

1754
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
or 40 to 90

1755
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
or 40 to whatever, right?

1756
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So that power level

1757
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,000
is just going to be

1758
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
generally up

1759
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
almost across the board.

1760
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And then really

1761
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
what we targeted

1762
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,000
for these updates

1763
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
is the stats

1764
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
on the Uniques.

1765
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
So the stats

1766
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
are going to pretty much

1767
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
break every rule

1768
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
that we had in the game

1769
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
before when it comes

1770
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
to being a cool item.

1771
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
So some things

1772
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,000
that you're going to see

1773
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
and I think I got an example

1774
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
of most of,

1775
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
if not all of these.

1776
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
But you're going to see

1777
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Uniques that have

1778
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
different inherents

1779
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
compared to other stats.

1780
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
So, you know,

1781
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
your boot inherent,

1782
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,000
you know,

1783
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,000
could be something

1784
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
that's not even related

1785
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
to boots or movement anymore.

1786
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It could be something else.

1787
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Or sometimes we add

1788
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
more inherent stats.

1789
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
So something that

1790
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
didn't exist before,

1791
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,000
you know,

1792
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
some items can have

1793
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
two inherents

1794
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
instead of just one,

1795
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
which is a pretty big difference.

1796
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
We have a lot more

1797
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
that have stats

1798
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
that break normal slot rules.

1799
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So, you know,

1800
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,000
things like movement speed

1801
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
on bows

1802
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
or cooldown reduction

1803
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:01,000
on weapons,

1804
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
stuff like that.

1805
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Uniques also can now

1806
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
have tempering affixes, right?

1807
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
None of them really did this

1808
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
in Season 4,

1809
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
but now that tempering

1810
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
is in the game

1811
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
and Uniques have to compete

1812
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
with these really great

1813
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,000
tempered items,

1814
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Uniques can have that too.

1815
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
They can also have

1816
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
much higher potential

1817
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
stat values

1818
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
compared to normal items.

1819
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,000
So, you know,

1820
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
if a normal item

1821
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
has 20 to 40% more damage,

1822
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
a Unique can be like,

1823
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:21,000
you know,

1824
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
1 to 300% more damage

1825
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
or whatever, right?

1826
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And we even do this

1827
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
with the tempered affixes.

1828
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
So, Unique can have

1829
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
juiced up versions

1830
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
of tempered affixes

1831
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
that make them solve

1832
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
those problems much quicker.

1833
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Also, we've introduced

1834
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
a lot of stats

1835
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
that really have

1836
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
powerful effects on them.

1837
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Sometimes even a single

1838
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
stat on a Unique

1839
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
can have the impact

1840
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
that a legendary power

1841
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
normally would on an item

1842
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
as far as what it does

1843
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,000
to a build.

1844
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And we'll have a couple

1845
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
examples of that

1846
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
where like a stat

1847
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,000
on an item

1848
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
is actually giving you

1849
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
a new effect

1850
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
that didn't exist before

1851
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
that you could do.

1852
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Damn, that's awesome.

1853
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah, so again,

1854
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
we're going to be going

1855
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
through three examples

1856
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
per class

1857
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
and three generics

1858
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
and I'm going to just

1859
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
try and quickly go through

1860
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and kind of point out

1861
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
some of the key things

1862
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
that are kind of neat

1863
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:03,000
about the items.

1864
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So, we're going to

1865
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
shotgun this a little bit

1866
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
and yeah, you're going

1867
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
to see some cool items.

1868
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So, let's get to it.

1869
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Woo!

1870
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Yeah, so first,

1871
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Penitent Greaves.

1872
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
This is a generic unique

1873
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
you can see here.

1874
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
This one now has

1875
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
two inherents

1876
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
as opposed to one.

1877
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Another thing

1878
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
that you can notice

1879
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,000
is that normally,

1880
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:19,000
you know, the inherent,

1881
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
the evaded grants

1882
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
more move speed

1883
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
is only for one second

1884
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
and this one is not only

1885
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
has two inherents

1886
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
but it's for two seconds.

1887
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So, you'll evade

1888
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
and like, you know,

1889
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
boost around that crazy

1890
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,000
sonic speed

1891
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
for a couple seconds

1892
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
which is pretty neat.

1893
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
And now you can run

1894
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
through enemies

1895
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
while you do it.

1896
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
We've also got

1897
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
some neat stats there

1898
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
like crit chance

1899
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
against chilled enemies

1900
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
and chilled potency

1901
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
there that are new

1902
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,000
to the game.

1903
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Here, Fists of Fate.

1904
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:41,000
This one a lot of people

1905
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
saw a little bit early

1906
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
and they were

1907
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
very happy about.

1908
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
So, one thing I think

1909
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
that's kind of cool

1910
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
is that with our uniques

1911
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
we're really trying

1912
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
to like double

1913
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:50,000
and triple down

1914
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
on the fantasy

1915
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:51,000
of the item.

1916
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,000
So, you know,

1917
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
something's about cold

1918
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
or something here

1919
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,000
like Fists of Fate

1920
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
is about like RNG

1921
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
to the max.

1922
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
So, we're really going

1923
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
hard on like

1924
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
what the theme is.

1925
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,000
So, here you can see

1926
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
like your attack speed

1927
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
can go from 0.1

1928
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
to 0.7

1929
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
and everything on it

1930
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
is like has a huge range

1931
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
of what you can roll.

1932
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So, like a greater affixed

1933
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Fists of Fate

1934
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
could be like a best

1935
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
in slot item

1936
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,000
for a lot of builds.

1937
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
The lucky hit chance

1938
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,000
on this.

1939
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Yes, this is the one

1940
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
that people point out

1941
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
that we...

1942
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It's just crazy.

1943
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I talked with one

1944
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,000
of the people

1945
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
on our team.

1946
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I want to shout out

1947
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Alex on our team

1948
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:20,000
who did a lot

1949
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
of this work

1950
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
and we had a choice

1951
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,000
here and we're like

1952
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
are we going to go crazy

1953
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
or go conservative?

1954
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I was like,

1955
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
you know,

1956
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,000
let's just go crazy.

1957
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Like, this might be insane.

1958
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It might actually be

1959
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:29,000
best in slot

1960
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
and break stuff

1961
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
but it's really cool.

1962
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So, yeah,

1963
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,000
greater affix

1964
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Fists of Fate

1965
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
there is going

1966
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,000
to be really cool.

1967
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Next, the grandfather.

1968
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Mythic unique example here.

1969
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,000
You know,

1970
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
a lot of people

1971
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:39,000
had issues

1972
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
with the ignored

1973
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
durability loss.

1974
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:41,000
You know,

1975
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
where you would like

1976
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
masterwork hit that

1977
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,000
or something

1978
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,000
and then you're

1979
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
not getting anything.

1980
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
We just moved that

1981
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,000
into be a,

1982
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
you know,

1983
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
a baseline inherent affix now

1984
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,000
so you don't have

1985
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
to worry about that

1986
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and then replaced it

1987
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,000
with something useful

1988
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
with a max resource.

1989
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And I will note

1990
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
like even in season four

1991
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
because that durability

1992
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
loss was kind of,

1993
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
was actually a hidden

1994
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
stat item.

1995
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Sometimes when you found

1996
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
a greater affixed version

1997
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,000
of a grandfather.

1998
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1999
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
It would actually apply

2000
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,000
to that.

2001
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
That is now

2002
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
donezo.

2003
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
It's just

2004
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
inheritance can't be greater

2005
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
which is something

2006
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
that we thought of

2007
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,000
a lot with this.

2008
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah, so now let's go

2009
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,000
into the classes.

2010
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Barbarian.

2011
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
This is Battle Trance.

2012
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
This one exists

2013
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
already on live.

2014
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Probably the two

2015
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
big things here.

2016
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,000
One is, you know,

2017
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
you have two different

2018
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
passives now that you get.

2019
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
A lot of times

2020
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
we're adding skill ranks

2021
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
to passives

2022
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,000
because that's a way

2023
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
to add multiplicative damage

2024
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
or just buffs

2025
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
to really cool effects

2026
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
on a unique

2027
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
via their stats.

2028
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
The other thing

2029
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
to point out here

2030
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
is the actual effect

2031
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
before it was giving you

2032
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
increased attack speed

2033
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
to all of your other skills

2034
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
when you had frenzy stacks.

2035
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Now you're going to be

2036
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
getting damage

2037
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
and attack speed.

2038
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
You know, we heard

2039
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,000
a lot of feedback

2040
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
from players that

2041
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
they would hit attack speed cap

2042
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,000
and then this unique

2043
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
wasn't really doing

2044
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
very much for them.

2045
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,000
So now you're also

2046
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
just going to get damage

2047
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
in addition to making it

2048
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
easier to hit that cap

2049
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
for your other skills.

2050
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So it's just, you know,

2051
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
more stats, stronger.

2052
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Next, Reign of the Ravenous.

2053
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
A couple things here.

2054
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,000
One is it's giving you

2055
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
skill ranks of rend

2056
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
which is pretty significant.

2057
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And remember,

2058
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
that 2 to 3

2059
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
might not seem so significant

2060
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
but when you greater affix that

2061
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
and then masterwork it,

2062
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
like your potential

2063
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
of more damage on this

2064
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
goes up very significantly.

2065
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
We're also giving you

2066
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:15,000
skill ranks

2067
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
to brawling skills still.

2068
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
The thing to point out here

2069
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
is your rend's duration,

2070
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
this will also just increase

2071
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
the throughput damage of it

2072
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
has been doubled

2073
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
so that's just more damage

2074
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,000
on rend

2075
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
in addition to the skill ranks.

2076
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And then also

2077
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
at the bottom,

2078
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
a small little detail

2079
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
but before,

2080
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
you could only

2081
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
apply that special effect

2082
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
of your brawling skills

2083
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
applying your rend's bleed

2084
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
every 4 seconds

2085
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
and now it's every second.

2086
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
So now if you're able

2087
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
to spam brawling skills,

2088
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
you're just going to be

2089
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
applying rend bleeds

2090
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
to enemies

2091
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
and stronger rend bleeds

2092
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
like crazy.

2093
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
So it's a pretty big

2094
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
power boost.

2095
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Next, the fields of crimson.

2096
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
The thing that we want

2097
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
to call out here,

2098
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I mean there's a lot of things

2099
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,000
that are kind of

2100
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
unique and different

2101
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
but is that

2102
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
one kind of rule

2103
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
that we had

2104
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
with item stats

2105
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
that we're now changing

2106
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:57,000
and breaking

2107
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
is we never really

2108
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,000
buffed things

2109
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
like enhancements

2110
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
or like the AB,

2111
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
like the different

2112
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,000
choice upgrades

2113
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
that you could do

2114
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,000
for a skill.

2115
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
This one actually buffs

2116
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
enhanced ruptures

2117
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
explosion size.

2118
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So you know,

2119
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
normally when you

2120
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,000
rupture an enemy

2121
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
it does that explosion.

2122
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
This will make that

2123
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
explosion be way bigger.

2124
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
So it's kind of

2125
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
a neat way

2126
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,000
that we can manipulate

2127
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
player power via stats.

2128
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Next, let's move on

2129
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
to the sorceress.

2130
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So the staff

2131
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
of endless rage,

2132
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,000
we actually have

2133
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
a combo here

2134
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,000
that we're going to

2135
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
show a little video of

2136
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
before and after

2137
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,000
with this.

2138
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Fireball builds.

2139
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
The staff now does

2140
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
some and the gloves

2141
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
would be doing

2142
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,000
some unique things

2143
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
to fireballs.

2144
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
One is butt plus

2145
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
fireball projectile speed.

2146
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,000
So this is actually

2147
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
going to make your

2148
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
fireballs fly through

2149
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,000
the air faster

2150
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
or bounce quicker

2151
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
and so you'll be able

2152
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
to get through them

2153
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
and they'll finish

2154
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
their path faster.

2155
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
You've got the

2156
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
tempering recipe now

2157
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
so it doesn't compete

2158
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,000
with your chance

2159
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
to cast twice

2160
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and you can see there

2161
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
it goes up to 75%

2162
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
just on that one stat.

2163
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,000
So it basically

2164
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
almost solves it for you

2165
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
by itself

2166
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
which is pretty huge.

2167
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You've got some

2168
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
massive skill ranks

2169
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
to fireball

2170
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
so now again

2171
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
way more multiplicative

2172
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
damage than before

2173
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
and then you know

2174
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
you can see at the bottom

2175
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
that the upper end

2176
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:03,000
of that damage

2177
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
is going up

2178
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
the same as most

2179
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
of our uniques.

2180
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And next

2181
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
it's combos

2182
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
with the gloves

2183
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
of the illuminator.

2184
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,000
A couple things

2185
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
to kind of

2186
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
gloat on here

2187
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,000
is the fireball

2188
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
attack speed

2189
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
is going up

2190
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
by a much bigger

2191
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,000
amount than other

2192
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
classes

2193
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
or than normal

2194
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
attack speed

2195
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
sorry on other slots.

2196
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Also you get mana

2197
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
when fireball explodes.

2198
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I played with

2199
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
this build

2200
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:25,000
and I think

2201
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
it was season 1

2202
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
and I constantly

2203
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
ran into mana issues

2204
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,000
because you always

2205
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
want to spam this

2206
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
as much as you can.

2207
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So when you think

2208
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
of this stat

2209
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,000
you know

2210
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
you can greater this

2211
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
you can masterwork this

2212
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
and you kind of

2213
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
combine this

2214
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
with the attack speed

2215
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,000
here

2216
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and then you combine

2217
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
it with the projectile speed.

2218
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Yeah and you get

2219
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
a lot more fireballs

2220
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:43,000
and remember

2221
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
it's every time

2222
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
that it explodes

2223
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
which when it bounces

2224
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
it's exploding

2225
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
and when you're

2226
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
splitting and getting

2227
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
more from multiple

2228
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:50,000
projectiles

2229
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
you're getting

2230
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
more bounce explosions

2231
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
so it's giving you

2232
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
a resource engine

2233
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
all in its own

2234
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
essentially a fireball

2235
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,000
machine gun

2236
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
which is pretty great.

2237
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So we've got a little

2238
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
bit of a season 4

2239
01:16:59,000 --> 01:16:59,000
to season 5

2240
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
comparison here

2241
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
of what it looks like

2242
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
a little video

2243
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
so in season 4

2244
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,000
you can see

2245
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,000
you know

2246
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
every third cast

2247
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
gives you 3

2248
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
but season 5

2249
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,000
you're going to

2250
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
randomly get 3

2251
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and then sometimes

2252
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
even more

2253
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
when it combines

2254
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,000
with the double

2255
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
projectile bonus

2256
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
so you can actually

2257
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
really fill up

2258
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,000
your screen

2259
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
with fireballs

2260
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
everywhere

2261
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,000
and every one

2262
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
of those bounces

2263
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:18,000
is giving you

2264
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
mana back

2265
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
to cast more

2266
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
that's ludicrous

2267
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
so it's pretty cool

2268
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
it's its own

2269
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
little engine

2270
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
next we've got

2271
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
blue rose

2272
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
probably the cool

2273
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
thing to point out

2274
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
here is

2275
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
there's a chance

2276
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
for ice spikes

2277
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
to explode twice

2278
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
so this is also

2279
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
something that we

2280
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
haven't really done

2281
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:35,000
where we have these

2282
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
we call them

2283
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
sub powers internally

2284
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
but you know

2285
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,000
these things like

2286
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
dust doubles

2287
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
or ice spikes

2288
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,000
that are like

2289
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
powers that generate

2290
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
when you cast a skill

2291
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,000
that are usually

2292
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
through legendaries

2293
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,000
or uniques

2294
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
we generally don't

2295
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
manipulate them

2296
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
too heavily

2297
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,000
like this

2298
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,000
but we're going

2299
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
to be experimenting

2300
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
more with that

2301
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
in unique

2302
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
stat affixes

2303
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
so here you know

2304
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
your ice spikes

2305
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,000
can actually

2306
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
like double proc

2307
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,000
so they get

2308
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
you know

2309
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:55,000
double explosions

2310
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
and then any other

2311
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,000
things that would

2312
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
proc off that

2313
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
would be doubled

2314
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
which is pretty neat

2315
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
next let's move

2316
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
on to the druid

2317
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
so waxing gibbous

2318
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
this is the

2319
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
shred druid unique

2320
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
so what we did

2321
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
here that I want

2322
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
to point out

2323
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:11,000
you know

2324
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
in addition to the fact

2325
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,000
that you're getting

2326
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
a bunch of skill ranks

2327
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,000
to shred

2328
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
and toxics cause

2329
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
which is a bunch

2330
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
more multiplicative damage

2331
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
so power level

2332
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
is going up significantly

2333
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
is blood howl

2334
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
grants stealth

2335
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
for a few seconds

2336
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
so what's really

2337
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,000
cool about this

2338
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,000
is you know

2339
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
we basically added

2340
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
a new mechanic

2341
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
via a simple item

2342
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
stat in this unique

2343
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
and it combines

2344
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
with the unique effect

2345
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:29,000
right

2346
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
so before on live

2347
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,000
you know

2348
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
you kill enemies

2349
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,000
with shred

2350
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
you go into stealth

2351
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:33,000
and then you come out

2352
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
and you guarantee

2353
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,000
crit

2354
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
so as you're

2355
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,000
killing enemies

2356
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
over and over

2357
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,000
you're just

2358
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
critting constantly

2359
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
as you go in

2360
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and out of stealth

2361
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
but you couldn't

2362
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:39,000
really do that

2363
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
against bosses

2364
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,000
you had no other

2365
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
ways to get

2366
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,000
into stealth

2367
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
but now we've

2368
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
created an alternative

2369
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
way where if you

2370
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
cast blood howl

2371
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
or get the blood howl

2372
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
effect in other ways

2373
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
you'll go into stealth

2374
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and get this proc

2375
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
and now you can get

2376
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
this you know

2377
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
against single bosses

2378
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,000
or in situations

2379
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
you couldn't before

2380
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
so we've given you

2381
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,000
a potential way

2382
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
to create your own

2383
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:56,000
engine

2384
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
which is pretty neat

2385
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:57,000
to get those

2386
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
infinite crits

2387
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
next great staff

2388
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,000
of the crone

2389
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I believe we showed

2390
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
this one earlier

2391
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,000
to people

2392
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
but I just wanted

2393
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,000
to point out

2394
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
what was special

2395
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
about this

2396
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
storm strike

2397
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
chaining to additional

2398
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,000
targets

2399
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
you know

2400
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,000
things like this

2401
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
again it's a single

2402
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
stat that does

2403
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
something that

2404
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:12,000
kind of really

2405
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
changes how the

2406
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:13,000
unique works

2407
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
right

2408
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
you're going to

2409
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:15,000
get all the

2410
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
different procs

2411
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and different

2412
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
effects by chaining

2413
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:17,000
to more enemies

2414
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
more often

2415
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
you can also see

2416
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,000
here that the

2417
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
upper end of that

2418
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
damage that you

2419
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
could get is going

2420
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
up from 150%

2421
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
to 200 so it's

2422
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,000
just better

2423
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
and last but not

2424
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
least we got

2425
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
storm's companion

2426
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,000
this one I again

2427
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
wanted to highlight

2428
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
another new thing

2429
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,000
that we're doing

2430
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
and I want to call

2431
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
it here is

2432
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
the lucky hit chance

2433
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
for the pack leader

2434
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
spirit boon

2435
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
so normally we never

2436
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
really manipulate

2437
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
class mechanics

2438
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
but here you

2439
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
know this pack

2440
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
leader this isn't

2441
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,000
like a passive

2442
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
or thing in the

2443
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,000
skill tree this

2444
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
isn't the spirit

2445
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,000
boon your class

2446
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
mechanic and this

2447
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
increases that lucky

2448
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,000
hit chance to get a

2449
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
reset on the

2450
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
cooldowns of all

2451
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
your companion

2452
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
skills so again

2453
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
this is something

2454
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,000
that you know

2455
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
normally we don't

2456
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
get to manipulate

2457
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
and now you'll be

2458
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
able to do and I

2459
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,000
think it'll be

2460
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
pretty cool

2461
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,000
we have also

2462
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
decided that pack

2463
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
leader is two

2464
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
words instead of

2465
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,000
one

2466
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
yeah everything's

2467
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,000
getting updated

2468
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
yeah everything

2469
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
everything's

2470
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:07,000
everything's

2471
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
changing

2472
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
all right moving

2473
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
on to the rogue

2474
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
eagle horn

2475
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
let me see what

2476
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,000
did I want to I

2477
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
think just pointing

2478
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
out here this was

2479
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
about moving the

2480
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
the tempered recipe

2481
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
the penetrating shot

2482
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
projectiles can cast

2483
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
twice again another

2484
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
example of that

2485
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
and we're also giving

2486
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,000
you a bunch of

2487
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
skill ranks to

2488
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
penetrating shot

2489
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
again this is a way

2490
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,000
that we're adding

2491
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
just like raw power

2492
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
and damage in ways

2493
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
that aren't in the

2494
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
unique effect

2495
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
so these stats on

2496
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
these things can be

2497
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
very strong out the

2498
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
gate and then again

2499
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:36,000
tempering and

2500
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
master working just

2501
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
makes these go go

2502
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,000
really really high

2503
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
next word of a con

2504
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,000
this one was a

2505
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
really silly fun one

2506
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,000
that we liked

2507
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
you see there the

2508
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,000
one I want to point

2509
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
out well one is the

2510
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
ultimate damage

2511
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:49,000
actually ultimate

2512
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
skill damage for the

2513
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
rogue is kind of a

2514
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,000
premium because they

2515
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
have that paragon

2516
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
node that makes it

2517
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
turn into multiplicative

2518
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
damage for all your

2519
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
skills so that's

2520
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
actually pretty meaty

2521
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
it's also way higher

2522
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
value than normal

2523
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
also the chance for

2524
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
rain of arrows waves

2525
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,000
to cast twice

2526
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
so normally we

2527
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
don't do you know

2528
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
chance to double

2529
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
cast on ultimates

2530
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
but again uniques

2531
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
get to break the

2532
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
rules so now you've

2533
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:11,000
got you know

2534
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
juiced up rain of

2535
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
arrows cooldown

2536
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
reduction they can

2537
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
cast twice and they

2538
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
hit way harder on

2539
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,000
the rain of arrows

2540
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
themed unique so

2541
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
again really trying

2542
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
to bring out the

2543
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
theme and the

2544
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
fantasy of these

2545
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
uniques in the

2546
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
stats in the effects

2547
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
to really create

2548
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
something special

2549
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
and next saboteur

2550
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
signet I was running

2551
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
this in season four

2552
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I'm a little sad that

2553
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I'm going to be doing

2554
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
something else in season

2555
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
five but I loved my

2556
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,000
stun grenade build

2557
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
but here you can see

2558
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
a bunch of grenade

2559
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
damage obvious theme

2560
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,000
for the grenade build

2561
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
we're also giving you

2562
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,000
a lot of your stun

2563
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
grenade size here

2564
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
and then again a new

2565
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
affix that kind of

2566
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,000
creates your own

2567
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
engine you're getting

2568
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
plus one energy when

2569
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
a stun grenade

2570
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
explodes and this is

2571
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
each individual grenade

2572
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
right so usually

2573
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
release a cluster of

2574
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
these things so now

2575
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
again I spent a lot

2576
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
of my time in season

2577
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
four trying to solve

2578
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
resource and get ways

2579
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
to to cast this a lot

2580
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
to throw out the stun

2581
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
grenades and now this

2582
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
kind of helps its own

2583
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
engine also one thing

2584
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
to point out here is

2585
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
that it's no longer

2586
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
just a flurry unique

2587
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
it's casting a core

2588
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
skill throws sling

2589
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,000
grenades so it's a

2590
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
lot more generically

2591
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
applicable you can use

2592
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,000
this with you know all

2593
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
the different core

2594
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
skills not just flurry

2595
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
next necromancer the

2596
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,000
big one I wanted to

2597
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
point out here we're

2598
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
going to be showing

2599
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:20,000
both of the blood

2600
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
surge uniques and

2601
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,000
how they've been

2602
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
updated and they

2603
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,000
combo with each other

2604
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
we have a stat here

2605
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
that blood surge

2606
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
drains more times from

2607
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
elites so to be clear

2608
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
this is the drain not

2609
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
the explosion but the

2610
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
drain does feed into

2611
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
the explosion damage

2612
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,000
and there's a lot of

2613
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
like synergy and

2614
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
things based on

2615
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
draining enemies so

2616
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
now you know one of

2617
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
the problems that

2618
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:39,000
blood surge has always

2619
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
had is when you're

2620
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
fighting a single

2621
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
target or a boss you

2622
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
know you only drain

2623
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
one enemy and then

2624
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,000
you're not getting

2625
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
your like explosion

2626
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
damage up but now

2627
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:47,000
you're going to be

2628
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
draining multiple

2629
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
times from those

2630
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
elites so you're

2631
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
getting you know more

2632
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
life back and other

2633
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
procs when you drain

2634
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
but also your explosion

2635
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
will be more significant

2636
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
now against them

2637
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
next death speakers

2638
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
pendant this is the

2639
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,000
other blood surge

2640
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
unique we also added

2641
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
another thing that

2642
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,000
combines with the

2643
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
other unique where

2644
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
you're getting essence

2645
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
per enemy drained

2646
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
right and so now as

2647
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
you drain enemies for

2648
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
the explosion you're

2649
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:09,000
going to be getting

2650
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
more essence back to

2651
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
cast the skill and

2652
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
spam it more we're

2653
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,000
also giving you a

2654
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
bunch of ranks to

2655
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
blood surge which you

2656
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
know just makes sense

2657
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
so you know 50% you

2658
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
know before master

2659
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
working and tempering

2660
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
multiplicative damage is

2661
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
already a giant buff to

2662
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
this but then also you

2663
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
can see that you know

2664
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
the numbers also went up

2665
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
on this as well so it's

2666
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
just going to be going to

2667
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
be pretty significant

2668
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
can't wait and last but

2669
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
not least uh greaves of

2670
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
the empty tomb this is

2671
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
your sever unique lots of

2672
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
stuff to point out here

2673
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
one is you have multiple

2674
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
inherents so you know

2675
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
normally you can only get

2676
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
three max of eight

2677
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
charges you get more

2678
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
here we also had a fun

2679
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
little thing where your

2680
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
evade now leaves behind

2681
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
desecrated ground because

2682
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:48,000
this is the desecrated

2683
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
ground unique we also

2684
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
have chance for sever

2685
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
projectiles to cast twice

2686
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
we have sever size here

2687
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
we also give you ranks to

2688
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
reaper's pursuit so this is

2689
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,000
really about just like

2690
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
moving and grooving like

2691
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
going around one thing i

2692
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
want to point out here as

2693
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
well is this new aspect of

2694
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
creeping mist that came in

2695
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
and you can combine this

2696
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,000
with the greaves of the

2697
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
empty tomb so this new

2698
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
aspect um you know we

2699
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,000
heard that necro players

2700
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
want mobility and boy did

2701
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
we give you mobility so

2702
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
what this does is when you

2703
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
evade during first of all

2704
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,000
you get evade cooldown

2705
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
reduction so you evade more

2706
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
but when you evade during

2707
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
blood mist you travel twice

2708
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
as far and both when you

2709
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
enter and exit blood mist it

2710
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
resets your evade cooldown

2711
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
and one of the things that

2712
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
makes this crazy where we

2713
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
might actually be crazy and

2714
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
i hope we don't have to

2715
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
revisit this but we're going

2716
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
to see is that that reset

2717
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
of your evade cooldown counts

2718
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
for all of your charges of

2719
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
evade so what this means is

2720
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
and we have a video is that

2721
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
you can evade five times

2722
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
then evade in blood mist and

2723
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
then evade five more times

2724
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
so see here then you're

2725
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
evading in blood mist and

2726
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
you're leaving behind that

2727
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
desecrated ground everywhere

2728
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
skating around you know

2729
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
yeah it's like an ice skating

2730
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
so every time you cast blood

2731
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
mist you're going to be

2732
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
getting 10 evades it's silly

2733
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
and hilarious but we're

2734
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
putting it in the game and

2735
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
i hope we don't regret it

2736
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
necros are going to be

2737
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
zooming yeah they're going

2738
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
to be zooming with this so

2739
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
wow yeah so that's kind of

2740
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
our preview of our uniques

2741
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
and kind of what's coming

2742
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
into the game again we're

2743
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
pretty excited about it i

2744
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
think it's gonna be pretty

2745
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
cool yeah but yeah

2746
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
professor adam jackson take

2747
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
a bow that is that is

2748
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
incredible and again that's

2749
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
not even everything there's a

2750
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
lot of stuff at that level

2751
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
patch notes after the

2752
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000

2754
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000

2755
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000

2773
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000

burning ether and we did this

rewards that they want to

confused in chat uh this is a

2842
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
question from dartless who was

2843
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
saying we can temper uniques now

2844
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
did i mishear that maybe that was a

2845
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
mistake being said so adam if you

2846
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
want to speak to us yeah 100%

2847
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
clear cannot temper uniques we want

2848
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
them to be different in that they do

2849
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
not engage with that system at least

2850
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
for now um but no you're going to

2851
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
be what we what i wanted to say or

2852
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
be clarifying is that you can get

2853
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
tempering affixes on uniques like

2854
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
they'll just drop with those affixes

2855
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
or whatever but you can't like go to

2856
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
the to the blacks with them manipulate

2857
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
them in that way you can't temper

2858
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
them gotcha cool cool thanks for

2859
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
clarifying that

2860
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000

2870
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
eternal realm feature that's going to

2871
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
appear in the game forevermore and so

2872
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
this is just the first version of it i

2873
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
mean you think back to what helltide

2874
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
was in the base game and how we've

2875
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
iterated on that over time to get it to

2876
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
where it is we're going to continue

2877
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
investing similar levels of effort into

2878
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
the infernal hordes too and so boons and

2879
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
banes is something we heard a lot about

2880
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
uh feedback during the ptr and so we

2881
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
absolutely want to make more

2882
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
improvements to the the boons and

2883
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
banes and so stay tuned um that's not

2884
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
going to hit in season five uh but we'll

2885
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
we'll figure out where we can get it in

2886
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
in future seasons awesome great to hear

2887
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
that we're going to continue uh tinkering

2888
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
on that feature in the in the seasons to

2889
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
come uh i've got a really interesting

2890
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
question from mano underscore imp with

2891
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
regards to those mano imp we know mano

2892
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
with regards to the damage increase per

2893
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
class resource sure they're asking is the

2894
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
spirit boring getting one percent damage at

2895
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
seven points if it's their main stat uh

2896
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
just because they have a lower amount of

2897
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
weapons yeah uh tbd tbd i don't want to

2898
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
go into math on spirit born yet but uh

2899
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
they'll be getting similar treatment to

2900
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
all the other stuff all this is kind of

2901
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
evergreen so awesome awesome uh lukey we

2902
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
lukey when will we see the overhaul of

2903
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
the paragon system uh would you consider

2904
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,000
removing the paragon limit uh there are

2905
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
going to be changes to paragon but we uh

2906
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
aren't talking about uh those changes

2907
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
yeah awesome yeah awesome tbd tbd tbd

2908
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
stay tuned uh love this name chicken wing

2909
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
929 love uh can the reputation rewards for

2910
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
season season of the infernal hordes be

2911
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
earned on only one character or all your

2912
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
seasonal characters um i believe it's uh

2913
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
uh all characters similar to like what we

2914
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
have for season four uh so you can

2915
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
actually go back in and just play like

2916
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
hey go through the reputation board and

2917
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
then uh get another resplendent spark

2918
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
that's really the question really that's

2919
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
truly the question yes you can you can

2920
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
get yeah yeah nice

2921
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,000
um systematic 5k adam jackson will our

2922
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
existing uniques be updated with these

2923
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
new unique changes yeah we we get this

2924
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
every round that we update them it's the

2925
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
same rules as always which is the unique

2926
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
power when we update that is your your

2927
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
existing uniques will get that right so

2928
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
when we increase your damage range or

2929
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
whatever that's going to get but the

2930
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
stats those are going to be legacy on

2931
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
any items that exist so you're going to

2932
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
have to reform your unique to get the

2933
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
new stats that are on them and now

2934
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
that's kind of the way that they're

2935
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
going to work going forward yeah say

2936
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
otherwise yeah it's it's it's just how

2937
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
things work under the hood yeah from

2938
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
when when we do changes on them so yeah

2939
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
nice

2940
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,000
um pudge pudge underscore bp are there

2941
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
any plans for clan rework slash

2942
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:40,000
improvements

2943
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
um there are i know there are some uh

2944
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
changes coming for uh some social

2945
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
features we're just not ready to talk

2946
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
about them now but but you'll you guys

2947
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
will hear about them soon awesome awesome

2948
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
uh this one's kind of a design

2949
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
philosophy question for adam jackson

2950
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
sure evans423 wants to know how

2951
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
future-proof is the system of static

2952
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
uniques when adding new slash better

2953
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
tempering effects and new content how

2954
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
future-proof are static uniques when

2955
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,000
adding new tempers um let me think

2956
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
semi right because like i think it is

2957
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
something where if we add like new

2958
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
tempers or new affixes or whatever we

2959
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
will probably need to go back and update

2960
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
uniques that that we wanted to apply

2961
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
to and make it you know work again

2962
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
um our hope is that these uniques are

2963
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
going to be pretty like future-proof

2964
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
and that they're going to be very

2965
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
meaty in the amount of power that they

2966
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
give you um they're also extremely

2967
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
thematic but i think we do reserve the

2968
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
right like if we find a new idea for

2969
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
uh existing passive or existing

2970
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
tempering that that is introduced to

2971
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
the game and we want to put it on we

2972
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
can do that i will say also one thing

2973
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
that we want to do more is like just

2974
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
come up with really crazy new ones that

2975
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
aren't even really tempering recipes

2976
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
but just like crazy effects right like

2977
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
blood howl grant stealth or you drain

2978
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
more with your you know blood search

2979
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
stuff like that so i would expect we'll

2980
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
probably be updating them as we go

2981
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
forward not probably as dramatically as

2982
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
this all at once but i i foresee this

2983
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
probably likely yeah nice yeah always

2984
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
tinkering always updating uh yeah

2985
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
speaking of which about tempering one

2986
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
thing that we forgot to mention and i

2987
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
know we mentioned it the ptr stream last

2988
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
time i'm sorry my earpiece just keeps

2989
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
falling off uh it's like i'm like

2990
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
scratching my ear but i'm not uh the uh

2991
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
greater af i know there was a lot of

2992
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
like feedback after season four

2993
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
regarding um uh tempering and

2994
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
potentially bricking items and one

2995
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
update that we talked about during the

2996
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
ptr stream and i want to mention it

2997
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
wasn't in ptr but is in uh season five

2998
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
specifically is uh greater affixes will

2999
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
actually get additional temporary

3000
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
rolls on them based on the greater

3001
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
affix you know quality of of what they

3002
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
are so uh for for um like like greater

3003
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
affix one star ones you'll end up getting

3004
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
one additional temporary roll um and

3005
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
then it grows by how many stars that

3006
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
there are so that is going in season

3007
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
five so and i we mentioned it last

3008
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
stream i just wanted to reiterate it

3009
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
because i actually forgot we should have

3010
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
mentioned it yeah great great to mention

3011
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
that adam that's awesome uh we've got a

3012
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
uh easy one here from z weapons uh what is a

3013
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
mythic unique there was a purple item

3014
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
yeah you can tune into our last stream

3015
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
for it but yeah um basically what was

3016
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
uber uniques is what people call them

3017
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
um it's basically like you know the

3018
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
really best items in the game that have

3019
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
like perfect stats and everything we

3020
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
rebranded them to mythic uniques they

3021
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
now have their own special color special

3022
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
beam when they drop they just got a

3023
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
whole treatment to really make them

3024
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
feel like the the penultimate items

3025
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
that that's super juicy yeah yeah

3026
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,000
that's awesome uh sophie0257 uh are

3027
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
they going to make it so that we can

3028
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
pre-download the update or will it be

3029
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
available only on the sixth that's a

3030
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
great question that's a good based off

3031
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
uh feedback from season four's launch

3032
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
the patch will be available to download

3033
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
roughly an hour before season of the

3034
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
infernal hordes launches so that season

3035
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
goes live at 10 a.m and roughly an hour

3036
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
before you'll be able to pre-download the

3037
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
patch to get into the game and get ready

3038
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
for the season yeah i know a lot of

3039
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
people are probably going like why not

3040
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
multiple days and things like that we're

3041
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
getting there we're trying but now it's

3042
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
it's it's uh we we got a lot of feedback

3043
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
about you know how things started

3044
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
immediately on the like you could

3045
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
download and actually start the season

3046
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
of course we want to make sure that

3047

01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
the the time for the season begin which is

3053
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
roughly like 10 a.m pacific on on the day of uh

3054
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
you you can just jump in without needing

3055
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,000
to download so yeah yeah uh skull mtv hey

3056
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
great job thanks uh any plans to rework

3057
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
master working in brackets higher cost but

3058
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
you know you can choose upgrades and

3059
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
tempering to make these systems have less

3060
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
rng um nothing to announce at this time

3061
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
we definitely have heard the feedback we

3062
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
are starting with the first step of like

3063
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
you know one of the things that we know

3064
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
feels really bad for players like i got a

3065
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
uh how do i say the more greater

3066
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
affixes you have on an item the higher

3067
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
stress and investment you have to like

3068
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
make it work the way that you want so we

3069
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
are relaxing that make it a little bit

3070
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
easier um another thing that we're

3071
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
thinking about that's a little lighter is

3072
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
like the tempering recipes making them

3073
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
have like three on average instead of

3074
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
four or more um something that we're

3075
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
talking about moving towards but nothing

3076
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
like of overhauling the system and doing

3077
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
a major change at this time that we have

3078
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000

01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
of stuff that that affects a lot more so on

3105
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
the gameplay but i'm not exactly sure if

01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
there's a ton coming yeah so we can

3107
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000

3114
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
items i guess in terms of like a rework or

3115
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
changing their functionality in any way

3116
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
yeah i'd say nothing to announce today for

3117
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
that yeah cool nice

3118
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:24,000
all right uh checking through mac and d's

3119
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
uh can we expect skill trees or support

3120
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
gems to change the way skills work

3121
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
can we expect skill trees or support

3122
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
gems to change the way the skill works i

3123
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
mean we're not doing any skill tree

3124
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
overhaul right now in season five um i do

3125
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
think we have talked a bit on the team

3126
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
about having the desire of the the

3127
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
upgrades for skills being like more

3128
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
impactful and really impactful um nothing

3129
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
to announce today but it is something that

3130
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
is on our radar and i think is cool i think

3131
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
one example that that we talk about a lot

3132
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
on the team is like the kick upgrade for

3133
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
the barbarian where normally you know when

3134
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
we originally designing kick it was this

3135
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
idea that you have this like skill where

3136
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
you hit an enemy and you care about the

3137
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
geometry of the place around you and you

3138
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
want to hit them into the wall and then

3139
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
they get knocked down take a bunch of

3140
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
damage and all this stuff

3141
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
um that part hasn't really played i think as

3142
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
well because the pace of our game is so

3143
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
fast but one of the upgrades for kick um

3144
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
especially i remember in the early beta like

3145
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
way before maybe it was alpha even um kick you

3146
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
know it converts kick from this cooldown based

3147
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
geometry skill into just a powerhouse where it

3148
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
just spends all your resource and does a buttload of damage to an

3149
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
enemy um and it was like one-shotting world

3150
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:36,000
bosses and stuff back then like it was it was hilarious i think i remember that but the the the skill still has that upgrade but i reference that upgrade a lot a lot

3151
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
because i think it's really cool when you can convert a skill to like used to be

3152
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,000
cooldown and now isn't or used to be about this utility and now it's just damage or

3153
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:50,000
vice versa where it like really changes what a skill does um we think it's really cool it

3154
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,000
definitely would be a lot of work to like do that to every skill but i think it's

3155
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
something that's worth talking about and pursuing so it is on our radar of

3156
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
something to do but nothing to announce today for it awesome that's really cool

3157
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
thanks adam yeah uh and that brings us to the end of our q a so i want to give a
