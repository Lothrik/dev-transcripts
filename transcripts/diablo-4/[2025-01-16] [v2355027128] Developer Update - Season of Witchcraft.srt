45
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Thank you.

46
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Thank you.

47
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Thank you.

48
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Thank you.

49
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Thank you.

50
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Thank you.

51
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:29,000


52
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Thank you.

53
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Thank you.

54
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Thank you.

55
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Thank you.

56
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Thank you.

57
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Thank you.

58
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah.

59
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Thank you.

60
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Thank you.

61
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Thank you.

62
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Thank you.

63
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,000


64
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
or part of a bargain. The tree is all about keeping your word and now that

65
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
bargain is broken so yeah the tree is mad. Full stop. Now the witches have

66
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
summoned you to the tree and they're offering you a deal. If you can get

67
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
those heads back for them they'll offer you the secrets of witchcraft. So that's

68
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
where we begin and the first thing we're gonna have an all-new quest line and

69
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
that new quest line is going to be you unraveling the mystery of those missing

70
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
heads. And while you're doing that like I said you're gonna be earning wild

71
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
witchcraft and occult gems. We have a new activity called head hunts and that's

72
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
gonna allow you to pursue whispers, slay head rotten, which is the new enemies, the

73
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
new family of enemies that we have this season, and find those missing heads. In

74
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
addition to the head hunts you're also gonna have root holds. These are new

75
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
micro dungeons that allow you to discover bonus head rotten and also their bosses.

76
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And then finally we've got some updates to the season journey that we'll cover

77
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
including a new pet named Dorian which is a pet raven. This is our first flying pet

78
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
so we're pretty excited about that. Let's talk about some of the powers. So

79
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
witchcraft, at least as we're defining it this season, it allows its practitioners to

80
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
call upon the power of the swamp to do their bidding. And there are three schools

81
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
of magic within witchcraft. We've got eldritch witchcraft and that's uncanny

82
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
magic that you know is just weird and bizarre and very of the swamp. You've got

83
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
psyche powers, these are powers of the mind and spirit, and we've got growth and decay. And that's magic that both

84
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
heals and harms your enemies. I'm gonna take a look at some of these in action.

85
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So first up we're gonna have eldritch powers once we get our clip going.

86
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And right here we're seeing that we've got fire bats which is a classic power from the witch doctor that we brought back this season paired up with doom orb.

87
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Next up we've got some psyche powers here and we're using vengeful spirit which is kind of hanging around you and zooming between enemies and the aura of lament where you see these psychic projections of hands come out of the ground and slow your enemies.

88
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And finally we've got growth and decay magic and you watch right there your wolves got really big all of a sudden. That's grow magic.

89
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And that's been paired up with the poison frog which you see in the corner wailing away on the head rotten there.

90
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So those are some good examples of the types of magic so that you're gonna be able to use in this season.

91
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And you'll start seeing them sprinkled all throughout the rest of the clips that we're about to show you.

92
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Next up let's talk about the head hunts.

93
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So I said before the tree was really mad right because it's missing its heads.

94
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And so what it's doing is actually calling out all new whispers and it's just furiously furiously searching for these heads.

95
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
But it can't do it on its own so when it calls out a particular zone because it knows roughly where the heads are.

96
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It calls its agents to help it out and you're one of the tree's agents so you can go and solve some of those whispers and get rewarded for them.

97
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Now the head hunts are special zone takeovers that compliment the hell tides.

98
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So folks on the PTR called them witch tides.

99
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Sure you can call them that but the idea is that these aren't just replacing hell tides.

100
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
They're there to supplement them in terms of what you can do in the overworld.

101
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Now these are going to be swarming with head rotten those enemies we talked about before.

102
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The head rotten are monsters that have fallen under the influence of the missing heads.

103
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And the heads have transformed them in really grotesque ways.

104
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Now these head hunts like I mentioned are going to feature all new whispers mixed with some examples.

105
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
These are the existing ones as well.

106
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Completing a whisper unlocks what's called an exposed root and that gives you a chance of actually triggering what is a cocoon.

107
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And these uprooted cocoons have a chance of then spawning a head rotten boss.

108
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So every time you complete a whisper you've got a chance at triggering a boss.

109
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And occasionally a boss will spawn from one of these and then everyone in the zone can work together to try and take down that boss.

110
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And if you're really lucky that boss will have one of the missing heads associated with it.

111
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So let's take a look at some of this in action here.

112
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Now first up we're going to check out one of our new whispers.

113
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
This is a shepherd whisper.

114
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
This is allowing you to you know guide some of these innocent wildlife in this area to safety.

115
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You know very simple but you know the witches want to make sure that no one's harmed by the head rotten.

116
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Next up we've got some villagers that are trapped in bramble in an entangled whisper.

117
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And so you're trying to defeat all the enemies around there in order to free the villager there.

118
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Following that we're actually going to get a view of one of the exposed roots as it transforms into this uprooted cocoon.

119
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And so much like some other open world boss fights there's going to be some combat leading up to the boss spawning.

120
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And that first cocoon actually didn't have a boss in it but you still got some rewards from it.

121
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So we're going to see if this second cocoon has a boss in it.

122
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So we're you know continuing to clear head rotten and indeed a boss does spawn.

123
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Now unfortunately it's not a boss with a missing head. This is a headless husk.

124
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But still it's going to be pretty rewarding to defeat this.

125
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So hopefully everyone in the area realizes that you know there's a boss in the air and they're going to come help you defeat this.

126
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And yeah that is a good peek at what head hunts are going to be.

127
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But let's go back to the tree now because I really want to take you through some of the steps on how to learn new witchcraft.

128
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So let's talk about that.

129
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So the first thing that's really important when you want to learn new witchcraft is that you're always going to be earning Covenant's favor from completing whispers.

130
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And that's going to unlock new witchcraft at certain tiers of the the Covenant favor board.

131
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Now additionally as you're killing those head rotten that I showed you before you're going to be earning Restless Rot.

132
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Now Restless Rot is something that you can offer as proof of a kill to the altar to earn that new witchcraft.

133
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And then you can use it also to upgrade your witchcraft directly in your UI.

134
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:38,000
One final note I want to make here is that we decided to use witchcraft and the seasonal powers as a way to help boost your alts.

135
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So that means that whenever you upgrade and unlock a piece of witchcraft that's going to stay upgraded and locked for all your characters on your account for the rest of the season.

136
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So it's going to be a great leg up for you know trying new characters in the future.

137
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Well let's take a look at some of this in action.

138
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
All right.

139
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So here we are in the Tree of Whispers area and we're looking at the Covenant rep board.

140
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And we'll see right up here that on rank seven you actually unlock some more witchcraft.

141
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So we're going to go over to our altar now.

142
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Now at the altar we're going to take a look at a list of things that you haven't learned yet.

143
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And each of these costs Restless Rot to earn.

144
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And so you're going to learn Grow.

145
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And now Grow has appeared in your witchcraft inventory to the right.

146
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And you're also going to look at upgrading Abyssal Resonance.

147
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That was a bit of a mouthful.

148
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And we can upgrade it from rank three to four by just applying the Restless Rot directly.

149
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But head hunts aren't the only places that you're going to be able to find head rotten.

150
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Let's go.

151
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Actually no.

152
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I'm skipping ahead.

153
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Let's talk about Forgotten Altars first.

154
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
So there's a bit of a twist on earning some of your witchcraft.

155
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Not all the witchcraft that you can learn is actually known by the Witches of Howazar or the tree for that matter.

156
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Some of it has just been lost to the world.

157
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And so these take the form of lost powers that you can find on Forgotten Altars out in the Dungeons of Sanctuary.

158
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So as you're adventuring through your dungeons, you will find some lost powers that you can't get anywhere else.

159
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And so it should be pretty exciting to stumble across one of these.

160
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Can't remember if there's a clip or not here.

161
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So let's take a look.

162
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
There it is indeed.

163
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And so real quick, you know, going through a dungeon, you see a Forgotten Altar, you interact with it, and then a new power is unlocked.

164
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Now, the cool thing about these is that if you find more altars, you can upgrade your powers by doing this, but you can also upgrade them through spending a premium price of Restless Rot.

165
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So you've got a couple options for upgrading these once you're able to find them.

166
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Now we're going to talk about the root holds, I think.

167
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So root holds.

168
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Root holds are micro dungeons.

169
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And so these micro dungeons are home to some of the head rotten and the head rotten bosses and the missing heads.

170
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
They've gotten a little wise to what the tree's up to.

171
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So they're trying to hide underground.

172
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And so each of these contains a really concentrated population of head rotten and their rewards.

173
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And they require a new type of sigil called the whispering wood in order to access.

174
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And so these drop from whisper caches.

175
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So as you complete those whispers, you'll get more access to root holds, as well as silent chests, which actually are pretty common in the headhunt areas.

176
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So let's take a look at a root hold.

177
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
First off, we're going to open our inventory and in there is going to be a whispering wood.

178
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And we're just going to trigger that like we would any nightmare dungeon.

179
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And then we're going to teleport right into our root hold.

180
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And I can take you through a little bit of that.

181
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
All right. Now we're in the root hold and we're going to come upon a couple of interactions, actually four.

182
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
These are rites and ceremonies.

183
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
These are interactions that allow you to increase the challenge in the root hold in order to get more rewards.

184
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And if it reminds you a little bit of hell breaches, well, it is pretty similar.

185
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But unlike those, you can actually do multiple rites and ceremonies instead of just one.

186
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And when you take those on, then all the enemies and all the interactions afterwards have been impacted.

187
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And so we're going to fight through some of the head rotten here.

188
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Like I said, root holds are a pretty good spot to get a concentrated dose of them.

189
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And you also get a number of guaranteed roots that you can try and uproot as well, which is great.

190
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
We'll watch a little bit more of this and then we'll culminate with a boss.

191
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:56,000
One more battle first, but I'll say that each root hold is guaranteed to have a boss at the end, which is nice if you want to start really trying to grind to get your missing heads.

192
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Now let's take a look at the boss.

193
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Oh, well, this boss actually has a head.

194
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So that's pretty cool because a lot of them don't.

195
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So we're going to kill that boss and that boss is going to drop a missing head.

196
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And we're actually going to go take it back to the Tree of Whispers now.

197
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So taking it back to the Tree of Whispers, we're going to talk to a witch and we're going to be able in return for giving her this head, craft an occult gem.

198
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And this gem, I think we're going to craft as an elder sigil, and we're going to be able to slot that into one of our rings.

199
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So let's do that right now.

200
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Here we go.

201
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And the elder sigil is not only going to provide us some defense like you would get from your diamond or skull that you've slotted into a ring or a talent, not a talisman.

202
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah.

203
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But also it's going to give you some additional bonuses above and beyond that.

204
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
But I'm dancing around it.

205
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
What are occult gems?

206
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And so let's talk a little bit more about what occult gems are at this point.

207
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So occult gems are special socketables.

208
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And these socketables are going to really help you fine tune your build after you have kind of a good foundation of witchcraft.

209
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Now they're crafted like you saw using the missing heads return to the Tree of Whispers.

210
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
They can only be slotted in jewelry slots though, your talismans and your rings.

211
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And they only last for the season.

212
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Now when items transfer to the Eternal Realm, they disappear forever.

213
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And they build on top of your witchcraft powers.

214
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You know, they're going to provide item and skill bonuses for certain witchcraft combinations.

215
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So if you really like the Piranado, for example, you're going to be investing in Hex and Aura.

216
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And if you invest a lot in Hex and Aura, it probably is wise to try and find an occult gem that also builds on top of those things as well.

217
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And that'll really allow you to fully enhance your build while you're entering and then playing through the endgame.

218
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
All right.

219
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So we've talked a bit about occult gems.

220
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:24,000
While we were putting all this together for Season of Witchcraft, we also saw some really good opportunities to improve the quality of life of the Whisper Loop.

221
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So let's talk through a couple of those right now.

222
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
First off, we've updated the town area around the Tree of Whispers.

223
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Previously, it was kind of small.

224
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It was, you know, home to a number of outcasts.

225
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And that group of outcasts has grown this season.

226
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Not only do the witches make home there, but there's a couple of new people there that provide additional services.

227
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And we've also actually put an extra armory in there, too, so you can make use of that.

228
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Now, while you're out in head hunts, we've also added a new feature called the Raven of the Tree.

229
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And this allows you to basically make submissions to the Tree of Whispers, turn in your grim favor in order to be able to get a cache immediately on the spot instead of having to return to the, you know, the Tree of Whispers itself.

230
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And, you know, it's convenient, sure, but it also allows you to really stay in the moment if, for example, you know, a new boss is triggered or something like that from an uprooted cocoon.

231
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And you want to join in that, you go over to the Raven of the Tree, turn in your grim favor, and then get right back into the battle again.

232
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And finally, we've got some ancestral caches. These are a new type of cache that we've added that guarantees an ancestral item.

233
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And we wanted to make sure just that the Whisper loop had, you know, full range of items that it could drop.

234
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So we're pretty excited to be able to share all of these with you, as well as some new improvements to the Season Journey.

235
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So let's talk through those real quick. Now, with the Season Journey, we realized that a lot of casual players use the Season Journey as a way to figure out what to do next.

236
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And we also realized that our early chapters hadn't really been helping the casual players as much as we would have liked.

237
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So we've reworked a lot of those early objectives to help casual players more, because we want to see more of them get into the endgame.

238
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Now, the later chapters, though, didn't feel especially challenging to us. So we've tried to improve that.

239
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Chapter 7 especially, we've reworked to really provide some more aspirational goals for players.

240
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And this is something that we're just going to continue working on in future seasons as well.

241
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Now, we've asked you to do a lot more in terms of the objectives, so we wanted to make sure we gave you a really great reward, too.

242
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So this is where you can earn Dorian the Raven. And like I said at the top, this is our first flying pet, which is pretty awesome.

243
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So let's take a look. You know, I am pretty excited to get Dorian.

244
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I have a feeling that flying pets are pretty much going to be my new favorite moving forward.

245
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So, yeah, definitely looking forward to this one.

246
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, yeah. Dorian is going to be wonderful. You know, Ravens love shinies.

247
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So him picking up your gold is just perfect.

248
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Oh, yeah. Right on. Yeah. Green point.

249
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah.

250
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And finally, I think I'd like to chat through some PTR stuff.

251
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So Charles is going to cover a lot of the updates we made to the powers and occult gems, because that's what his team focused on.

252
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But the seasons team really focused on some of the head hunts and systems and took a lot of your feedback and really tried to improve the game prior to launch.

253
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So here's a couple of things that I just want to cover real quick.

254
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
First off, the multiplayer head hunts felt overwhelming for a lot of new players.

255
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And so we've done a number of things to tweak the head hunts to make sure that they don't feel as overwhelming.

256
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
First off, we've made some targeted reductions to the number of elites.

257
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
There were just a lot of elites on the PTR.

258
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And so you're still going to have a lot of monster density as you're fighting through these head hunts.

259
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:26,000
But hopefully this will make things a little more manageable because we also had to reduce the number of not the number of bosses, but the frequency at which they spawned.

260
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:34,000
We've got bad luck protection to make sure that, you know, you will eventually see a boss spawn as you're playing through a head hunt.

261
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But we had to dial that down just a little bit because they were coming up quite, quite often.

262
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
We've also reduced the number of low value item drops.

263
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You know, we had heard from a number of you that you were spending more time picking up a lot of items that really weren't good instead of actually battling the head rotten, which is what we want you to do.

264
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
We've also reduced the number of active head hunt zones from five to four.

265
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And then finally, we're going to add a new HUD element.

266
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:11,000
A number of folks have pointed out that it wasn't really clear that completing whispers was the thing that actually triggered the roots and then the cocoons.

267
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And so we've got a HUD element that will definitely illustrate that better.

268
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Unfortunately, that's not going to come to release 2.1.1, which is going to be roughly two weeks out from launch.

269
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Now, head rotten, especially bosses, were not challenging enough.

270
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So that's another thing that we've looked to address.

271
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
We've increased the head rotten barrier effect.

272
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Previously, it was around half health.

273
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
We've made that full health now.

274
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And we gave the head rotten a very small percentage of damage reduction as well.

275
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
We've given you a lot of cool new powers and form of witchcraft to play with.

276
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
We want to make sure the head rotten serve is a good challenge for you as you're building out your witchcraft powers.

277
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Next up, head rotten bosses were just not rewarding enough across the board.

278
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So we've increased their rewards to a level that's closer to a blood maiden than what they were previously.

279
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And then finally, some players didn't quite understand how to earn and upgrade witchcraft.

280
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So we made some changes to help with that.

281
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Each altar is going to contain the same inventory now instead of having unique inventories.

282
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And that way you don't need to try and figure out which altar you need to go to in order to learn something.

283
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And we've also rewritten a lot of the tooltip descriptions to make sure that we're very clear about where you can go to get things.

284
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
But yeah, I think that covers it for PTR learnings.

285
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And I'm trying to think if there's anything else, but I think I'll pass it back to Irvine.

286
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
No, I think you covered all of it, Dan.

287
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
That was incredible.

288
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
That was an absolute ton of content.

289
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
There's just so much to dive into with this season.

290
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I think I can speak for everyone between Rootholes, Witchcraft Powers, Occult Gems.

291
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
There's just so much in the mix to dive in and get used to.

292
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And it all kind of comes back to head hunts that you can kind of use as a zone to get into all the content, which is super exciting.

293
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So Dan, thanks so much for walking us through all of that.

294
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I know we've got more details coming out in our patch notes following the stream.

295
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And we do have some of those Witchcraft Powers already existing in our blog.

296
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So if you want more information on those, you can check those out.

297
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But Dan's going to stick around because we will be bringing Dan back for our Q&A section at the end of the stream.

298
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So if you have any questions on Dory and the Raven or on Witchcraft Powers, Occult Gems, or anything to do with Season of Witchcraft,

299
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
please drop those in chat and we'll grab them throughout the stream.

300
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But for all of you who are kind of theory crafting and build crafting and thinking about like,

301
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
okay, what's my play style going to be for Season of Witchcraft?

302
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You're probably already thinking about the different Occult Gems, the different Witchcraft Powers.

303
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
But to finish off that equation, of course, you need to get all the balance updates for this season.

304
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So Charles, can you take us through what's coming?

305
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Of course, yeah. I'd love to talk about how you're going to attack these head rotten.

306
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Like what is your build going to look like?

307
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And what are some of the new uniques and legendaries that you're going to get to play with in this season?

308
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
First, before we get into each individual class, I want to talk about some of our broader initiatives on the class design side

309
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
that kind of affect every class in some way.

310
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Specifically, I wanted to talk about how we did some ultimate skill updates in this patch.

311
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:20,000
For ultimate skills, we're able to get skill ranks on them starting in Season 6, the previous season.

312
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
But now once you get them up to rank 5, you're going to get a special bonus.

313
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And we found these to be really flashy and fun on the PTR.

314
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
People love playing with ultimates and you get to cast them more often.

315
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
They've got more effects.

316
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
They had some scaling ways to scale their damage with these rank 5 bonuses sometimes.

317
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
We did find that some of those exact scaling numbers were a little on the higher side.

318
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
They were a little bit more powerful and kind of crowding out non-ultimate builds.

319
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
We love that people are playing these and we want them to be powerful.

320
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
But there are certainly some times when it's a little too much and it feels like you can't play anything else.

321
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So we are taking a pass across the board on some of those ultimate Scalions to bring them down just a little bit.

322
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But we still expect them to be very powerful and very fun.

323
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Secondarily, we've got the Summons update.

324
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This was a big pass across summons from Necromancer, their skeletons, Druid companions.

325
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Rogue Shadow Clone is a big one.

326
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Oh yes.

327
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And then even Sorcerer Conjurations and the Barbarian Ancients even.

328
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So for the Summons update, without getting too technical into it, essentially what happened was all of the damage that your summons do is going to be attributed to the player.

329
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And not to a separate entity that's kind of separated from you.

330
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And what that ultimately means is that all of those summons will now inherit your damage bonuses more consistently.

331
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Anything that says you deal increased damage affects your summons.

332
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Just out of the box, it works for everything.

333
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It's just more consistent interaction across the board.

334
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Any of your lucky hit effects that says, hey, you've got a lucky hit chance to stun an enemy.

335
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
All of the damage from your summons also can trigger that now.

336
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And this is great for consistency across the board.

337
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Previously, it was sometimes inconsistent.

338
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
What would work with what.

339
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And I'm particularly excited about Shadow Clone, as we'll talk about in the Rogue section coming up.

340
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
But that was one that historically really never hit the mark for an ultimate skill.

341
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And with this new update, we think Shadow Clone is going to really live up to the promise of really duplicating your actions in a way that feels meaningful and does tons of damage,

342
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
exactly like you'd expect it to.

343
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Oh, it's going to be very powerful.

344
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I'm looking forward to it.

345
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
And summons truly are just an extension of you now.

346
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Right.

347
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
In all of your power.

348
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They're inheriting all of that properly and they're going to blast.

349
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It's going to be great.

350
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Absolutely.

351
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,000
The one last kind of big picture item that we took away from the PTR was about crowd control effects.

352
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
We noticed that there is a whole lot of what I call incidental crowd control effects.

353
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Things that happen from lucky hits or procs.

354
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Specifically from the Worldly Fortune tempering manual that gives you lucky hit chance to stun or chance to freeze an enemy.

355
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
As well as particularly from the Fist of Fate unique item.

356
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:14,000
We found that it was often the most common way to build your character in the late game was to really stack up these effects.

357
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And then you're just applying a lot of crowd control on this lucky hit cadence rather than actively pressing crowd control buttons or really opting into it.

358
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And we do think that once it gets to a certain point of that, it can make our combat less engaging.

359
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Where enemies just randomly get stunned or frozen without you really having too much input into that.

360
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:41,000
But then it also makes it very frustrating when you don't lucky hit and an enemy hits you that you expected to have got hit with this.

361
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,000
So we're looking to potentially address that in a future season or future updates.

362
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
We don't have any changes regarding the crowd control here in Season 7.

363
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But it's one of those examples of the learnings that we're going to take forward to future seasons and potentially look at improving this so that we can make our combat feel that much more engaging.

364
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And actually get a little bit of back and forth between you and the enemies a bit more than there currently is.

365
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Especially in the hyper late game situation when your characters are really maxed out.

366
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So with that in mind, let's get on to some of the individual classes starting with the Barbarian.

367
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So the Barbarian on the Season 7 PTR was performing quite solidly.

368
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
We were pretty happy with where Barbarian landed.

369
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
We are really excited about Hammer of the Ancients and this Earthquake build with the new unique which we'll show in a moment.

370
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
We do think the Hammer of the Ancients part of that maybe could use a little bit more numerical buffs.

371
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
So we threw some buffs there as well as to Whirlwind.

372
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
That build was definitely falling a bit behind some of the other builds.

373
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,000
But on the whole, we definitely expect Barbarian to be really powerful and a strong option going forward.

374
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Let's take a look at that new unique item, the Mantle of Mountains Fury.

375
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Oh yes.

376
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
This empowers your Hammer of the Ancients to cause a seismic line.

377
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And if that line hits an Earthquake, it's going to explode that Earthquake for massive damage and big fire explosions.

378
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Looks so sweet.

379
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's very intense.

380
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Very powerful and right on the Barbarian fantasy of just hitting things with big weapons, making earthquakes, making explosions.

381
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Yeah, that's ludicrous.

382
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I love it because the flavor of Hammer of the Ancients is like hit the ground and smash it.

383
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And this is just taking that and amplifying it by like a hundred times.

384
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Oh, absolutely.

385
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So really excited for this and to see how this build performs in Season of the Witchcraft.

386
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Up next, we've got the Sorceress.

387
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So the Sorceress, kind of in contrast to the Barbarian, was by far the weakest class on the PTR.

388
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
No getting around that.

389
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:47,000
We definitely made some adjustments going into this season that we think maybe overshot and brought Sorceress down a little further than we'd be happy with.

390
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Particularly changes to Conjuration and Burning bonuses.

391
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
We're happy with how that affected build variety, but the overall power level suffered.

392
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So with that in mind, we're going to do a lot of buffs on, mainly on the passive effects for the class, to really kind of bring all of their numbers up by just a little bit across the board.

393
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I specifically wanted to call out our changes to Searing Heat and Icefall.

394
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
These are legendary Paragon nodes that previously were very build specific.

395
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Like you would only use Searing Heat in a Burning build.

396
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
We've made some tweaks to it where it's still good in a Burning build.

397
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It's probably better, but it also has some applications across all builds and all damage types.

398
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:31,000
So these will just be a little bit more generically applicable, but still very good for the build that they were initially intended for.

399
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Right.

400
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
With that in mind, I want to show some of the updates to Firebolt enchantment.

401
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
This is one that we had reworked as part of those Burning changes, and we thought even on the PTR it wasn't quite hitting the mark.

402
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So now, dealing Burning damage, if you take this enchantment, will have a chance to heal you for some of your maximum life, which it already did.

403
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And it also unleashes a bonus Firebolt onto a nearby enemy.

404
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:02,000
So that you can see in this clip here, when enemies are burning, they're just randomly firing off some extra Firebolts to nearby enemies that can really help to spread that burning and take down big packs.

405
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Yeah, it's its own little chain Firebolt now.

406
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Exactly.

407
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah.

408
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Also, I wanted to highlight some of the new uniques coming in this season.

409
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So Sorceress has two. The Strike of Stormhorn is a unique focus that's going to modify your Ball Lightning to give you Super Ball Lightnings sometimes.

410
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So it'll always fire out straight forward and it's a little bit faster.

411
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And occasionally, you'll get the Super Ball Lightning, which will explode for a big chunk of damage at the end in a cone shape and also stun enemies.

412
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It's kind of like going bowling.

413
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Exactly. And you get a Strike of Stormhorn.

414
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Exactly.

415
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Alternatively, you could take the other unique focus that is being introduced in this season, Okun's Catalyst, to kind of play Ball Lightning the way it's often been played in the past, with this gravitational effect.

416
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:58,000
We've done some reworks on the gravitational aspect that previously did that, and now it will be in this unique, where the Ball Lightning will orbit around you and do damage to enemies who are close by.

417
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
You really want to get close and in that action, whereas with Strike of Stormhorn, you're playing at a little bit more of a range.

418
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Right.

419
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
We really like how we're doing these paired uniques, where you kind of have a choice.

420
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Hey, what focus do I want to use?

421
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
They are going to be mutually exclusive. You can't have both.

422
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
They're in the same slot.

423
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But that's because they're so different, and they're different play styles.

424
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:33,000
But we think putting these into different uniques gives us the space to really live up this fantasy, you know, give you lots of affixes and bonuses that make it as powerful and really to help enhance that fantasy that we're hoping to play.

425
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah, and Okun's Catalyst really gives you that, like, transformative Ball Lightning experience, which is like the orbiting Ball Lightning.

426
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:48,000
But Strike of Stormhorn kind of just amplifies the original Ball Lightning experience, which is just shoot it out and have it explode in this magnificent blast of energy.

427
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So I love that we are allowing both of those to shine.

428
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Absolutely.

429
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Alright, on to the next class. We've got the Druid.

430
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So the Druid on the PTR did have one bugged build.

431
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
One of their legendary Paragon nodes was causing their damage to scale way higher than we intended.

432
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Occasionally we'd even kind of break the game and go, you'd see negative damage numbers.

433
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Definitely not intended. We fixed that bug.

434
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But despite that, we think Druid on the whole was still in a solid place even without that.

435
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
We've made a number of adjustments and reworked the Blurred Beast aspect.

436
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
This is one that we had tried out a rework on the PTR and it wasn't quite hitting the mark.

437
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
It wasn't quite as engaging to play as we had hoped.

438
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So we did a re-rework to it to help improve the Shred builds for Werewolf.

439
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Additionally, I wanted to highlight some of the Spirit Boon updates.

440
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
These were the Druid class mechanic. You get these Spirit Boons.

441
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Historically they've been a little bit falling behind and we've done some big buffs here to make them really powerful.

442
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I especially like the Gift of the Stag. It's my favorite one.

443
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
It gives you passive Spirit generation every second.

444
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:03,000
That really helps smooth out Druids' early game in particular when they're struggling to really get their resource engine online.

445
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
They were definitely one of the slower classes early on.

446
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And I think this update to the Spirit Boons is going to really help that.

447
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah, totally. And that's just such a great example of how the update is going to help them

448
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
because Druids have typically struggled with generating Spirit in the early game.

449
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And so having more access to that is going to help a ton.

450
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Yeah.

451
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Let's take a look at a clip of the new Blurred Beast rework.

452
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So on the PTR it would do some bonus strikes based on how far you traveled.

453
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Now your Shred will just always have a chance to land additional strikes,

454
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
but it's going to roll that randomness four times.

455
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So if you get real lucky on your Shred, you're going to hit so many times on that target,

456
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
which really helps amplify the fantasy of werewolves striking fast, striking multiple times.

457
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Yeah, this aspect is super fun to play and I absolutely love what the art team did with this,

458
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,000
combining the mechanics of, you know, that feedback on the extra strikes with the actual additional slashes going out.

459
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
It looks awesome.

460
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
All right, on to the Rogue.

461
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
So the Rogue was a very strong class on the PTR.

462
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
We thought it was in a great spot, very powerful, particularly with Reign of Arrows.

463
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Yeah.

464
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Reign of Arrow builds were already a pretty common, pretty powerful build before the season,

465
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
but with the new changes to introduce the additional scaling damage on it, they were just absolutely top.

466
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah.

467
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
So I will say that, of course, as part of addressing the ultimate changes across the board,

468
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
we did bring down the scaling a little bit on Reign of Arrows,

469
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
but we do think that it's still going to be a very compelling choice.

470
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Rogue and ultimate skills are going to be just fine going forward into the season.

471
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Oh yeah, it'll be good.

472
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Also, I wanted to talk a little bit about Shadow Clone.

473
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I know I teased that earlier with the summons update.

474
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Shadow Clone was probably one of the biggest updates in this season

475
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
to really make sure it worked with all of your damage, all of your bonus effects,

476
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,000
all of your procs, and especially work with a lot of your legendary effects that modify your skills.

477
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
So previously, if you had, say, if you're using Flurry,

478
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and you had the aspect of encircling blades that would cause Flurry to hit all around you,

479
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
your Shadow Clone wouldn't know that you have that.

480
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It would just kind of attack like a normal Flurry.

481
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
With this update, it'll now copy all of your legendary effects,

482
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
just as if you were casting the skill yourself.

483
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It comes from the Shadow Clone, and it works with all of those modifications.

484
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Oh man, that's huge.

485
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Absolutely huge.

486
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It's a lot more damage.

487
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Yeah.

488
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yeah.

489
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I really think, you know, I love Reign of Arrows, I love Death Trap,

490
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
the other ultimate options on Rogue, but I think Shadow Clone, it's time to shine in this season.

491
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It is. Shadow Clone, hit the gym.

492
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Absolutely.

493
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Let's take a look at a clip of the new Shadow Clone in action.

494
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So here we've got the aspect of encircling blades, the Flurry that I mentioned earlier.

495
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Oh baby.

496
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Doing the big AoE around both you and the Shadow Clone.

497
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Additionally, with twisting blades, when they come back and orbit around you,

498
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
that Blade Dancer's aspect, they'll also come back and orbit around your Shadow Clone.

499
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Wonderful.

500
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Charles, you're going to make me do a Rogue Flurry Shadow Clone build this season.

501
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yeah, it should be great.

502
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Let me know how that works out.

503
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Alright, on to the Necromancer.

504
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:14,000
So the Necromancer was probably the class that benefited most from a bug with the scaling of the Ultimates.

505
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,000
As I mentioned, there was some scaling with different stats, and whenever there was two stats involved,

506
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
particularly on Army of the Dead, then it was actually increasing the damage far higher than we had intended.

507
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
So we have fixed that bug, and we've addressed it.

508
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
But, with that in mind, Necromancer is definitely the biggest benefit of the Summons update.

509
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I know Shadow Clone is great, but Necromancer is the Summons class.

510
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Of course.

511
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
So they have, by far, the most.

512
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,000
All of their Skeletons and their Golems are now going to much more consistently interact with your lucky hit procs,

513
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
your bonus damage effects.

514
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Anything that increases your damage output will also increase the damage output of your minions.

515
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And, on the whole, we really expect the Summon Necromancer to be at its peak going into this season.

516
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Amazing.

517
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So channeling my Adam Jackson here.

518
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Minion stonks high.

519
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Minion stonks are absolutely going up this season, for sure.

520
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Yeah.

521
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Additionally, we've got some new, just like the Sorcerer, we've got two uniques that talk to Blood Wave.

522
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
The unique, or the legendary, sorry, the ultimate skill.

523
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Right.

524
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
We've got two different unique pants that can enhance your Blood Wave in different ways.

525
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Let's take a look at a clip of those.

526
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
So first, we've got Indriel's Memory.

527
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And this is going to be kind of your standard Blood Wave.

528
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You know, it still flies forward.

529
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
But when it hits the end, it's going to trap enemies in a Bone Prison.

530
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Additionally, it modifies your Bone Spear to also become a Blood Skill.

531
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Now, you've got a Blood Spear.

532
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Right.

533
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And with the inherent affix here, casting your Bone Spear reduces Blood Wave's cooldown.

534
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
It really promotes the synergy between Blood and Bone.

535
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And you're going to get a nice loop of, hey, cast the Blood Wave and then trap them in that Bone Prison.

536
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Hey, that's perfect for lining up this Blood Spear.

537
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
And by casting that, you're going to reduce the cooldown in your Blood Wave to be ready for the next pack.

538
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Right. This unique alone really makes Blood and Bone, like a Blood and Bone build come alive, which is cool.

539
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Absolutely.

540
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
The alternative, you could use Kissimmee's Legacy.

541
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
This one changes Blood Wave.

542
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Instead of one wave going forward, you've got two crashing in from both sides.

543
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
And it's going to pull enemies towards you.

544
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
And when it hits, it's going to do a big pulse of damage in the middle.

545
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
That's awesome.

546
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It's so cool.

547
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It's very transformational in the way you think about it, the way you position it, and what your use case is.

548
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Right? It's not for pushing enemies away.

549
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
It's for bringing them in close and really wanting to be in the thick of combat there.

550
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yeah.

551
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
It really makes me think about a more melee or close range centered Necro build.

552
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Whereas, Indira's Memory makes me think about a ranged Necro build.

553
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Absolutely.

554
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
This pulls them in.

555
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Perfect for setting up a Blood Surge to hit enemies right around you.

556
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:12,000
So, definitely looking forward to see, you know, Blood Wave being played in a number of different ways in this new season.

557
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And finally, we've got the Spiritborn.

558
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Of course, our newest class.

559
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Which is very strong.

560
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It was very strong in the previous season or what's currently live on season 6.

561
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,000
We did some adjustments to some of the bug interactions that was causing their damage to scale way higher than intended.

562
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
As well as a handful of nerfs across the board going into the PTR.

563
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
That being said, on the PTR, we still found them to be a very strong class.

564
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Arguably, still the strongest.

565
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So, with that in mind, we didn't really make too many changes.

566
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
We really wanted to make sure that we brought some of the other classes up to that level.

567
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And we think that Spiritborn is in a good place.

568
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
So, there was actually a very minimal amount of numerical adjustments to Spiritborn going into this season.

569
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
With that in mind, I wanted to highlight the Razor Wings build.

570
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
There's a new unique item.

571
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
The Sunstained War Crozier.

572
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
As well as a new aspect.

573
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
The aspect of Endless Talons.

574
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
That's going to really help enhance this Razor Wing build.

575
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I think we've got a clip of that.

576
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So, we've got the Sunstained War Crozier.

577
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And that's going to enhance all of your focus skills.

578
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
They automatically benefit from all of our upgrades.

579
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
You don't need to invest skill points in there.

580
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And by casting it, you increase the damage of your potency skill, your Razor Wings, whenever you're casting focus skills.

581
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
As Razor Wings is a potency skill.

582
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Yes.

583
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Absolutely.

584
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Yeah.

585
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
So, we're really looking forward to seeing how this Razor Wings was maybe a little bit underrepresented on the current season.

586
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And we're really looking forward to this unique and the new legendary to really bring it up to par.

587
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
All right.

588
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
So, that covers our class updates.

589
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And once again, I kind of went at high level for each class.

590
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Because the actual number of changes were rather, you know, there's a lot more that we didn't want to just throw up all the numbers for every single class.

591
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So, I kind of painted a broad picture.

592
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Make sure you check out the patch notes for the actual changes that should be coming right after this stream.

593
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Yeah.

594
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
The patch notes are massive.

595
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
So, buckle up for those.

596
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
They're quite fun.

597
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
If we went through those, that would be like a four hour stream.

598
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Right.

599
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Yeah.

600
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But dive into those post stream.

601
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Absolutely.

602
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Luckily for some of the occult gems and witch power updates, we could fit kind of all the changes onto the slide.

603
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
So, we're going to go into a bit more numbers here.

604
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So, let's take a look at what we made updates on the occult gems.

605
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I think on the whole, occult gems were pretty strong.

606
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,000
They were really hitting that mark of they were appealing to put into your jewelry, the rings and the amulet.

607
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And they give you a lot of defense and a lot of other bonuses.

608
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Some of the bonuses, maybe a touch high.

609
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
So, we brought some of them down by just a little bit.

610
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Right.

611
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
We still think on the whole, these are going to be really exciting moments to be able to craft these once you get those heads.

612
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I really like to call out the update to witching hour here at the end.

613
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
This is a occult gem that modifies your core skill to gain the eldritch tag.

614
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And that enables some really interesting synergies that you'll be able to explore once you get your hands on the full witchcraft system.

615
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
But when it had a timer of five seconds in order to do this, it was really hard to build around.

616
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And now reducing that down to one second means you can much more consistently benefit from this effect.

617
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
And it really opens up the build possibilities with the witching hour occult gem.

618
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
It was a bit too slow paced for how fast Diablo 4 is right now.

619
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
But, you know, with one second on the timer, it should be a lot more playable.

620
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
For sure.

621
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
We've also made some updates to the witch powers themselves.

622
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And for the witch powers, we think in general these were probably a touch weaker than we'd like.

623
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So, across the board, there's some numerical improvements.

624
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Especially on the poison frog servant.

625
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
My favorite.

626
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
The little frog pet.

627
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
The wee beastie.

628
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Hell yeah.

629
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Oh man, he got big buff.

630
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Love that guy following us around and spitting the poison and exploding if he ever dies.

631
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Yep.

632
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
So yeah, on the whole, we think witch powers were pretty good.

633
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I love how flashy they are in particular.

634
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Oh yeah.

635
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And just how impactful they look and feel.

636
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Our team did a great job with all of these.

637
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Knocked it out of the park.

638
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Alright.

639
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
And with that in mind, there's also still one additional new witch power that we did not have on the PTR.

640
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Ooh.

641
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
We've got the force of will.

642
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Now this is a psyche witch power that empowers your overpowers.

643
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
When you kill an enemy, your next overpower is going to gain some increased damage up to a maximum.

644
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
And if you rank it up to at least rank four, it'll empower your next two overpowers.

645
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Excellent.

646
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
This was one that we were not able to get out on the PTR in time.

647
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It had some issues, but it was being in development.

648
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
But for the actual season launch, we're going to have this out there and available.

649
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
We know it kind of really rounds out the roster of witch powers that were available.

650
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yep.

651
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
We had, you know, one less psyche power than the others.

652
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
This is the last one.

653
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And we didn't really have too much support in there for overpower builds.

654
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And now we do.

655
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Voila.

656
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
So, really excited about this one and helped to empower overpower.

657
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Alright, so I think that wraps up all of our balance changes.

658
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Once again, check out the patch notes for the exact details.

659
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:07,000
But I hope this, you know, gets your minds turning for build crafting for next week when the season launches.

660
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah, there is absolutely a ton to chew on.

661
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Like, I went into the stream absolutely thinking I was going to roll Spiritborn again.

662
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And now I'm thinking I'm going to have to go Barb or Shadow Clone Rogue.

663
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Those are so sweet.

664
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Got my decisions cut out for me, that's for sure.

665
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Absolutely.

666
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And with the Armory, you're going to be able to pick, you know, one class and a bunch of builds from all of them.

667
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I mean, Aislinn, I think what better thing to get into now than tell us about the Armory.

668
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Oh, yeah. I would love to.

669
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Yeah.

670
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So, for those who don't know, the Armory is a tool that you can use to basically save a loadout that you've constructed.

671
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
So, you're going to be able to save your skills that you've picked.

672
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You're going to be able to save the equipment you've used.

673
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You're going to be able to save the Paragon points you've put in.

674
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
And you're going to be able to imprint it onto one of these slots in the Armory you see on the left here in this image.

675
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Like, this character has Crush Hand, Touch of Death or Touch Death, Quill, Razor Wings and Payback.

676
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
So, you know, this is a Spiritborn that has saved a bunch of different builds there.

677
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:14,000
It's really wonderful because, you know, if you want to try a different build, like if you want to try Touch of Death, but you've spent a really long time working on Crushing Hand,

678
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
you don't have to worry about changing all of that manually anymore with the Armory.

679
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
You can just do it automatically.

680
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Once you've created that build, you save it and then you can swap to it whenever you want.

681
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
These loadout slots are also character bound.

682
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So, you know, you make a Spiritborn and then you decide you later want to swap to a Necro or, you know, whatever.

683
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,000
You're going to be able to ensure that you have a lot of variety to play in each character class.

684
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Another thing about loadouts is that they don't cause gold to change.

685
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
So, you're not going to have a bunch of significant gold overhead when you're actually swapping these.

686
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
So, you don't have to worry about that at all, which is very nice.

687
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And the Armory can be accessed through a bunch of different places in Sanctuary as well, including major cities, the Dark Citadel, the Tree of Whispers, of course,

688
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:03,000
which is a major focal point of Season 7, and training areas so that if you're trying to test certain things,

689
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:09,000
you can really easily make adjustments without having to, you know, spend a lot of time on that.

690
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
And finally, we've got a few PTR updates where we gathered feedback from the PTR.

691
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
We have improved the button clarity from the PTR.

692
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:25,000
If you see in the image, the little highlighted white box section, that should be more clear than it was in the PTR.

693
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And we heard you guys about easier loadout deletion.

694
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
We're going to make sure that that is much easier to do in 2.11.

695
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And next up, we have some gameplay updates.

696
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So, these are just some miscellaneous things that are coming in Season 7 related to systemic gameplay.

697
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
So, I'll just go through these one by one here.

698
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
We have Paragon Migration.

699
01:16:49,000 --> 01:17:04,000
So, any experience that you earn on your Paragon levels in the Seasonal Realm, once the Season is over, are going to be added to your Eternal Realm Season, rather, your Eternal Realm Paragon level.

700
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:13,000
So, if you earn a bunch of Paragon XP in Season 6, and then Season 6 ends, all of that Paragon XP is going to be added to your Eternal Paragon level.

701
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Which is going to make reaching Paragon level 300 a lot more attainable for a lot of folks on the Eternal Realm, which is pretty cool.

702
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah, you just get progress every season over season on your Eternal Realm Paragon to make sure you can really reach the heights of that, even if you're just a seasonal player for the most part.

703
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
When you hop into Eternal Realm, all of that progress is going to be carried over.

704
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Yeah, and it's actually going to be really nice, because I think the way I like to think about it is, even if you don't play on the Eternal Realm, it's kind of like a window into how much you've played the game, and how much effort you've put in.

705
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And you get to look at that number and be like, oh, that just gets higher and higher. It's great.

706
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Next up, we have some unique power roll updates.

707
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:07,000
So, something that you might notice when you are finding unique items is that if they roll Ancestral and they drop with greater affixes, that doesn't affect the actual unique power roll itself in any way.

708
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:17,000
So, it was possible to find, for example, a three or four greater affix unique, but then the actual power roll itself min rolled.

709
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And that could feel pretty deflating.

710
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Oh, yeah.

711
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Because you would get really excited that you found a unique that you wanted that had like all the GAs, and then you look and it doesn't actually feel very usable because the power roll itself was very low.

712
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
We're changing this in Season 7.

713
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So, now the power roll floor changes based on the number of greater affixes that the unique has.

714
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:46,000
So, the more greater affixes it has, the higher guaranteed roll on the unique power you're going to get.

715
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So, when you do see that three or four greater affix unique you want, you know it's going to absolutely slap, which is awesome.

716
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Yeah, definitely.

717
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
That was always a little bit of a frustrating experience when you get really excited for an item drop,

718
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
but then you're like, well, is it really better than what I currently have?

719
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,000
You know, you had to stop and think about that based on the affixes and the unique power roll.

720
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
But now, if you get a three or four GA, hey, you know it's going to be powerful.

721
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
It may not be guaranteed to be the best one, but it's going to be, you know, one of the more powerful rolls.

722
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Yeah, absolutely.

723
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And next up, we have some other ancestral item changes.

724
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:33,000
So, something you may have noticed if you were playing a lot of season six is that ancestral items are the only ones that can have the top aspect rolls.

725
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:39,000
And what that meant was that those ancestral items were still rolling randomly.

726
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So, like, let's just say for the sake of argument that a non-ancestral item with an aspect could roll up to rank eight on that aspect.

727
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
But then the ancestral version could roll up to rank 11.

728
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:55,000
That ancestral item was still randomly, like totally randomly rolling among all the different ranks.

729
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And that made it seem really, really, really, or it didn't seem, it was.

730
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It was very rare to find the top end of these aspect rolls, which actually wasn't the case in previous seasons.

731
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And we were all feeling that in season six.

732
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And for the completionists out there and the people who want to make sure that they have the best version of the aspects that they can,

733
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
we wanted to make sure that we changed that.

734
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,000
So, now when you find these ancestral items, they are going to gravitate more towards the top end of those aspect rolls.

735
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And it should be much easier to actually fill out your collection of aspects than it was before in season six.

736
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And then as just a totally separate but wonderful thing, we were working on, like, how often ancestral items should actually drop as a baseline.

737
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And we've just bumped that up in season seven.

738
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,000
So, you should, in general, find more ancestral items than you did before.

739
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And this is, like, a very, something that feels very small but has a big impact on the season as a whole.

740
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So, that should feel a lot better in season seven as well.

741
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And finally, something else that we were noticing in season six was that people were finding tons and tons of gem fragments

742
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
and sometimes even capping out their gem fragments if you've played enough.

743
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And this problem was exacerbated in season six.

744
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And we want to make sure that you have something to do with those gem fragments.

745
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So, we created a gem fragment conversion at the Jewel Crafter.

746
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
So, we have a little clip to just show what that looks like here.

747
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So, we're in Zarbenzed as a sorcerer and we're next to the jeweler.

748
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
We're going to talk to them.

749
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
There's a little tab where you can go to Jewelry Crafting.

750
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And once you're in the late game and you've already crafted all your grand gems

751
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
and you don't actually have much to do with your gem fragments anymore,

752
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
now you can just directly convert them into jewelry.

753
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
So, you can craft rings and you can craft amulets

754
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
and it will give you a little cash that will have a randomly rolled item.

755
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,000
And this is just, again, you know, it's a nice dump, basically,

756
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,000
once you want to just, once you finish all your grand gems and you just want to find some extra gear.

757
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And these can roll as ancestral items, which is wonderful.

758
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:05,000
And amulets and rings can, you know, they have a wide range of potentially useful stats.

759
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And so, being able to just roll those more is really nice

760
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
because you can actually target farm the things you need.

761
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Absolutely. Yeah.

762
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Really excited for that.

763
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Yep, for sure.

764
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:20,000
And finally, we have some kind of more quality of life-centered or early game updates

765
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
that should be really nice going forward season over season.

766
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
So, now that we're in season seven of Diablo 4,

767
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
it's possible that you may have made a character of any given class

768
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
and you might be doing it again.

769
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And it's not always the most fun to go through the same content over and over.

770
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And so, because of that, we wanted to make sure that you didn't actually have to do your class quest

771
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:50,000
to unlock your class mechanic every single time you make a new character.

772
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So, for example, if you made a sorcerer and you unlocked enchantments previously,

773
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
you're not actually going to have to do that again.

774
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
So, when you hit level 15 on a new sorcerer in any realm,

775
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
you're immediately going to unlock an enchantment slot

776
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
because the game knows that you already did that before.

777
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,000
You can, however, still do the class quest if you would like, but you do not have to.

778
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And again, just to reiterate, you do have to do the class quest at least once on any character

779
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
and then on your account, it's unlocked forever.

780
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:28,000
And to go along with this change, we have a new cache that we like to call archetype cache,

781
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
or archetype caches rather.

782
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So, these are basically themed goodie bags.

783
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So, they come from a variety of sources.

784
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
You're going to get an archetype cache when you complete the class quest.

785
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,000
You're going to get them periodically over the course of the season journey from different chapters.

786
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And then eventually you're going to start earning greater archetype caches as well,

787
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
which have better stuff.

788
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
But we have a clip here to basically just show off what an archetype cache looks like

789
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
and what doing your class quest looks like in Season 7.

790
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So, we have a level 15 sorcerer here who's just going to go and do their class quest,

791
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
which is the legacy of the Magi over here.

792
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
And the reason that this character might want to do the class quest still,

793
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
even though let's assume that they have already made a sorcerer

794
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
and have already unlocked their enchantment, is because they're going to be getting an archetype cache.

795
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
So, we're going to go through, we're just going to do all of the stuff for the Legacy of the Magi,

796
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
get through the dungeon.

797
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
But then at the end, we're going to get an archetype cache.

798
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And archetype caches have items and a tempering manual that are relevant to a specific theme of any given class.

799
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And so, I'm glad we have sorcerer here because the sorcerer themes are very straightforward.

800
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
For example, pyromancy, or fire, is one of the themes in sorcerer.

801
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
So, here we see we have a pyromancy cache that we got from completing the class quest.

802
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
We're going to open it up.

803
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:56,000
It's got two legendary items, a tempering manual, and some extra materials like bundled herbs and angel breath, etc.

804
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Because it was a pyromancy cache, it came with a utility and a more offensive focused legendary

805
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
that are related to being a pyromancy sorcerer.

806
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It also came with a pyromancy related tempering manual.

807
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
So, that really helps you get started on your journey as like a fire sorcerer.

808
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
So, if you find something like that, you're right out of the gate level 15,

809
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,000
you're going to get a big jump in power and you're going to be able to dive into like what it means to be a fire sorcerer pretty quickly.

810
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Yeah, I think what I really like about this change is that, you know, if you're just playing a new character,

811
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:35,000
you're in the flow, you're doing the head hunts, you're leveling up, you ding, hit level 15, right?

812
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
You think, oh, now I've got to go do this quest, otherwise I'm missing out on power.

813
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
And sometimes, you know, you're in that flow.

814
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
You don't want to stop and change, shift gears and go do that class quest.

815
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
You now can do it on your own time, right?

816
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
You can instantly unlock that power from the class mechanic.

817
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And then, whenever you get a chance, whenever you think, hey, I want to go do this quest,

818
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:59,000
you can go do it and then feel rewarded for getting a nice archetype cache that really maybe pushes you in a certain direction

819
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
if you're unsure of how you want to build your character, can help to enhance, you know, the pyromancy, like you mentioned.

820
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Yep, or frost or lightning or, you know, every class has its own themes.

821
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
So, it's going to be fun to dig into that.

822
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Cool.

823
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Cool.

824
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
All right.

825
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
That's awesome.

826
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Yeah, I think even for that, like, early game too, like, when you're kind of scrounging for materials and uniques,

827
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
it is kind of difficult to, like, hit that next power level.

828
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,000
So, knowing that you have, like, a guaranteed, now optional quest to go to to get that power in.

829
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I can speak for Twitch that too.

830
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
They were very, very excited to see that you did not have to do the class quest anymore.

831
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Oh, yeah.

832
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Yes.

833
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
But that it gives you this optional, you know, power boost in a similar direction.

834
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Yeah. We wanted to make sure that it, like, wasn't worthless if you had already done it a lot.

835
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
We wanted to make sure that there was still something there to feel like it was a meaningful quest.

836
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Yeah, but not so good that you feel like you're missing out if you're...

837
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Exactly.

838
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Exactly.

839
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Taking care of things over in the headhunts and things like that.

840
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Yep.

841
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Well, that brings us to our Q&A portion of the stream.

842
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
So, we're going to bring Dan Tangway back and we're going to answer some of your hard-hitting questions.

843
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
So, thank you for everyone who have dropped questions in Twitch chat throughout the stream.

844
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I've also been laughing at your commentary throughout.

845
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It's been pretty good.

846
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,000
So, first off, I want to drop a question from Doggo asked,

847
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Will there be a mid-season patch with balance changes?

848
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Yeah, I can talk about that.

849
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
We are currently planning to have a mid-season balance patch like we do every season.

850
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I just want to reiterate some of the philosophy around mid-season patches as well.

851
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,000
For our mid-season patches, we're mainly looking at taking the data from when the season launches.

852
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:41,000
So, honestly, we haven't started looking at the mid-season patch at all because it's so heavily driven by what actually happens when the season launches.

853
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
What builds are performing well?

854
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
What builds are not performing well?

855
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:51,000
If there's anything that is bugged or broken to the point where, you know, it's trivializing the game, that might be something to look at.

856
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:08,000
In general, for mid-season patches that happen, well, in the middle of the season, we're primarily looking to bring up the underperformers or fix issues of interactions that maybe aren't quite seeing the spotlight that we were expecting them to.

857
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
We're not really looking to take the top builds and nerf them.

858
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Right.

859
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Because we know players have already had time to invest in their characters.

860
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
They've got the gear.

861
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
They've leveled it up.

862
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
They've, you know, read build guides like, hey, how do I make this character?

863
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And we feel like if we're taking those down in the middle of a season, that really does a disservice to players that, you know, you are afraid of making the powerful thing because it might get nerfed in the mid-season.

864
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
So that's something we avoid.

865
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:50,000
There are, of course, sometimes rare exceptions when they're so far above our power bar or they are literally breaking the game due to performance-related issues which occasionally pop up.

866
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Those things we still will address when we need to, but in general, mid-season patches are not for nerfing strong builds if they are just strong.

867
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:04,000
And that's partly why during Season 6 we knew that, you know, Spiritborn was a very powerful class.

868
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Like, no kidding around it.

869
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
It was definitely stronger than the other classes on Season 6.

870
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
But that was okay.

871
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
We didn't want to make any kind of snap judgment of like, oh, we need to nerf it here in mid-season.

872
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
We know players have been invested into it and we want to respect their time and investment into that.

873
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:27,000
It's important that there's a sense of security in picking a build and knowing that it is going to stay viable when you're playing it throughout the season.

874
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Yeah.

875
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:37,000
And kind of as a corollary to that, whenever we do seasonal updates like launch a brand new season, that is more when we're going to look and say, hey, what is dramatically overperforming?

876
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
What is crowding out the rest of the roster?

877
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Like Spiritborn during Season 6 was maybe crowding out some of the other classes.

878
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Yeah.

879
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
We take the seasonal resets as a time to say, that's when we're going to bring those builds down.

880
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And that's when everyone is starting fresh on the new season.

881
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
And so you're not losing that much of time investment if it's starting all fresh again.

882
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Yeah.

883
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:08,000
And on the system side, in terms of mid-season changes, it's really important to us that we have a very targeted approach to systemic changes in mid-season patches.

884
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:22,000
We want to make sure that we are gathering as much data as possible and as much information as we can to ensure that any tweaks we make aren't going to cause waves or changes that we weren't expecting or undesirable.

885
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:34,000
So we really want to gather as much like telemetry and data as possible from like how people are actually experiencing the season and then kind of patch those pain points that people, that we all find together.

886
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And we want to wait to make sure that we're doing it right.

887
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,000
So we really want to know how people are going to be playing Season of the Witchcraft.

888
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,000
And then we'll basically figure out what needs to happen and change from there.

889
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Yeah. And that's why so much of the feedback from PTR or even just throughout the regular seasons, all the feedback, we really do listen to it.

890
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And it's so important to us to make sure that we can make Diablo 4 as best as we possibly can.

891
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
It's really critical that we get that feedback and we're able to iterate on that.

892
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Absolutely.

893
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Awesome. That is a super thorough answer for mid-season patch.

894
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
For sure, yes.

895
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I mean like I'll take all the information you got, so that's fantastic.

896
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Yeah.

897
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
This one's probably for you Aislinn from Huluboy.

898
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Okay, bear with me here.

899
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Pap-sarup-sagan.

900
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Do the Class Quest caches scale to the level when they're opened?

901
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Oh, yes.

902
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
They absolutely do.

903
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
So you can get it early or you can get it later.

904
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:37,000
But the archetype caches that you find in the Class Quest aren't actually the only place you can find archetype caches.

905
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
You're going to be able to get more from the Season Journey and other sources as well.

906
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
So they're not exactly like a super finite supply.

907
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,000
So you don't have to think too hard about like exactly when you should be opening them.

908
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,000
The Class Quest is just one among many sources that you can earn in archetype cache.

909
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
So you don't have to like sit on it throughout the whole season to be like, alright, when am I going to pop this thing?

910
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Yeah.

911
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And nice to have some extra goodies as you're on your way to get Dorian the Raven.

912
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Of course.

913
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Because we know that's the most important thing.

914
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I mean, I don't want to say, Dorian's pretty cool.

915
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Also, on a similar thread, the Collector Casey asks,

916
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Is the Class Quest unlock retroactive as of right now or only after we complete it this season?

917
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Yeah, so as long, it's retroactive.

918
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:27,000
So as long as you've completed, you know, you've done the Sorcerer quest before on a Sorcerer at any point during Diablo, you're good to go.

919
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Nice.

920
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
From the Discord, Bacterial, cool name.

921
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Can we expect the summon tag to work with minion thorns?

922
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And any update on Bristleback aspect working with minions?

923
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I believe they should. I'd have to look into precisely minion thorns. I know that was a stat that, you know, your summons can inherit your thorns.

924
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
That was a stat that I...

925
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I'd have to look into exactly Bristleback aspect.

926
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:09,000
As a general matter, our philosophy on minion thorns and minions in general is if you think it should work, it should.

927
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
The interactions of when you deal thorns damage, it should...

928
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
If your minions are the ones triggering that thorns damage, it should count as if you had dealt it.

929
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Okay.

930
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I don't have that right in front of me, that particular interaction, but that is our philosophy.

931
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
And if that's not happening, then we'll look to address it and improve that moving forward.

932
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Cool.

933
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Thank you.

934
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I just had a question from...

935
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Aoe Alina.

936
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Are there plans to reduce visual clutter such as an opacity slider?

937
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I love Sorcerer and Spiritborn, but the visual effects are hindering my party.

938
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I think that would probably be something that we would have to talk to the UI team about and the folks over in VFX.

939
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:01,000
It's something that we've been grappling with throughout the life of Diablo because there's so much happening, especially when you have an end game build.

940
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:13,000
And if that gets so out of hand with new seasonal mechanics or new powers or legendary aspects that we create, it's something that we'll be taking a look at every time something like that comes up.

941
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I totally get it too, because when you're playing Spiritborn, you know what to look for as you're casting these abilities, but if you're just around it, then it can be a little overwhelming.

942
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Like, when I have friends that come by that perhaps haven't played a Diablo game before, they're like, how do you know what to look at?

943
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It's like, you just gotta figure it out.

944
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
But I can totally see how that could be a bit of a distraction on the screen.

945
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Do-do-do-do.

946
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Ooh, Anjinsan.

947
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:45,000
For the Q&A, how do hydras work with the new summoning changes and how does burning damage work in comparison to poison?

948
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Another very technical question for you, Charles.

949
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:53,000
So luckily, you know, I did include the sorcerer conjurations in the summons update when I talked about them.

950
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Yeah.

951
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
But actually, for the most part, the conjurations were already behaving this way.

952
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
And that was part of the inconsistency that I kind of had glossed over and said, hey, they were inconsistent.

953
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And, you know, since now we're in the more technical part, the inconsistency was that most of the sorcerer conjurations were already behaving the way that we wanted them to.

954
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Right.

955
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
The damage was being attributed to the player.

956
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:26,000
And it was actually the necro minions and shadow clone and druid companions primarily that were not as interactive as we would have liked.

957
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Right.

958
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
So with that in mind, there's actually no real functional changes to the way that hydra works with this.

959
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I don't believe hydra was really touched, but it was actually used as kind of the example of how we wanted to implement and make the other summons work.

960
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
One question I do want to take really quickly that I've seen throughout chat.

961
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I mean, it was really hard to ignore.

962
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
People are asking where Adam was.

963
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I mean, I think we just have to address it straight up.

964
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Adam Fletcher is no longer with Blizzard, which is really too bad.

965
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
So you won't really be seeing him in a whole lot of other streams.

966
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
So really sorry to disappoint chat, but you're stuck with him.

967
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Just kidding.

968
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
He's been here the whole time.

969
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Just kidding.

970
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
We're just kidding.

971
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Adam's staying forever.

972
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Is Adam in the room with us right now?

973
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
He hasn't been here the whole time.

974
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Yeah.

975
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Yeah.

976
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
To be clear, Adam has literally sat two feet to the left this entire time.

977
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Just like for the whole stream.

978
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Just hanging out, checking out, watching chat.

979
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
So yeah, Adam, Adam is here to stay.

980
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Do not worry.

981
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
All right.

982
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
All right.

983
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Da-da-da-da.

984
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I'll do that.

985
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
All right.

986
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Love from Judith.

987
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Stash space is already a problem for anyone running multiple characters.

988
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Are there any plans to change Armory loadouts so that they will not be stored in Stash?

989
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
You know, it's something, the Armory is very new.

990
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:54,000
We knew that the community really, really wanted the Armory, and so we wanted to get out a version of it that was serviceable to get started.

991
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
But we know it's a really, really important topic for the community.

992
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:05,000
So it's something that we're going to continuously look at, and we're going to be looking a lot of feedback on the Armory to make sure that it's as smooth as possible all the time.

993
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And to that end, you know, we will be taking that into consideration.

994
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
No concrete plans right now, but it's something, you know, it's one of the topics that we have.

995
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:23,000
And our, again, our ultimate goal is to make the Armory just basically the most streamlined version of itself that it can be.

996
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
So look for Armory improvements in the future for sure.

997
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Awesome. Cool.

998
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And we got our last question from the Q&A.

999
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
This is actually a two-parter for both of you.

1000
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
We have Poseidon Bobby was asking Charles, does your shirt glow in the dark?

1001
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
You know, I haven't tried, but it looks like it might.

1002
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
It looks like it might.

1003
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
It looks like it should.

1004
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
At least you might have a glow-in-the-dark bowling for sure would light up.

1005
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I am being told it doesn't and I demand a refund.

1006
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I would like to get a glow-in-the-dark-lilith shirt now.

1007
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
What a rip-off, man.

1008
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:57,000
And then on a similar vein, Aislinn, Radiobiology, was asking, can you buy that sweater?

1009
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Can you buy this wonderful holiday Lilith's Christmas sweater?

1010
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I don't know.

1011
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Adam is saying it's sold out.

1012
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
It's sold out?

1013
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It's sold out.

1014
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It's sold out for over a year.

1015
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Sold out for over a year.

1016
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
This is a one-of-a-kind.

1017
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
We did have a different holiday sweater this past year, so there should, I mean, hopefully

1018
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
be another holiday sweater next year.

1019
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
No guarantees.

1020
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Yeah.

1021
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
But yeah, if you do see those holiday sweaters in the shop, get them before they're gone.

1022
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
There's always really wonderful merch online for Diablo.

1023
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I love taking a look at it.

1024
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:33,000
So if you like Diablo merch and you want something like this, definitely check it periodically.

1025
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Definitely grab it.

1026
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Well, yeah, that brings us to the end of the stream.

1027
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I want to give a really big thank you to Aislinn, Charles, Dan Tanguay.

1028
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Thank you so much for hanging out with us all the way in snowy Albany, New York.

1029
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I hope it's not too terribly cold.

1030
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Not too bad.

1031
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Okay.

1032
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Okay.

1033
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Glad to hear it.

1034
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I have to say that room looks freezing.

1035
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
It's like a thung shit.

1036
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
It does look very cold.

1037
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
It's a little chilly.

1038
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Yeah.

1039
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
But I got my jacket on.

1040
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I'm all right.

1041
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Good.

1042
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Nice.

1043
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Glad to hear it.

1044
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,000
And Twitch, YouTube, TikTok, everyone, thank you for staying tuned and checking out everything

1045
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
that's to come with the season of Witchcraft.

1046
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Like we mentioned throughout the stream, patch notes will be dropping after the stream.

1047
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
We did have our blog that launched on Tuesday as well.

1048
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Also, I got to give a massive shout out again to our production team.

1049
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
There's a lot of faces you don't see that put a ton of blood, sweat, and tears into the show.

1050
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
These heads are absolutely disgusting.

1051
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And I don't know if anybody needs more of a reason to brush your teeth, but you know,

1052
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
don't end up looking like that guy.

1053
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
No.

1054
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Season of Witchcraft does start on January 21st at 10 a.m. PST.

1055
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
So be sure to go in.

1056
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And for anyone who hasn't yet completed your Season Journey, your Battle Pass, check your

1057
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Seasonal Stash or Eternal Stash as well before those items disappear.

1058
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
But yeah, we got Season of Witchcraft on January 21st.

1059
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Super excited to get into it.

1060
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Thank you from all of us here at Blizzard and we will see you at the Tree of Whispers.

1061
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Thanks, guys.

1062
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
You're welcome.

1063
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
We'll see you next time.

1064
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
We'll see you next time.

1065
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Bye.

1066
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Bye.

1067
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Bye.

1068
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Bye.

1069
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Bye.

1070
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Bye.
