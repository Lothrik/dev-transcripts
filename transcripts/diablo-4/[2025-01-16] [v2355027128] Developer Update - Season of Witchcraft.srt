1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the season of Wishcraft, the tree is missing some of its heads, which, spoilers, is actually

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
a big deal.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Someone has stolen heads from the Tree of Whispers, and it is the Wanderer's role to

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
discover the mystery behind who is taking the heads and to what end.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
As you progress through the storyline, you work with the coven, and in exchange for your

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
help, they will give you their own powers, and you can utilize these powers in Season of

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Witchcraft.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you're not familiar, the Tree of Whispers is this ancient tree with heads.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You can come and ask for favors from the tree itself, but it will ask for something in return.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Notoriously, no one has been able to get out of their deal with the Tree of Whispers until

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
now.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who is it that's been freeing these heads from the Tree of Whispers, and what are the fugitive

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
heads themselves trying to accomplish now that they're free from the tree?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And these stolen heads are scattered all around sanctuary, causing chaos and spreading strange

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
rot, taking over the bodies of the living.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Head rotten are what happens when a head from the Tree of Whispers attempts to graft itself

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
onto an already living creature to reclaim that life.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They retain some of the tree's power.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Brambles and roots grow along the inside of these creatures, bursting out and causing them

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to essentially have a head detach.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And they don't mind sacrificing their living victims in their pursuit to live again.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
During the course of the Season of Witchcraft, you're going to work with different witches

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to help solve the mystery of the missing heads.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The witches of Hawassar are a coven of witches and chose to serve the Tree of Whispers in exchange

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
for its power.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
At this point, hatred is spreading all throughout sanctuary.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And for the first time, it's managed to launch an attack at the Tree of Whispers.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And though the tree is still standing, it's definitely worse for wear.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And the witches that are bound to the tree have to set things right.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Investigate, hunt down these heads, and through gathering strength in their witch powers to

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
deal with the encroaching threat, they will be able to uncover what the mystery is.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In exchange for your help, the witches are offering you their witch powers.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And this season, you're going to be able to tap into three major categories of witchcraft power.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Una has Eldritch powers, which are tied to the cycle of life and death.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Eldritch powers are the witch's form of dealing damage directly to enemies in the form of fire

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
damage, burning damage, shadow damage.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Galena has power over psyche, which is illusion, and seeing the unseen.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Powers of the mind, will, and soul.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And they're the ones that protect you in battle.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Growth and decay powers are powers of the swamp.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Kaden deals with the body, disease and poultices, familiars.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They're the ones that decay your enemies and heal you in battle.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So you might be going for a fire sorceress, for example, and decide that you want to have

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
ancient mystical frogs helping you in some way.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
These are going to be things that you're going to play with to get new levels of power

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and unique builds that really are special to just this season.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Every class can use every power for every build.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There is also lost witchcraft power that can be found while you're adventuring.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is a special witchcraft power that exists outside the purview of traditional witchcraft powers.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So as players progress through the storyline and they complete whispers, they will earn a seasonal currency.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This seasonal currency is used to, one, purchase witch powers and also upgrade your witchcraft powers.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
An example of an eldritch power would be a new power, Doom Orb, an ominous orb of pure eldritch energy

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that circles you and burns enemies with fire damage.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Doom Orb gets stronger as you slay enemies and will eventually explode.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Doom Orb will also launch itself at enemies if no enemies are near you.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So we do have some returning fan favorites coming back in season of witchcraft.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Players who are fans of our franchise will remember some of these powers are from Diablo 3, specifically the witch doctor.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Firebats is returning from Diablo 3.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Those who have played the witch doctor also remember the hex skill, the toad of hugeness.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
However, it's been reimagined for Diablo 4 and Season of Witchcraft.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is the poison frog servant.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I just think it's adorable and I want to have a murderous pet frog follow me from sanctuary.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Of all the witchcraft powers, something tells me that players are probably going to be the most excited about Piranada.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's effectively a whirlwind of water and chomping piranhas that will just shred your enemies to pieces.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And yes, it does pull enemies towards it.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So players will be unlocking and upgrading their various witchcraft powers through performing head hunts.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're going to see that there's an area in the world where the tree of whispers has detected fugitive heads.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The head rotten are there.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You need to go hunt them down.

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
When they interact with other monsters in the world of sanctuary, best case scenario, they horrifically corrupt that monster to become a new headless form of itself.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Worst case, they actually affix themselves to a monster and become a new boss-like entity that has this ancient rotting head on top of this now puppeteered body.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There is a horror in them, a sort of Frankenstein-esque monster.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So they have more humanoid traits but even stronger powers.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like flaming swords they're going to be throwing at you or they might be using poison axes that are hurled your way or even shadow spears that tear up the ground.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So these are going to be some new encounters that you've never seen before.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
As you perform various whispers in the area, hopefully you see briars out in the world.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
These are going to indicate that there's a head rot in there.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you manage to successfully take down one of the head rotten and claim a fugitive head, this can be returned to the witches at the tree of whispers.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And you're going to get special seasonal sock-tables as a reward.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
On top of that, there will be some new whispers out there.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You might have a chance to help a bewitched frog or there might be a lost wisp that needs to find its way home.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
As you engage in these whispers, you're going to get reputation with the witches as well as seasonal currency that you can use to unlock and upgrade your witch powers.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So we've seen a lot of great feedback from our players on what are the various features that they most want to see in Diablo 4 to make our game even better.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
One that's come up quite a few times is an armory.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
When you save a build in the armory, it's going to take a snapshot of everything currently on your character.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Skill tree, paragon boards, your glyphs on those boards, and all of your gear.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Players will be able to access the armory UI from any major city.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're going to be able to pursue multiple different builds on one class at the same time.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This can be pretty cool when leveling up, but it's especially fun once you get into the end game.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
At that point, whenever you find a cool item that, oh man, this is really strong, but not for the build I'm running right now, oh, but you can still use it.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can still save out separate sets and try to pursue getting really powerful setups of very different versions of your class at the same time.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I am excited of what it could feel like to constantly be swapping between these different builds and seeing which one is the most powerful.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm excited for people to just immerse themselves in the season.

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Me personally, I'm very likely going to be running a companion druid build with the grow power to have a giant werewolf army.

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hell yes.

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We have a quest line that is different and emotionally gut-wrenching.

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
New wish powers, fugitive heads, new whispers.

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Really interesting bosses that have unique attack patterns.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Uniques, legendaries, and new runes for Vessel of Hatred players.

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There's a lot to try out here, some builds that have never been present before.

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm excited to see what players do with it.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first Diablo stream of 2025.

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We had an excellent holiday break, super relaxed, and very excited to bring you Season of Witchcraft.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes.

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You might have seen this Tuesday.

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We announced Season of Witchcraft is coming on January 21st.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We've got an excellent show for you today.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Today we're joined by some familiar faces.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You know Mr. Charles Dunn.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Welcome.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hi, I'm Charles.

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm a game designer on the Live Balance team.

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I'm Aislinn Hall.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I am a systems designer on Live Balance.

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Aislinn, great to have you back.

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And all the way from Albany, New York, Mr. Dan Tanguay.

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Welcome back to the stream.

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hey, everybody.

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How's it going?

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm Dan Tanguay.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm the design director for Live Services.

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Awesome.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, thanks for joining us, Dan.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
As you can all see, Season of Witchcraft is upon us.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Huge shout-out to our production team.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We've got some absolutely disgusting heads that we bore from the True Whispers.

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can't see on this guy yet.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I might give him a spin later on, but the teeth on him are absolutely horrible.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh, my.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So, yeah, without further ado, to give you a brief overview for the stream, we're going

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
to walk you through the seasonal content.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So, Season of Witchcraft.

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Excited to get into it.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Then we'll head over to some Class and Balance updates, give you a brief preview of some new

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
uniques coming to the season.

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Should be pretty exciting.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And then we'll have some system updates and get into some exciting features coming in

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the Season of Witchcraft that have been much anticipated for a long time.

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then stick around because we'll do a Q&A towards the tail end of the stream.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And we'll get into all your questions.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So, I do have Twitch chat open that I'm looking at, and we will be collecting questions throughout

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
the stream for our devs to answer.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But before we jump into Season of Witchcraft, we do want to cast ourselves all the way back

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
to the start of December where we had the 2.1 PTR.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Thank you to everyone who jumped into this PTR.

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There was a ton of content, and we did have some exciting features.

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Like, I've got to ask you, Aislinn.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Like, how did it feel to get the armory finally into this place?

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh, my gosh.

150
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I've been waiting for so long.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm so glad it's finally here.

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The armory feels amazing to use.

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's so great to finally have it in the game.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Anyone who hasn't had a chance to try it yet, it's going to be a godsend in Season 7.

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're going to love it.

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's just such a useful tool.

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And we'll go more into the details later, but wonderful.

158
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Absolutely.

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh.

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh.

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Charles, did you get any feedback on Unix?

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Any balance changes?

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
From the PTR, we got a lot of great feedback on balance and all the new content for classes,

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
like the new Uniques, new Legendaries, all the tweaks and adjustments to skills.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Your feedback's been invaluable.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Not only, like, feedback written up on social media or on our forums or elsewhere,

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
but also just, like, in the raw data, the player data, our telemetry has been very helpful

172
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
in making sure that this season and every season is as best as it can be when it actually launches.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah.

174
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's a great point, Charles.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Like, one thing we did want to touch on is even if you don't see your feedback represented

176
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
throughout the stream, because we will be touching on different feedback across all

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
the sections from our PTR, we do still internalize all that feedback and take it through and help,

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
you know, make decisions throughout future seasons.

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So all the feedback is very much appreciated and really does help inform that content.

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But yeah, there was a ton to chew on in the PTR.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Like, we had all our Witchcraft powers in there.

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like, there's an absolute smattering of content.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But very excited to throw it over to Dan Tangway.

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Can you let us know what players can expect in Season of Witchcraft?

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, let's talk about the Season of the Witchcraft.

186
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There's a lot to cover at this point.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You got a bigger chunk of it than you had in previous seasons in the PTR.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But still, we've got some surprises in store that we want to share with you all.

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So let's get started.

190
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
First off, the Season of Witchcraft, dozens of heads are missing from the Tree of Whispers.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And so the tree is hell-bent and really just ticked off.

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It wants to find them.

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I mean, these heads were part of a bargain.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The tree is all about keeping your word.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And now that bargain is broken.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So yeah, the tree is mad.

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Full stop.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Now, the Witches have summoned you to the tree.

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And they're offering you a deal.

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If you can get those heads back for them,

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
they'll offer you the secrets of Witchcraft.

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So that's where we begin.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And the first thing, we're going to have an all-new quest line.

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And that new quest line is going to be you unraveling the mystery of those missing heads.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And while you're doing that, like I said, you're going to be earning Wild Witchcraft and Occult Gems.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We have a new activity called Head Hunts.

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And that's going to allow you to pursue Whispers, slay Head Rotten,

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
which is the new enemies, the new family of enemies that we have this season.

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And find those missing heads.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In addition to the head hunts, you're also going to have Root Holds.

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
These are new micro dungeons that allow you to discover bonus Head Rotten and also their bosses.

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And then finally, we've got some updates to the season journey that we'll cover,

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
including a new pet named Dorian, which is a pet raven.

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is our first flying pet, so we're pretty excited about that.

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Let's talk about some of the powers.

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So Witchcraft, at least as we're defining it this season,

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
it allows its practitioners to call upon the power of the swamp to do their bidding.

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And there are three schools of magic within Witchcraft.

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We've got Eldritch Witchcraft, and that's uncanny magic that, you know,

220
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
is just weird and bizarre and very of the swamp.

221
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You've got Psyche Powers.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
These are powers of the mind and spirit.

223
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And we've got Growth and Decay.

224
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And that's magic that both heals and harms your enemies.

225
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm going to take a look at it.

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Some of these in action.

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So first up, we're going to have Eldritch Powers once we get our clip going.

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And right here, we're seeing that we've got Fire Bats,

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
which is a classic power from the Witch Doctor that we brought back this season,

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
paired up with Doom Orb.

231
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Next up, we've got some Psyche Powers here.

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And we're using Vengeful Spirit, which is kind of hanging around you

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and zooming between enemies.

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And the Aura of Lament, where you see these psychic projections of hands come out of the ground

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and slow your enemies.

236
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And finally, we've got Growth and Decay magic.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And you watch right there.

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Your wolves got really big all of a sudden.

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's Grow magic.

240
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And that's been paired up with the Poison Frog, which you see in the corner,

241
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
wailing away on the head rotten there.

242
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So those are some good examples of the types of magics that you're going to be able to use in this season.

243
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And you'll start seeing them sprinkled all throughout the rest of the clips that we're about to show you.

244
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Next up, let's talk about the head hunts.

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So I said before, the tree was really mad, right?

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because it's missing its heads.

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And so what it's doing is actually calling out all new whispers.

248
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And it's just furiously, furiously searching for these heads.

249
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But it can't do it on its own.

250
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So when it calls out a particular zone, because it knows roughly where the heads are,

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
it calls its agents to help it out.

252
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And you're one of the tree's agents.

253
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So you can go and solve some of those whispers and get rewarded for them.

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Now, the head hunts are special zone takeovers that complement the helltides.

255
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So folks on the PTR called them witch tides.

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Sure, you can call them that.

257
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But the idea is that these aren't just replacing helltides.

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
They're there to supplement them in terms of what you can do in the overworld.

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Now, these are going to be swarming with head rotten, those enemies we talked about before.

260
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The head rotten are monsters that have fallen under the influence of the missing heads.

261
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And the heads have transformed them in really grotesque ways.

262
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Now, these head hunts, like I mentioned, are going to feature all new whispers mixed with some existing ones as well.

263
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Completing a whisper unlocks what's called an exposed root.

264
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And that gives you a chance of actually triggering what is a cocoon.

265
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And these uprooted cocoons have a chance of then spawning a head rotten boss.

266
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So every time you complete a whisper, you've got a chance at triggering a boss.

267
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And occasionally a boss will spawn from one of these and then everyone in the zone can work together to try and take down that boss.

268
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And if you're really lucky, that boss will have one of the missing heads associated with it.

269
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So let's take a look at some of this in action here.

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Now, first up, we're going to check out one of our new whispers.

271
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is a shepherd whisper.

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This is allowing you to, you know, guide some of these innocent wildlife in this area to safety.

273
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You know, very simple.

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But, you know, the witches want to make sure that no one's harmed by the head rotten.

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Next up, we've got some villagers that are trapped in Bramble in an Entangled Whisper.

276
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And so you're trying to defeat all the enemies around there in order to free the villager there.

277
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Following that, we're actually going to get a view of one of the exposed roots as it transforms into this uprooted cocoon.

278
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And so much like some other open world boss fights, there's going to be some combat leading up to the boss spawning.

279
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And that first cocoon actually didn't have a boss in it, but you still got some rewards from it.

280
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So we're going to see if this second cocoon has a boss in it.

281
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So we're, you know, continuing to clear head rotten.

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And indeed, a boss does spawn.

283
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Now, unfortunately, it's not a boss with a missing head.

284
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This is a headless husk.

285
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But still, it's going to be pretty rewarding to defeat this.

286
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So hopefully everyone in the area realizes that, you know, there's a boss in the air and they're going to come help you defeat this.

287
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And yeah, that is a good peek at what head hunts are going to be.

288
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But let's go back to the tree now because I really want to take you through some of the steps on how to learn new witchcraft.

289
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So let's talk about that.

290
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So the first thing that's really important when you want to learn new witchcraft is that you're always going to be earning covenants favor from completing whispers.

291
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And that's going to unlock new witchcraft at certain tiers of the coven favor board.

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Now, additionally, as you're killing those head rotten that I showed you before, you're going to be earning restless rot.

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Now, restless rot is something that you can offer as proof of a kill to the altar to earn that new witchcraft.

294
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And then you can use it also to upgrade your witchcraft directly in your UI.

295
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
One final note I want to make here is that we decided to use witchcraft and the seasonal powers as a way to help boost your alts.

296
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So that means that whenever you upgrade and unlock a piece of witchcraft, that's going to stay upgraded and locked for all your characters on your account for the rest of the season.

297
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So it's going to be a great leg up for, you know, trying new characters in the future.

298
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But let's take a look at some of this in action.

299
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
All right. So here we are in the Tree of Whispers area and we're looking at the coven rep board.

300
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And we'll see right up here that on rank seven, you actually unlock some more witchcraft.

301
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So we're going to go over to our altar now.

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Now at the altar, we're going to take a look at a list of things that you haven't learned yet.

303
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And each of these costs restless rot to earn.

304
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And so you're going to learn grow.

305
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And now grow has appeared in your witchcraft inventory to the right.

306
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And you're also going to look at upgrading abyssal resonance.

307
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That was a bit of a mouthful.

308
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And we can upgrade it from rank three to four by just plying the restless rot directly.

309
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But head hunts aren't the only places that you're going to be able to find head rotten.

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And let's go.

311
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Actually, no, I'm skipping ahead.

312
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's talk about forgotten altars first.

313
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So there's a bit of a twist on earning some of your witchcraft.

314
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Not all the witchcraft that you can learn is actually known by the witches of Hawazar or the tree for that matter.

315
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Some of it has just been lost to the world.

316
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And so these take the form of lost powers that you can find on forgotten altars out in the dungeons of Sanctuary.

317
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So as you're adventuring through your dungeons, you will find some lost powers that you can't get anywhere else.

318
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And so it should be pretty exciting to stumble across one of these.

319
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Can't remember if there's a clip or not here.

320
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So let's take a look.

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
There it is indeed.

322
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And so real quick, you know, going through a dungeon, you see a forgotten altar, you interact with it, and then a new power is unlocked.

323
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Now, the cool thing about these is that if you find more altars, you can upgrade your powers by doing this.

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But you can also upgrade them through spending a premium price of restless rot.

325
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So you've got a couple options for upgrading these once you're able to find them.

326
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Now we're going to talk about the root holds, I think.

327
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So root holds.

328
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Root holds are micro dungeons.

329
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And so these micro dungeons are home to some of the head rotten and the head rotten bosses and the missing heads.

330
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They've gotten a little wise to what the tree's up to.

331
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So they're trying to hide underground.

332
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And so each of these contains a really concentrated population of head rotten and their rewards.

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And they require a new type of sigil called the whispering wood in order to access.

334
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And so these drop from whisper caches.

335
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So as you complete those whispers, you'll get more access to root holds, as well as silent chests, which actually are pretty common in the head hunt areas.

336
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So let's take a look at a root hold.

337
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
First off, we're going to open our inventory.

338
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And in there is going to be a whispering wood.

339
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And we're just going to trigger that like we would any nightmare dungeon.

340
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And then we're going to teleport right into our root hold.

341
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And I can take you through a little bit of that.

342
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
All right.

343
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Now we're in the root hold.

344
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And we're going to come upon a couple of interactions.

345
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Actually, four.

346
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
These are rites and ceremonies.

347
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
These are interactions that allow you to increase the challenge in the root hold in order to get more rewards.

348
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And if it reminds you a little bit of hell breaches, well, it is pretty similar.

349
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But unlike those, you can actually do multiple rites and ceremonies instead of just one.

350
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And when you take those on, then all the enemies and all the interactions afterwards have been impacted.

351
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And so we're going to fight through some of the head rotten here.

352
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Like I said, root holds are a pretty good spot to get a concentrated dose of them.

353
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And you also get a number of guaranteed roots that you can try and uproot as well, which is great.

354
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We'll watch a little bit more of this.

355
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And then we'll culminate with a boss.

356
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
One more battle first.

357
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But I'll say that each root hold is guaranteed to have a boss at the end,

358
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
which is nice if you want to start really trying to grind to get your missing heads.

359
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Now let's take a look at the boss.

360
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, well, this boss actually has a head.

361
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So that's pretty cool because a lot of them don't.

362
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So we're going to kill that boss and that boss is going to drop a missing head.

363
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And we're actually going to go take it back to the Tree of Whispers now.

364
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So taking it back to the Tree of Whispers, we're going to talk to a witch.

365
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And we're going to be able, in return for giving her this head, craft an occult gem.

366
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And this gem, I think we're going to craft as an Elder Sigil.

367
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And we're going to be able to slot that into one of our rings.

368
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So let's do that right now.

369
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Here we go.

370
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And the Elder Sigil is not only going to provide us some defense like you would get from your diamond or skull that you've slotted into a ring or a talent, not a talisman.

371
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah.

372
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But also, it's going to give you some additional bonuses above and beyond that.

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
But I'm dancing around it.

374
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
What are occult gems?

375
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And so let's talk a little bit more about what occult gems are at this point.

376
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So occult gems are special socketables.

377
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And these socketables are going to really help you fine-tune your build after you have kind of a good foundation of witchcraft.

378
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Now, they're crafted, like you saw using the missing heads returned to the Tree of Whispers.

379
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They can only be slotted in jewelry slots, though.

380
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Your talismans and your rings.

381
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And they only last for the season.

382
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Now, when items transfer to the Eternal Realm, they disappear forever.

383
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
And they build on top of your witchcraft powers.

384
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You know, they're going to provide item and skill bonuses for certain witchcraft combinations.

385
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So if you really like the Piranado, for example, you're going to be investing in Hex and Aura.

386
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And if you invest a lot in Hex and Aura, it probably is wise to try and find an occult gem that also builds on top of those things as well.

387
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And that'll really allow you to fully enhance your build while you're entering and then playing through the endgame.

388
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
All right.

389
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So we've talked a bit about occult gems.

390
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:52,000
While we were putting all this together for Season of Witchcraft, we also saw some really good opportunities to improve the quality of life of the Whisper Loop.

391
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So let's talk through a couple of those right now.

392
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
First off, we've updated the town area around the Tree of Whispers.

393
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Previously, it was kind of small.

394
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It was, you know, home to a number of outcasts.

395
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And that group of outcasts has grown this season.

396
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Not only do the witches make home there, but there's a couple of new people there that provide additional services.

397
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And we've also actually put an extra armory in there, too, so you can make use of that.

398
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Now, while you're out in head hunts, we've also added a new feature called the Raven of the Tree.

399
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And this allows you to basically make submissions to the Tree of Whispers, turn in your grim favor in order to be able to get a cache immediately on the spot instead of having to return to the, you know, the Tree of Whispers itself.

400
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And, you know, it's convenient, sure, but it also allows you to really stay in the moment if, for example, you know, a new boss is triggered or something like that from an uprooted cocoon.

401
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And you want to join in that, you go over to the Raven of the Tree, turn in your grim favor, and then get right back into the battle again.

402
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And finally, we've got some ancestral caches.

403
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
These are a new type of cache that we've added that guarantees an ancestral item.

404
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And we wanted to make sure just that the Whisper Loop had, you know, a full range of items that it could drop.

405
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So we're pretty excited to be able to share all of these with you, as well as some new improvements to the Season Journey.

406
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So let's talk through those real quick.

407
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Now, with the Season Journey, we realized that a lot of casual players use the Season Journey as a way to figure out what to do next.

408
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And we also realized that our early chapters hadn't really been helping the casual players as much as we would have liked.

409
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So we've reworked a lot of those early objectives to help casual players more because we want to see more of them get into the endgame.

410
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Now, the later chapters, though, didn't feel especially challenging to us.

411
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So we've tried to improve that.

412
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Chapter 7 especially, we've reworked to really provide some more aspirational goals for players.

413
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And this is something that we're just going to continue working on in future seasons as well.

414
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Now, we've asked you to do a lot more in terms of the objectives.

415
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So we wanted to make sure we gave you a really great reward, too.

416
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So this is where you can earn Dorian the Raven.

417
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And like I said at the top, this is our first flying pet, which is pretty awesome.

418
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So let's take a look.

419
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You know, I am pretty excited to get Dorian.

420
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I have a feeling that flying pets are pretty much going to be my new favorite moving forward.

421
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So, yeah, definitely looking forward to this one.

422
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, yeah.

423
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Dorian's going to be wonderful.

424
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You know, Ravens love shinies.

425
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So him picking up your gold is just perfect.

426
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Right on.

427
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah.

428
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Green point.

429
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah.

430
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And finally, I think I'd like to chat through some PTR stuff.

431
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So Charles is going to cover a lot of the updates we made to the powers and occult gems because that's what his team focused on.

432
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:09,000
But the seasons team really focused on some of the head hunts and systems and took a lot of your feedback and really tried to improve the game prior to launch.

433
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So here's a couple of things that I just want to cover real quick.

434
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
First off, the multiplayer head hunts felt overwhelming for a lot of new players.

435
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And so we've done a number of things to tweak the head hunts to make sure that they don't feel as overwhelming.

436
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
First off, we've, you know, made some targeted reductions to the number of elites.

437
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
There were just a lot of elites on the PTR.

438
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And so you're still going to have a lot of monster density as you're fighting through these head hunts.

439
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But hopefully this will make things a little more manageable because we also had to reduce the number of, not the number of bosses, but the frequency at which they spawned.

440
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:03,000
So we've got bad luck protection to make sure that, you know, you will eventually see a boss spawn as you're playing through a head hunt.

441
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But we had to dial that down just a little bit because they were coming up quite, quite often.

442
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We've also reduced the number of low value item drops.

443
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You know, we had heard from a number of you that you were spending more time picking up a lot of items that really weren't good instead of actually battling the head rotten, which is what we want you to do.

444
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
We've also reduced the number of active head hunt zones from five to four.

445
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And then finally, we're going to add a new HUD element.

446
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:40,000
A number of folks have pointed out that it wasn't really clear that completing whispers was the thing that actually triggered the roots and then the cocoons.

447
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And so we've got a HUD element that will definitely illustrate that better.

448
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Unfortunately, that's not going to come till release 2.1.1, which is going to be roughly two weeks out from launch.

449
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Now, head rotten, especially bosses, were not challenging enough.

450
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So that's another thing that we've looked to address.

451
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We've increased the head rotten barrier effect.

452
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Previously, it was around half health.

453
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We've made that full health now.

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And we gave the head rotten a very small percentage of damage reduction as well.

455
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
We've given you a lot of cool new powers and form of witchcraft to play with.

456
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
We want to make sure the head rotten serve is a good challenge for you as you're building out your witchcraft powers.

457
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Next up, head rotten bosses were just not rewarding enough across the board.

458
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So we've increased their rewards to a level that's closer to a blood maiden than what they were previously.

459
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And then finally, some players didn't quite understand how to earn an upgrade witchcraft.

460
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
So we made some changes to help with that.

461
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Each alter is going to contain the same inventory now instead of having unique inventories.

462
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And that way, you don't need to try and figure out which alter you need to go to in order to learn something.

463
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And we've also rewritten a lot of the tooltip descriptions to make sure that we're very clear about where you can go to get things.

464
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But yeah, I think that covers it for PTR learnings.

465
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And I'm trying to think if there's anything else, but I think I'll pass it back to Irvine.

466
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
No, I think you covered all of it, Dan.

467
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That was incredible.

468
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That was an absolute ton of content.

469
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
There's just so much to dive into with this season.

470
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I think I can speak for everyone between root holes, witchcraft powers, occult gems.

471
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
There's just so much in the mix to dive in and get used to.

472
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And it all kind of comes back to head hunts that you can kind of use as a zone to get into all the content, which is super exciting.

473
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So Dan, thanks so much for walking us through all of that.

474
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I know we've got more details coming out in our patch notes following the stream.

475
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And we do have some of those witchcraft powers already existing in our blog.

476
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So if you want more information on those, you can check those out.

477
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But Dan's going to stick around because we will be bringing Dan back for our Q&A section at the end of the stream.

478
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So if you have any questions on Dory and the Raven or on witchcraft powers, occult gems,

479
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
or anything to do with Season of Witchcraft, please drop those in chat and we'll grab them throughout the stream.

480
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But for all of you who are kind of theory crafting and build crafting and thinking about like,

481
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
okay, what's my play style going to be for Season of Witchcraft?

482
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You're probably already thinking about the different occult gems, the different witchcraft powers.

483
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But to finish off that equation, of course, you need to get all the balance updates for the season.

484
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So Charles, can you take us through what's coming?

485
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Of course.

486
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, I'd love to talk about how you're going to attack these head rotten.

487
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Like, what is your build going to look like and what are some of the new uniques and legendaries that you're going to get to play with in this season?

488
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
First, before we get into each individual class, I want to talk about some of our broader initiatives on the class design side

489
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that kind of affect every class in some way.

490
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Specifically, I wanted to talk about how we did some ultimate skill updates in this patch.

491
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
For ultimate skills, we're now able to get skill ranks on them starting in Season 6, the previous season.

492
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But now once you get them up to rank 5, you're going to get a special bonus.

493
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And we found these to be really flashy and fun on the PTR.

494
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
People love playing with ultimates and you get to cast them more often.

495
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
They've got more effects.

496
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
They had some scaling ways to scale their damage with these rank 5 bonuses sometimes.

497
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
We did find that some of those exact scaling numbers were a little on the higher side.

498
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
They were a little bit more powerful and kind of crowding out non-ultimate builds.

499
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We love that people are playing these and we want them to be powerful.

500
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But there are certainly some times when it's a little too much and it feels like you can't play anything else.

501
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So we are taking a pass across the board on some of those ultimate scalians to bring them down just a little bit.

502
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But we still expect them to be very powerful and very fun.

503
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Secondarily, we've got the summons update.

504
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
This was a big pass across summons from Necromancer, their skeletons, druid companions.

505
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Rogue Shadow Clone is a big one.

506
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Oh, yes.

507
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And then even Sorcerer Conjurations and the Barbarian Ancients even.

508
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So for the summons update, without getting too technical into it,

509
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,000
essentially what happened was all of the damage that your summons do is going to be attributed to the player

510
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and not to a separate entity that's kind of separated from you.

511
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And what that ultimately means is that all of those summons will now inherit your damage bonuses more consistently.

512
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Anything that says you deal increased damage affects your summons.

513
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Just out of the box, it works for everything.

514
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's just more consistent interaction across the board.

515
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Any of your lucky hit effects that says, hey, you've got a lucky hit chance to stun an enemy.

516
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
All of the damage from your summons also can trigger that now.

517
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And this is great for consistency across the board.

518
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Previously, it was sometimes inconsistent.

519
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
What would work with what?

520
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And I'm particularly excited about Shadow Clone, as we'll talk about in the Rogue section coming up.

521
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But that was one that historically really never hit the mark for an ultimate skill.

522
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And with this new update, we think Shadow Clone is going to really live up to the promise of really duplicating your actions

523
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
in a way that feels meaningful and does tons of damage exactly like you'd expect it to.

524
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Oh, it's going to be very powerful.

525
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm looking forward to it.

526
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And summons truly are just an extension of you now in all of your power.

527
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
They're inheriting all of that properly, and they're going to blast.

528
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's going to be great.

529
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Absolutely.

530
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,000
The one last kind of big picture item that we took away from the PTR was about crowd control effects.

531
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
We noticed that there is a whole lot of what I call incidental crowd control effects,

532
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
things that happen from lucky hits or procs, specifically from the worldly fortune tempering manual

533
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that gives you lucky hit chance to stun or chance to freeze an enemy,

534
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
as well as particularly from the fist of fate unique item.

535
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
We found that it was often the most common way to build your character in the late game

536
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
was to really stack up these effects, and then you're just applying a lot of crowd control

537
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
on this lucky hit cadence rather than actively pressing crowd control buttons or really opting into it.

538
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And we do think that once it gets to a certain point of that, it can make our combat less engaging,

539
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
where enemies just randomly get stunned or frozen without you really having too much input into that.

540
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But then it also makes it very frustrating when you don't lucky hit,

541
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and an enemy hits you that you expected to have got hit with this.

542
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So we're looking to potentially address that in a future season or future updates.

543
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
We don't have any changes regarding the crowd control here in Season 7,

544
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
but it's one of those examples of the learnings that we're going to take forward to future seasons

545
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and potentially look at improving this so that we can make our combat feel that much more engaging

546
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and actually get a little bit of back and forth between you and the enemies a bit more than there currently is,

547
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
especially in the hyper late game situation when your characters are really maxed out.

548
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So with that in mind, let's get on to some of the individual classes, starting with the Barbarian.

549
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So the Barbarian on the Season 7 PTR was performing quite solidly.

550
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
We were pretty happy with where Barbarian landed.

551
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
We are really excited about Hammer of the Ancients and this Earthquake build with the new unique,

552
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
which we'll show in a moment.

553
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
We do think the Hammer of the Ancients part of that maybe could use a little bit more numerical buffs,

554
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
so we threw some buffs there, as well as to Whirlwind.

555
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That build was definitely falling a bit behind some of the other builds.

556
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But on the whole, we definitely expect Barbarian to be really powerful and a strong option going forward.

557
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Let's take a look at that new unique item, the Mantle of Mountain's Fury.

558
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Oh, yes.

559
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This empowers your Hammer of the Ancients to cause a seismic line,

560
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and if that line hits an earthquake, it's going to explode that earthquake for massive damage and big fire explosions.

561
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Looks so sweet.

562
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's very intense.

563
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Very powerful, and right on the Barbarian fantasy of just hitting things with big weapons, making earthquakes, making explosions.

564
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yeah, that's ludicrous.

565
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I love it because the flavor of Hammer of the Ancients is like, hit the ground and smash it.

566
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And this is just taking that and amplifying it by like 100 times.

567
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Oh, absolutely.

568
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So really excited for this and to see how this build performs in Season of the Witchcraft.

569
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Up next, we've got the Sorceress.

570
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So the Sorceress, kind of in contrast to the Barbarian, was by far the weakest class on the PTR.

571
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
No getting around that.

572
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,000
We definitely made some adjustments going into this season that we think maybe overshot and brought Sorceress down a little further than we'd be happy with.

573
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Particularly changes to Conjuration and Burning bonuses.

574
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
We're happy with how that affected build variety, but the overall power level suffered.

575
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So with that in mind, we're going to do a lot of buffs on, mainly on the passive effects for the class, to really kind of bring all of their numbers up by just a little bit across the board.

576
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I specifically wanted to call out our changes to Searing Heat and Icefall.

577
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
These are legendary Paragon nodes that previously were very build specific, like you would only use Searing Heat in a Burning build.

578
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
We've made some tweaks to it where it's still good in a Burning build.

579
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's probably better.

580
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But it also has some applications across all builds and all damage types.

581
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So these will just be a little bit more generically applicable, but still very good for the build that they were initially intended for.

582
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Right.

583
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
With that in mind, I want to show some of the updates to Firebolt enchantment.

584
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
This is one that we had reworked as part of those Burning changes, and we thought even on the PTR it wasn't quite hitting the mark.

585
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So now, dealing Burning damage, if you take this enchantment, will have a chance to heal you for some of your maximum life, which it already did.

586
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And it also unleashes a bonus Firebolt onto a nearby enemy.

587
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So that you can see in this clip here, when enemies are burning, they're just randomly firing off some extra Firebolts to nearby enemies that can really help to spread that Burning and take down big packs.

588
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah, it's its own little chain Firebolt now.

589
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Exactly.

590
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Yeah.

591
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Also, I want to highlight some of the new uniques coming in this season.

592
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So Sorceress has two.

593
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The Strike of Stormhorn is a unique focus that's going to modify your Ball Lightning to give you Super Ball Lightning sometimes.

594
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So it'll always fire out straightforward, and it's a little bit faster.

595
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And occasionally, you'll get the Super Ball Lightning, which will explode for a big chunk of damage at the end in a cone shape, and also stun enemies.

596
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It's kind of like going bowling.

597
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Exactly.

598
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And you get a Strike of Stormhorn.

599
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Exactly.

600
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Alternatively, you could take the other unique focus that is being introduced in this season, Okun's Catalyst, to kind of play Ball Lightning the way it's often been played in the past, with this gravitational effect.

601
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:26,000
We've done some reworks on the gravitational aspect that previously did that, and now it will be in this unique, where the Ball Lightning will orbit around you and do damage to enemies who are close by.

602
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You really want to get close and in that action, whereas with Strike of Stormhorn, you're playing at a little bit more of a range.

603
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Right.

604
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
We really like how we're doing these paired uniques, where you kind of have a choice.

605
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Hey, what focus do I want to use?

606
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
They are going to be mutually exclusive.

607
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You can't have both.

608
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
They're in the same slot.

609
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But that's because they're so different, and they're different play styles.

610
00:41:46,000 --> 00:42:01,000
But we think putting these into different uniques gives us the space to really live up this fantasy, give you lots of affixes and bonuses that make it as powerful, and really to help enhance that fantasy that we're hoping to play.

611
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yeah, and Oaken's Catalyst really gives you that transformative Ball Lightning experience, which is like the orbiting Ball Lightning.

612
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But Strike of Stormhorn kind of just amplifies the original Ball Lightning experience, which is just shoot it out and have it explode in this magnificent blast of energy.

613
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So I love that we are allowing both of those to shine.

614
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Absolutely.

615
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
All right, on to the next class.

616
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
We've got the Druid.

617
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So the Druid on the PTR did have one bugged build.

618
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
One of their legendary Paragon nodes was causing their damage to scale way higher than we intended.

619
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Occasionally we'd even kind of break the game and go, you'd see negative damage numbers.

620
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Definitely not intended.

621
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,000
We fixed that bug.

622
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But despite that, we think Druid on the whole was still in a solid place even without that.

623
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
We've made a number of adjustments and reworked the Blurred Beast aspect.

624
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
This is one that we had tried out a rework on the PTR, and it wasn't quite hitting the mark.

625
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It wasn't quite as engaging to play as we had hoped, so we did a rework to it to help improve the Shred builds for Werewolf.

626
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Additionally, I wanted to highlight some of the Spirit Boon updates.

627
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
These were the Druid class mechanic.

628
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
You get these Spirit Boons.

629
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Historically, they've been a little bit falling behind, and we've done some big buffs here to make them really powerful.

630
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I especially like the Gift of the Stag.

631
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It's my favorite one.

632
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It gives you passive Spirit generation every second.

633
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yeah.

634
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
That really helps smooth out Druid's early game in particular when they're struggling to really get their resource engine online.

635
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
They were definitely one of the slower classes early on, and I think this update to the Spirit Boons is going to really help that.

636
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Yeah, totally, and that's just such a great example of how the update is going to help them because Druids have typically struggled with generating Spirit in the early game,

637
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and so having more access to that is going to help a ton.

638
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah.

639
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Let's take a look at a clip of the new Blurred Beast rework.

640
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So on the PTR, it would do some bonus strikes based on how far you traveled.

641
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Now your Shred will just always have a chance to land additional strikes, but it's going to roll that randomness four times.

642
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So if you get real lucky on your Shred, you're going to hit so many times on that target,

643
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
which really helps amplify the fantasy of werewolves striking fast, striking multiple times.

644
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah, this aspect is super fun to play, and I absolutely love what the art team did with this,

645
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
combining the mechanics of that feedback on the extra strikes with the actual additional slashes going out.

646
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It looks awesome.

647
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
All right, on to the Rogue.

648
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So the Rogue was a very strong class on the PTR.

649
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We thought it was in a great spot, very powerful, particularly with Reign of Arrows.

650
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah.

651
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Reign of Arrow builds were already a pretty common, pretty powerful build before the season,

652
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
but with the new changes to introduce the additional scaling damage on it, they were just absolutely top.

653
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yeah.

654
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So I will say that, of course, as part of addressing the ultimate changes across the board,

655
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
we did bring down the scaling a little bit on Reign of Arrows,

656
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
but we do think that it's still going to be a very compelling choice.

657
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Rogue and ultimate skills are going to be just fine going forward into the season.

658
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It'll be good.

659
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Also, I wanted to talk a little bit about Shadow Clone.

660
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I know I teased that earlier with the summons update.

661
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Shadow Clone was probably one of the biggest updates in this season to really make sure it worked with all of your damage,

662
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
all of your bonus effects, all of your procs,

663
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
and especially work with a lot of your legendary effects that modify your skills.

664
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So previously, if you had, say, if you're using Flurry,

665
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and you had the aspect of encircling blades that would cause Flurry to hit all around you,

666
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
your Shadow Clone wouldn't know that you have that.

667
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It would just kind of attack like a normal Flurry.

668
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
With this update, it'll now copy all of your legendary effects.

669
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Just as if you were casting the skill yourself,

670
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
it comes from the Shadow Clone,

671
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
and it works with all of those modifications.

672
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And that's huge.

673
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Absolutely.

674
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's a lot more damage.

675
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah.

676
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I really think, you know, I love Reign of Arrows,

677
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I love Death Trap, the other ultimate options on Rogue,

678
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
but I think Shadow Clone, it's time to shine.

679
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
It is.

680
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Shadow Clone hit the gym.

681
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Absolutely.

682
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Let's take a look at a clip of the new Shadow Clone in action.

683
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So here we've got the aspect of encircling blades,

684
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
the Flurry that I mentioned earlier.

685
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Oh, baby.

686
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Doing the big AoE around both you and the Shadow Clone.

687
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Additionally, with twisting blades,

688
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
when they come back and orbit around you,

689
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
that Blade Dancer's aspect,

690
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
they'll also come back and orbit around your Shadow Clone.

691
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Wonderful.

692
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Charles, you're going to make me do a Rogue Flurry Shadow Clone build this season.

693
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah, it should be great.

694
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Let me know how that works out.

695
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
All right, on to the Necromancer.

696
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So the Necromancer was probably the class that benefited most

697
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
from a bug with the scaling of the ultimates.

698
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
As I mentioned, there were some scaling with different stats.

699
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And whenever there was two stats involved,

700
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
particularly on Army of the Dead,

701
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
then it was actually increasing the damage far higher than we had intended.

702
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So we have fixed that bug and we've addressed it.

703
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
But with that in mind,

704
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Necromancer is definitely the biggest benefit of the Summons update.

705
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I know Shadow Clone is great,

706
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
but, you know, Necromancer is the Summons class.

707
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Of course.

708
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So they have by far the most.

709
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
All of their skeletons and their golems

710
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
are now going to much more consistently interact

711
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
with your lucky hit procs,

712
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
your bonus damage effects,

713
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
anything that, you know, increases your damage output

714
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
will also increase the damage output of your minions.

715
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And on the whole,

716
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
we really expect the Summon Necromancer

717
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
to be at its peak going into this season.

718
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Amazing.

719
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So channeling my Adam Jackson here.

720
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Minion stomps.

721
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Minion stomps are absolutely going up this season.

722
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
For sure.

723
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Additionally, we've got some new,

724
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
just like the Sorcerer,

725
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
we've got two uniques that talk to Bloodwave.

726
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
The unique, or the legendary,

727
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
sorry, the ultimate skill.

728
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
We've got two different unique pants

729
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
that can enhance your Bloodwave in different ways.

730
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Let's take a look at a clip of those.

731
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So first we've got Indriel's Memory.

732
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And this is going to be kind of your standard Bloodwave.

733
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You know, it still flies forward,

734
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
but when it hits the end,

735
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
it's going to trap enemies in a Bone Prison.

736
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Additionally, it modifies your Bone Spear

737
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
to also become a Blood skill.

738
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Now you've got a Blood Spear.

739
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Right.

740
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And with the inherent affix here,

741
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
casting your Bone Spear reduces Bloodwave's cooldown,

742
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
it really promotes the synergy between Blood and Bone.

743
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And you're going to get a nice loop of,

744
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
hey, cast the Bloodwave,

745
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and then trap them in that Bone Prison.

746
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Hey, that's perfect for lining up this Blood Spear.

747
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And by casting that,

748
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
you're going to reduce the cooldown in a Bloodwave

749
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
to be ready for the next pack.

750
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Right.

751
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
This unique alone really makes Blood and Bone,

752
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
like a Blood and Bone build,

753
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
come alive, which is cool.

754
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Absolutely.

755
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
The alternative,

756
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
you could use Kissimmee's Legacy.

757
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
This one changes Bloodwave.

758
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Instead of one wave going forward,

759
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
you've got two crashing in from both sides.

760
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And it's going to pull enemies towards you.

761
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And when it hits,

762
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
it's going to do a big pulse of damage in the middle.

763
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,000
That's awesome.

764
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's so cool.

765
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It's very transformational in the way you think about it,

766
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
the way you position it,

767
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and what your use case is, right?

768
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's not for pushing enemies away.

769
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It's for bringing them in close

770
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
and really wanting to be in the thick of combat there.

771
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Yeah, it really makes me think about

772
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
like a more melee or close range centered Necro build,

773
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
whereas Endira's Memory makes me think about

774
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
a ranged Necro build.

775
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Absolutely.

776
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
This pulls them in,

777
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
perfect for setting up a Blood Surge

778
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to hit enemies right around you.

779
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So definitely looking forward to see,

780
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
you know,

781
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
a Bloodwave being played in a number of different ways

782
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
in this new season.

783
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And finally,

784
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
we've got the Spiritborn,

785
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000
of course,

786
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
our newest class,

787
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
which is very strong.

788
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It was very strong in the previous season

789
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
or what's currently live on season six.

790
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
We did some adjustments

791
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
to some of the bug interactions

792
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
that was causing their damage to scale

793
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
way higher than intended,

794
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
as well as a handful of nerfs across the board

795
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
going into the PTR.

796
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
That being said,

797
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,000
on the PTR,

798
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
we still found them to be a very strong class,

799
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
arguably still the strongest.

800
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So with that in mind,

801
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
we didn't really make too many changes.

802
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
We really wanted to make sure

803
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
that we brought some of the other classes up

804
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
to that level,

805
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and we think the Spiritborn is in a good place.

806
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So there was actually a very minimal amount

807
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
of numerical adjustments

808
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
to Spiritborn going into this season.

809
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
With that in mind,

810
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I wanted to highlight the Razor Wings build.

811
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
There's a new unique item,

812
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
the Sunstained War Crozier,

813
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
as well as a new aspect,

814
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
the aspect of Endless Talons.

815
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That's going to really help

816
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
enhance this Razor Wing build.

817
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I think we've got a clip of that.

818
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So we've got the Sunstained War Crozier,

819
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
and that's going to enhance

820
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
all of your focus skills.

821
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
They automatically benefit

822
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,000
from all of our upgrades.

823
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You don't need to invest skill points in there.

824
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And by casting it,

825
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
you increase the damage

826
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,000
of your potency skill,

827
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
your Razor Wings,

828
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
whenever you're casting focus skills.

829
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
As Razor Wings is a potency skill.

830
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Yes, absolutely.

831
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yeah, so we're really looking forward

832
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
to seeing how this Razor Wings

833
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
was maybe a little bit underrepresented

834
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
on the current season,

835
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and we're really looking forward

836
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
to this unique

837
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
and the new Legendary

838
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
to really bring it up to par.

839
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
All right, so that covers

840
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
our class updates.

841
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And once again,

842
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I kind of went at high level

843
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
for each class

844
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
because the actual number

845
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
of changes were rather,

846
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,000
you know,

847
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
there's a lot more

848
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,000
that we didn't want

849
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
to just throw up

850
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
all the numbers

851
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
for every single class.

852
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So I kind of painted

853
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
a broad picture.

854
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Make sure you check out

855
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
the patch notes

856
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
for the actual changes

857
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
that should be coming

858
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
right after this stream.

859
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yeah, the patch notes

860
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
are massive,

861
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
so buckle up for those.

862
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
They're quite long.

863
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
If we went through those,

864
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,000
that would be like

865
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
a four-hour stream.

866
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Right.

867
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
But dive into those

868
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
post-stream, absolutely.

869
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Luckily,

870
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
for some of the Occult Gems

871
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and Witch Power updates,

872
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
we could fit kind of

873
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,000
all the changes

874
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
onto the side.

875
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So we're going to go

876
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
into a bit more numbers here.

877
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So let's take a look

878
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
at what we made updates

879
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
on the Occult Gems.

880
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I think on the whole,

881
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Occult Gems were pretty strong.

882
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
They were really hitting

883
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,000
that mark of,

884
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
they were appealing

885
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
to put into your jewelry,

886
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
the rings and the amulet.

887
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And they gave you

888
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
a lot of defense

889
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and a lot of other bonuses.

890
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Some of the bonuses,

891
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
maybe a touch high.

892
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So we brought some of them

893
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
down by just a little bit.

894
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Right.

895
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We still think on the whole,

896
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:12,000
these are going to be

897
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
really exciting,

898
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
moments to be able

899
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
to craft these

900
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
once you get those heads.

901
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I really like to call out

902
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
the update to Witching Hour

903
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
here at the end.

904
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
This is a Occult Gem

905
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
that modifies your core skill

906
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
to gain the Eldritch Tag.

907
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And that enables

908
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
some really interesting synergies

909
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
that you'll be able

910
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
to explore once you get

911
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,000
your hands on

912
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
the full Witchcraft system.

913
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But when it had a timer

914
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
of five seconds

915
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
in order to do this,

916
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,000
it was really hard

917
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
to build around.

918
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Yeah.

919
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And now reducing that

920
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
down to one second

921
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
means you can much more

922
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
consistently benefit

923
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
from this effect

924
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
and it really opens up

925
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,000
the build possibilities

926
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
with the Witching Hour

927
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Occult Gem.

928
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It was a bit too slow-paced

929
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
for how fast Diablo 4

930
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
is right now,

931
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
but with one second

932
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
on the timer,

933
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,000
it should be a lot

934
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
more playable.

935
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
For sure.

936
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
We've also made some updates

937
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
to the Witch Powers

938
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,000
themselves.

939
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And for the Witch Powers,

940
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
we think in general

941
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
these were probably

942
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
a touch weaker

943
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
than we'd like.

944
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So across the board,

945
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
there's some

946
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
numerical improvements,

947
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
especially on the

948
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Poisoned Frog Servant.

949
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
My favorite,

950
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
the little frog pet.

951
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,000
The wee beastie.

952
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Hell yeah.

953
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Oh man,

954
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
he got big buff.

955
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Love that guy

956
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
following us around

957
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and spitting the poison

958
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
and exploding

959
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
if he ever dies.

960
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yep.

961
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So yeah,

962
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000
on the whole,

963
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,000
we think Witch Powers

964
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
were pretty good.

965
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I love how flashy

966
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
they are in particular

967
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
and just how impactful

968
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
they look and feel.

969
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Our team did a great job

970
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
with all of these.

971
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Knocked it out of the park.

972
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
All right,

973
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and with that in mind,

974
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,000
there's also still

975
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
one additional new Witch Power

976
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
that we did not have

977
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,000
on the PTR.

978
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Oh, yes.

979
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
We've got the Force of Will.

980
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Now this is a Psyche Witch Power

981
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
that empowers your overpowers.

982
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
When you kill an enemy,

983
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
your next overpower

984
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,000
is going to gain

985
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
some increased damage

986
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
up to a maximum.

987
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And if you rank it up

988
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
to at least rank four,

989
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,000
it'll empower your next

990
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
two overpowers.

991
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Excellent.

992
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
This was one that

993
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
we were not able

994
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,000
to get out on the PTR

995
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
in time.

996
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
It had some issues,

997
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
but it was being

998
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,000
in development.

999
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But for the actual

1000
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
season launch,

1001
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
we're going to have this

1002
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
out there and available.

1003
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
We know it kind of

1004
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
really rounds out the roster

1005
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
of Witch Powers

1006
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
that were available.

1007
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Yep.

1008
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
We had, you know,

1009
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
one less Psyche Power

1010
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
than the others.

1011
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
This is the last one.

1012
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And we didn't really have

1013
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
too much support in there

1014
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
for overpower builds.

1015
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And now we do.

1016
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Voila.

1017
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So really excited

1018
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
about this one

1019
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
and helped to empower

1020
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
overpower.

1021
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
All right.

1022
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So I think that wraps up

1023
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
all of our balance changes.

1024
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Once again,

1025
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
check out the patch notes

1026
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
for the exact details.

1027
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But hope this, you know,

1028
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
gets your minds turning

1029
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
for build crafting

1030
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
for next week

1031
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,000
when the season launches.

1032
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah, there is absolutely

1033
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
a ton of chew on.

1034
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Like, I went into this stream

1035
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
absolutely thinking

1036
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I was going to roll

1037
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Spiritborn again.

1038
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And now I'm thinking

1039
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm going to have to go

1040
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Barb or Shadow Clone Rogue.

1041
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Those are so sweet.

1042
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Got my decisions cut out

1043
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
for me, that's for sure.

1044
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Absolutely.

1045
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And with the Armory,

1046
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
you're going to be able to pick,

1047
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
you know, one class

1048
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and a bunch of builds

1049
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
from all of them.

1050
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Aislinn, I think,

1051
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
what better thing

1052
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
to get into now

1053
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
than tell us about the Armory?

1054
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Oh, yeah,

1055
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I would love to.

1056
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah.

1057
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So for those who don't know,

1058
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
the Armory is a tool

1059
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
that you can use

1060
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
to basically save a loadout

1061
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,000
that you've constructed.

1062
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
So you're going to be able

1063
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
to save your skills

1064
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that you've picked.

1065
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You're going to be able

1066
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
to save the equipment

1067
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,000
you've used.

1068
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You're going to be able

1069
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
to save the Paragon points

1070
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,000
you've put in.

1071
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And you're going to be able

1072
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
to imprint it onto

1073
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,000
one of these slots

1074
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
in the Armory you see

1075
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
on the left here

1076
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,000
in this image.

1077
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Like, this character

1078
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
has Crush Hand,

1079
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Touch of Death,

1080
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,000
or Touch Death,

1081
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Quill, Razor Wings,

1082
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and Payback.

1083
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
So, you know,

1084
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
this is a Spiritborn

1085
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
that has saved a bunch

1086
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,000
of different builds there.

1087
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
It's really wonderful

1088
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
because, you know,

1089
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
if you want to try

1090
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
a different build,

1091
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
like if you want to try

1092
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Touch of Death,

1093
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,000
but you've spent

1094
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
a really long time

1095
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
working on Crushing Hand,

1096
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
you don't have to worry

1097
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
about changing all of that

1098
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
manually anymore

1099
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,000
with the Armory.

1100
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,000
You can just do it

1101
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
automatically.

1102
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Once you've created

1103
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
that build,

1104
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,000
you save it,

1105
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
and then you can swap

1106
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
to it whenever you want.

1107
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
These loadout slots

1108
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
are also character bound.

1109
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So, you know,

1110
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
you make a Spiritborn,

1111
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,000
and then you decide

1112
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
you later want to swap

1113
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
to a Necro or,

1114
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,000
you know, whatever.

1115
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
You're going to be able

1116
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
to ensure that you have

1117
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
a lot of variety

1118
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
to play in each character class.

1119
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Another thing about loadouts

1120
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
is that they don't

1121
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
cause gold to change,

1122
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
so you're not going to have

1123
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
a bunch of significant

1124
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
gold overhead

1125
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
when you're actually

1126
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
swapping these,

1127
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
so you don't have to worry

1128
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,000
about that at all,

1129
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
which is very nice.

1130
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And the Armory

1131
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,000
can be accessed

1132
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
through a bunch of

1133
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
different places

1134
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
in Sanctuary as well,

1135
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
including Major Cities,

1136
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
the Dark Citadel,

1137
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,000
the Tree of Whispers,

1138
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
of course,

1139
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,000
which is a major

1140
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
focal point of Season 7,

1141
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
and training areas,

1142
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
so that if you're trying

1143
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
to test certain things,

1144
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
you can really easily

1145
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
make adjustments

1146
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
without having to,

1147
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
you know,

1148
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
spend a lot of time on that.

1149
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And finally,

1150
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
we've got a few PTR updates

1151
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
where we gathered feedback

1152
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
from the PTR.

1153
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
We have improved

1154
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
the button clarity

1155
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
from the PTR.

1156
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
If you see in the image,

1157
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
the little highlighted

1158
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
white box section,

1159
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
that should be more clear

1160
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
than it was in the PTR.

1161
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And we heard you guys

1162
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
about easier loadout deletion.

1163
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,000
We're going to make sure

1164
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
that that is much easier

1165
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
to do in 2.11.

1166
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And next up,

1167
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
we have some gameplay updates.

1168
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
So these are just

1169
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
some miscellaneous things

1170
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
that are coming in Season 7

1171
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
related to systemic gameplay.

1172
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So I'll just go through

1173
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,000
these one by one here.

1174
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
We have Paragon Migration.

1175
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So any experience

1176
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
that you earn

1177
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
on your Paragon levels

1178
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
in the Seasonal Realm,

1179
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
once the season is over,

1180
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
are going to be added

1181
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
to your Eternal Realm season,

1182
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
rather,

1183
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
your Eternal Realm Paragon level.

1184
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,000
So if you earn

1185
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
a bunch of Paragon XP

1186
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
in Season 6,

1187
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and then Season 6 ends,

1188
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
all of that Paragon XP

1189
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
is going to be added

1190
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
to your Eternal Paragon level,

1191
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
which is going to make

1192
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
reaching Paragon level 300

1193
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
a lot more attainable

1194
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
for a lot of folks

1195
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
on the Eternal Realm,

1196
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,000
which is pretty cool.

1197
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah, you just get progress

1198
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
every season over season

1199
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
on your Eternal Realm Paragon

1200
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,000
to make sure you can

1201
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
really reach the heights of that,

1202
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
even if you're just

1203
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,000
a seasonal player

1204
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
for the most part.

1205
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
When you hop into Eternal Realm,

1206
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
all of that progress

1207
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
is going to be carried over.

1208
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah, and it's actually

1209
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
going to be really nice

1210
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
because I think the way

1211
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I like to think about it

1212
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
is even if you don't play

1213
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
on the Eternal Realm,

1214
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
it's kind of like a window

1215
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
into how much you've played

1216
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,000
the game

1217
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and how much effort

1218
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,000
you've put in,

1219
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
and you get to look

1220
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
at that number

1221
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,000
and be like,

1222
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
oh, that just gets higher

1223
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
and higher.

1224
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It's great.

1225
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Next up, we have

1226
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
some unique power roll updates.

1227
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
So something that you might notice

1228
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
when you are finding unique items

1229
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
is that if they roll Ancestral

1230
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and they drop with greater affixes,

1231
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
that doesn't affect

1232
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
the actual unique power roll

1233
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
itself in any way.

1234
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So it was possible

1235
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
to find, for example,

1236
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
a three or four greater affix unique,

1237
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
but then the actual power roll itself

1238
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
min rolled.

1239
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And that could feel

1240
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,000
pretty deflating.

1241
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Oh, yeah.

1242
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Because you would get really excited

1243
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
that you found a unique

1244
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
that you wanted

1245
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
that had all the GAs

1246
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
and then you look

1247
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
and it doesn't actually

1248
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
feel very usable

1249
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
because the power roll itself

1250
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
was very low.

1251
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
We're changing this

1252
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
in Season 7.

1253
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So now,

1254
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
the power roll floor

1255
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
changes based on the number

1256
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
of greater affixes

1257
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
that the unique has.

1258
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
So the more greater affixes

1259
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
it has,

1260
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
the higher guaranteed roll

1261
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
on the unique power

1262
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,000
you're going to get.

1263
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So when you do see

1264
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
that three or four greater

1265
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
affix unique you want,

1266
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
you know it's going

1267
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
to absolutely slap,

1268
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,000
which is awesome.

1269
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Yeah, definitely.

1270
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That was always a little bit

1271
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
of a frustrating experience

1272
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
when you get really excited

1273
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
for an item drop

1274
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,000
but then you're like,

1275
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
well,

1276
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
is it really better

1277
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
than what I currently have?

1278
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You know,

1279
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
you had to start,

1280
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
stop and think about that

1281
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
based on the affixes

1282
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and the unique power roll.

1283
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But now,

1284
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
if you get a three or four GA,

1285
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,000
hey,

1286
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
you know it's going

1287
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
to be powerful.

1288
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It may not be guaranteed

1289
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
to be the best one

1290
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
but it's going to be

1291
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
one of the more powerful rolls.

1292
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1293
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And next up,

1294
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
we have some other

1295
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
ancestral item changes.

1296
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So something you may have noticed

1297
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
if you were playing

1298
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
a lot of Season 6

1299
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
is that ancestral items

1300
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
are the only ones

1301
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,000
that can have

1302
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
the top aspect rolls.

1303
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And what that meant

1304
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,000
was that

1305
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
those ancestral items

1306
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
were still rolling randomly.

1307
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
So like,

1308
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,000
let's just say

1309
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
for the sake of argument

1310
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
that a non-ancestral item

1311
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
with an aspect

1312
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
could roll up to rank 8

1313
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
on that aspect.

1314
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
But then the ancestral version

1315
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
could roll up to rank 11.

1316
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
That ancestral item

1317
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
was still randomly,

1318
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
like totally randomly rolling

1319
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
among all the different ranks.

1320
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And that made it seem

1321
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
really,

1322
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,000
really,

1323
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,000
really,

1324
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
what didn't seem,

1325
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
it was,

1326
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
it was very rare

1327
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
to find the top end

1328
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
of these aspect rolls

1329
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
which actually wasn't the case

1330
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
in previous seasons.

1331
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And we were all feeling

1332
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
that in Season 6.

1333
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And for the completionists

1334
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
out there

1335
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,000
and the people

1336
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
who want to make sure

1337
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,000
that they have

1338
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
the best version

1339
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,000
of the aspects

1340
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
that they can,

1341
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
we wanted to make sure

1342
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
that we changed that.

1343
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So now when you find

1344
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
these ancestral items,

1345
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
they are going to gravitate

1346
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
more towards the top end

1347
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
of those aspect rolls.

1348
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And it should be much easier

1349
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
to actually fill out

1350
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
your collection of aspects

1351
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
than it was before

1352
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,000
in Season 6.

1353
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And then as just

1354
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,000
a totally separate

1355
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
but wonderful thing,

1356
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
we were working on

1357
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
like how often

1358
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
ancestral items

1359
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
should actually drop

1360
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,000
as a baseline.

1361
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And we've just bumped

1362
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
that up in Season 7.

1363
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So you should,

1364
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,000
in general,

1365
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
find more ancestral items

1366
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
than you did before.

1367
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And this is like

1368
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
a very,

1369
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
something that feels

1370
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,000
very small

1371
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
but has a big impact

1372
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,000
on the season

1373
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
as a whole.

1374
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So that should feel

1375
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,000
a lot better

1376
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
in Season 7 as well.

1377
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And finally,

1378
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,000
something else

1379
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
that we were noticing

1380
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,000
in Season 6

1381
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
was that people

1382
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
were finding

1383
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
tons and tons

1384
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
of gem fragments

1385
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,000
and sometimes

1386
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
even capping out

1387
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
their gem fragments

1388
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
if you've played enough.

1389
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And this problem

1390
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,000
was exacerbated

1391
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
in Season 6

1392
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and we want to make sure

1393
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
that you have something

1394
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
to do with those

1395
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
gem fragments.

1396
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So we created

1397
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
a gem fragment conversion

1398
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
at the Jewel Crafter.

1399
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So we have a little clip

1400
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
to just show

1401
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
what that looks like here.

1402
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
So we're in Zarbenzed

1403
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
as a sorcerer

1404
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
and we're next to the jeweler.

1405
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
We're going to talk to them.

1406
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
There's a little tab

1407
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,000
where you can go

1408
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
to Jewelry Crafting.

1409
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And once you're

1410
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
in the late game

1411
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,000
and you've already crafted

1412
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
all your grand gems

1413
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
and you don't actually

1414
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
have much to do

1415
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
with your gem fragments anymore,

1416
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
now you can just

1417
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
directly convert them

1418
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
into jewelry.

1419
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
So you can craft rings

1420
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
and you can craft amulets

1421
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
and it will give you

1422
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
a little cash

1423
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,000
that will have

1424
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
a randomly rolled item.

1425
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And this is just,

1426
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
again, you know,

1427
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
it's a nice dump basically

1428
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
once you want to just,

1429
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
once you finish

1430
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
all your grand gems

1431
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
and you just want to

1432
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,000
find some extra gear.

1433
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And these can roll

1434
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
as ancestral items,

1435
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
which is wonderful.

1436
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And amulets and rings

1437
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
can, you know,

1438
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
they have a wide range

1439
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
of potentially useful stats.

1440
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
And so being able

1441
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
to just roll those more

1442
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
is really nice

1443
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,000
because you can actually

1444
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
target farm the things

1445
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
you need.

1446
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Absolutely.

1447
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Yeah.

1448
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Yeah.

1449
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Really excited for that.

1450
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Yep, for sure.

1451
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And finally,

1452
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
we have some

1453
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
kind of more quality

1454
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
of life centered

1455
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
or early game updates

1456
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
that should be really nice

1457
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
going forward

1458
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
season over season.

1459
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,000
season.

1460
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So now that we're

1461
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
in season seven

1462
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
of Diablo 4,

1463
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
it's possible

1464
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,000
that you may have

1465
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
made a character

1466
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
of any given class

1467
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
and you might be

1468
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,000
doing it again.

1469
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And it's not always

1470
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
the most fun

1471
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
to go through

1472
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
the same content

1473
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
over and over.

1474
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And so because of that,

1475
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
we wanted to make sure

1476
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
that you didn't actually

1477
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,000
have to do

1478
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
your class quest

1479
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
to unlock

1480
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,000
your class mechanic

1481
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
every single time

1482
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
you make a new character.

1483
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
So for example,

1484
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
if you made a sorcerer

1485
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
and you unlocked

1486
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
enchantments previously,

1487
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
you're not actually

1488
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,000
going to have to

1489
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
do that again.

1490
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So when you hit

1491
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
level 15 on a new sorcerer

1492
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
in any realm,

1493
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
you're immediately

1494
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
going to unlock

1495
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
an enchantment slot

1496
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
because the game knows

1497
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,000
that you already

1498
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
did that before.

1499
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
You can, however,

1500
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
still do the class quest

1501
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
if you would like,

1502
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
but you do not have to.

1503
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And again,

1504
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
just to reiterate,

1505
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
you do have to do

1506
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
the class quest

1507
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
at least once

1508
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
on any character

1509
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
and then on your account,

1510
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
it's unlocked forever.

1511
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And to go along

1512
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
with this change,

1513
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
we have a new cache

1514
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
that we like to call

1515
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
archetype cache

1516
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
or archetype caches rather.

1517
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So these are basically

1518
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
themed goodie bags.

1519
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
So they come from

1520
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
a variety of sources.

1521
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,000
You're going to get

1522
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
an archetype cache

1523
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
when you complete

1524
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
the class quest.

1525
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You're going to get them

1526
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
periodically over the

1527
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
course of the season journey

1528
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
from different chapters.

1529
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And then eventually

1530
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,000
you're going to start

1531
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
earning greater archetype

1532
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
caches as well,

1533
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
which have better stuff.

1534
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
But we have a clip here

1535
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
to basically just show off

1536
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
what an archetype cache

1537
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
looks like

1538
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,000
and what doing your

1539
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
class quest looks like

1540
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
in season seven.

1541
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So we have a level 15

1542
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,000
sorcerer here

1543
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
who's just going to go

1544
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
and do their class quest,

1545
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,000
which is the legacy

1546
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
of the Magi over here.

1547
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And the reason

1548
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
that this character

1549
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
might want to do

1550
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
the class quest still,

1551
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
even though let's assume

1552
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
that they have already

1553
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
made a sorcerer

1554
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,000
and have already

1555
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
unlocked their enchantment,

1556
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
is because they're going

1557
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,000
to be getting

1558
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
an archetype cache.

1559
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So we're going to go through,

1560
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
we're just going to do

1561
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
all of the stuff

1562
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
for Legacy of the Magi,

1563
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
get through the dungeon.

1564
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
But then at the end,

1565
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,000
we're going to get

1566
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
an archetype cache.

1567
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
And archetype caches

1568
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
have items

1569
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
and a tempering manual

1570
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
that are relevant

1571
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
to a specific theme

1572
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
of any given class.

1573
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And so I'm glad

1574
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,000
we have sorcerer here

1575
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
because the sorcerer themes

1576
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
are very straightforward.

1577
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,000
For example,

1578
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
pyromancy or fire

1579
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
is one of the themes

1580
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
in sorcerer.

1581
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
So here we see

1582
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
we have a pyromancy cache

1583
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
that we got from completing

1584
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
the class quest.

1585
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
We're going to open it up.

1586
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
It's got two legendary items,

1587
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
a tempering manual,

1588
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
and some extra materials

1589
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
like bundled herbs

1590
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
and angel breath,

1591
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and et cetera.

1592
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Because it was a pyromancy cache,

1593
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
it came with a utility

1594
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
and a more offensive-focused

1595
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,000
legendary

1596
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
that are related

1597
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
to being a pyromancy sorcerer.

1598
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It also came with

1599
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
a pyromancy-related

1600
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
tempering manual.

1601
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So that really helps you

1602
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
get started on your journey

1603
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
as like a fire sorcerer.

1604
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So if you find something like that,

1605
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
you're right out of the gate

1606
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:46,000
at level 15,

1607
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
you're going to get

1608
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
a big jump in power,

1609
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
and you're going to be able

1610
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
to dive into like

1611
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
what it means to be

1612
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
a fire sorcerer

1613
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,000
pretty quickly.

1614
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah, I think what I really like

1615
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
about this change

1616
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
is that, you know,

1617
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
if you're just playing

1618
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,000
a new character,

1619
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
you're in the flow,

1620
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
you're doing the head hunts,

1621
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,000
you're leveling up,

1622
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
you ding,

1623
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
hit level 15, right?

1624
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
You think,

1625
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
oh, now I've got to go

1626
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
do this quest,

1627
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,000
otherwise I'm missing out

1628
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
on power.

1629
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And sometimes, you know,

1630
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
you're in that flow.

1631
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
You don't want to stop

1632
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,000
and change,

1633
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,000
shift gears,

1634
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
and go do that class quest.

1635
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
You now can do it

1636
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
on your own time, right?

1637
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
You can instantly unlock

1638
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
that power

1639
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
from the class mechanic,

1640
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
and then whenever

1641
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
you get a chance,

1642
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,000
whenever you think,

1643
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
hey, I want to go

1644
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,000
do this quest,

1645
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,000
you can go do it

1646
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
and then feel rewarded

1647
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
for getting a nice

1648
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
archetype cache

1649
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
that really maybe

1650
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
pushes you in a certain direction

1651
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,000
if you're unsure

1652
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
of how you want to

1653
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,000
build your character,

1654
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,000
can help to enhance,

1655
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
you know,

1656
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,000
the pyromancy,

1657
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
like you mentioned.

1658
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Yep, or frost,

1659
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
or lightning,

1660
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,000
or, you know,

1661
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
every class has its own themes,

1662
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
so it's going to be fun

1663
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
to dig into that.

1664
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Cool.

1665
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,000
All right.

1666
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,000
That's awesome.

1667
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah, I think even

1668
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
for that early game too,

1669
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
when you're kind of

1670
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
scrounging for materials

1671
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,000
and uniques,

1672
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,000
it is kind of difficult

1673
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
to hit that next power level,

1674
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
so knowing that you have

1675
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
a guaranteed,

1676
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
now optional,

1677
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
quest to go to

1678
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
to get that power in.

1679
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I can speak for Twitch that too.

1680
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
They were very, very excited

1681
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
to see that you did

1682
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
not have to do

1683
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
the class quest anymore,

1684
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
but that it gives you

1685
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
this optional power boost

1686
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
in a certain direction.

1687
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
We wanted to make sure

1688
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
that it wasn't worthless

1689
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
if you had already done it a lot.

1690
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
We wanted to make sure

1691
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,000
that there was still

1692
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
something there

1693
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
to feel like

1694
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
it was a meaningful quest.

1695
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Yeah, but not so good

1696
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
that you feel like

1697
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
you're missing out

1698
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
if you're...

1699
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Exactly.

1700
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Taking care of things

1701
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
over in the headhunts

1702
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and things like that.

1703
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Yep.

1704
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Well, that brings us

1705
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
to our Q&A portion of the stream.

1706
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,000
So we're going to bring

1707
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Dan Tangway back

1708
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
and we're going to answer

1709
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
some of your hard-hitting questions.

1710
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
So thank you for everyone

1711
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
who dropped questions

1712
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
in Twitch chat

1713
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
throughout the stream.

1714
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I've also been laughing

1715
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
at your commentary throughout.

1716
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It's been pretty good.

1717
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
So first off,

1718
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I want to drop a question

1719
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
from Doggo.

1720
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Asked,

1721
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
will there be a mid-season patch

1722
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
with balance changes?

1723
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Yeah, I can talk about that.

1724
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
We are currently planning

1725
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
to have a mid-season

1726
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,000
balance patch

1727
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
like we do every season.

1728
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I just want to reiterate

1729
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,000
some of the philosophy

1730
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
around mid-season patches

1731
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
as well.

1732
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
For our mid-season patches,

1733
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
we're mainly looking

1734
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
at taking the data

1735
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
from when the season launches.

1736
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
So honestly,

1737
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
we haven't started looking

1738
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
at the mid-season patch at all

1739
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
because it's so heavily driven

1740
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
by what actually happens

1741
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
when the season launches.

1742
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
What builds are performing well?

1743
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
What builds are not performing well?

1744
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
If there's anything

1745
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
that is bugged

1746
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
or broken to the point

1747
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
where it's trivializing the game,

1748
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,000
that might be something

1749
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
we look at.

1750
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,000
In general,

1751
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
for mid-season patches

1752
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
that happen,

1753
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,000
well,

1754
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
in the middle of the season,

1755
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
we're primarily looking

1756
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
to bring up

1757
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
the underperformers

1758
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
or fix issues

1759
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
of interactions

1760
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
that maybe aren't

1761
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
quite seeing the spotlight

1762
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
that we were expecting them to.

1763
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
We're not really looking

1764
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
to take the top builds

1765
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
and nerf them.

1766
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Right.

1767
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Because we know players

1768
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
have already had time

1769
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
to invest in their characters.

1770
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
They've got the gear.

1771
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
They've leveled it up.

1772
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
They've read build guides

1773
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,000
like,

1774
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,000
hey,

1775
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
how do I make this character?

1776
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
And we feel like

1777
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
if we're taking those down

1778
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
in the middle of a season,

1779
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
that really does a disservice

1780
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
to players

1781
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
that you are afraid

1782
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
of making the powerful thing

1783
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
because it might get nerfed

1784
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
in the mid-season.

1785
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So that's something we avoid.

1786
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
There are, of course,

1787
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
sometimes rare exceptions

1788
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
when they're so far above

1789
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
our power bar

1790
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
or they are literally

1791
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
breaking the game

1792
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
due to performance-related issues

1793
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
which occasionally pop up.

1794
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Those things we still

1795
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
will address

1796
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
when we need to.

1797
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
But in general,

1798
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
mid-season patches

1799
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
are not for nerfing

1800
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
strong builds

1801
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
if they are just strong.

1802
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And that's partly why

1803
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,000
during Season 6

1804
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
we knew that, you know,

1805
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Spiritborn was

1806
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
a very powerful class.

1807
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Like, no kidding around it.

1808
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
It was definitely stronger

1809
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
than the other classes

1810
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
on Season 6.

1811
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
But that was okay.

1812
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
We didn't want to make

1813
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
any kind of

1814
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
snap judgment of like,

1815
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
oh, we need to nerf it

1816
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
here in mid-season.

1817
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
We know players

1818
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
have been invested into it

1819
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
and we want to respect

1820
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
their time and investment

1821
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,000
into that.

1822
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,000
It's important that there's

1823
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
a sense of security

1824
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
in picking a build

1825
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and knowing that it is

1826
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
going to stay viable

1827
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
when you're playing it

1828
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,000
throughout the season.

1829
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Yeah, and kind of

1830
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
as a corollary to that,

1831
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
whenever we do

1832
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
seasonal updates

1833
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
like launch a brand new season,

1834
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
that is more

1835
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
when we're going to look

1836
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and say, hey,

1837
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
what is dramatically

1838
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
overperforming?

1839
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
What is crowding out

1840
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
the rest of the roster?

1841
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Like Spiritborn

1842
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
during Season 6

1843
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
was maybe crowding out

1844
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
some of the other classes.

1845
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
We take the seasonal resets

1846
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
as a time to say,

1847
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
that's when we're going

1848
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
to bring those builds down

1849
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
and that's when everyone

1850
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
is starting fresh

1851
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:21,000
on the new season

1852
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
and so you're not losing

1853
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
that much of time investment

1854
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
if it's starting

1855
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
all fresh again.

1856
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Yeah, and on the system side

1857
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
in terms of mid-season changes,

1858
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
it's really important to us

1859
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
that we have a very targeted approach

1860
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
to systemic changes

1861
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
in mid-season patches.

1862
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:37,000
We want to make sure

1863
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
that we are gathering

1864
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
as much data as possible

1865
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
and as much information

1866
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,000
as we can

1867
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
to ensure that any tweaks

1868
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
we make aren't going

1869
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
to cause waves

1870
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
or changes

1871
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
that we weren't expecting

1872
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
or undesirable.

1873
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So we really want to gather

1874
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
as much telemetry

1875
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
and data as possible

1876
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
from how people

1877
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
are actually experiencing

1878
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,000
this season

1879
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
and then kind of patch

1880
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
those pain points

1881
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
that we all find together

1882
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and we want to wait

1883
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,000
to make sure

1884
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
that we're doing it right.

1885
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
So we really want to know

1886
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
how people are going

1887
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,000
to be playing

1888
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Season of the Witchcraft

1889
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
and then we'll basically

1890
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
figure out

1891
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
what needs to happen

1892
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
and change from there.

1893
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Yeah, and that's why

1894
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
so much of the feedback

1895
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
from PTR

1896
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
or even just throughout

1897
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
the regular seasons,

1898
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
all the feedback,

1899
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
we really do listen to it

1900
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
and it's so important to us

1901
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,000
to make sure

1902
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
that we can make

1903
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Diablo 4 as best

1904
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
as we possibly can.

1905
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
It's really critical

1906
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,000
that we get that feedback

1907
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
and we're able

1908
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
to iterate on that.

1909
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Absolutely.

1910
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Awesome.

1911
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
That is a super thorough answer

1912
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
for the mid-season patch.

1913
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I mean, like,

1914
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I'll take all the information

1915
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
you got,

1916
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
so that's fantastic.

1917
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
This one's probably

1918
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
for you, Aislinn,

1919
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
from, oh boy, okay,

1920
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
bear with me here.

1921
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Pap, Pap, Surup, Sagan,

1922
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
do the Class Quest caches

1923
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
scale to the level

1924
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
when they're opened?

1925
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Oh, yes,

1926
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,000
they absolutely do.

1927
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So you can get it early

1928
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
or you can get it later,

1929
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
but the archetype caches

1930
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,000
that you find

1931
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
in the Class Quest

1932
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
aren't actually the only place

1933
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
you can find archetype caches.

1934
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
You're going to be able

1935
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
to get more from

1936
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,000
the season journey

1937
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
and other sources as well.

1938
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So they're not exactly,

1939
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
like, a super finite supply,

1940
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
so you don't have to think

1941
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
too hard about, like,

1942
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
exactly when you should

1943
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
be opening them.

1944
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:20,000
The Class Quest

1945
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
is just one among

1946
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
many sources

1947
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
that you can earn

1948
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
in archetype cache.

1949
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So you don't have to, like,

1950
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
sit on it throughout

1951
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
the whole season

1952
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,000
to be like,

1953
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,000
all right,

1954
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
when am I going to pop

1955
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,000
this thing?

1956
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Yeah.

1957
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And nice to have

1958
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:29,000
some extra goodies

1959
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
as you're on your way

1960
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
to get a Dorian the Raven.

1961
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Of course.

1962
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Because we know

1963
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
that's the most important thing.

1964
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I mean,

1965
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I don't want to say,

1966
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
but Dorian's pretty cool.

1967
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Also, on a similar thread,

1968
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
the Collector Casey asks,

1969
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
is the Class Quest unlock

1970
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
retroactive

1971
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
as of right now

1972
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
or only after

1973
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
we complete it

1974
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
this season?

1975
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Yeah, so as long,

1976
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,000
it's retroactive.

1977
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
So as long as

1978
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
you've completed,

1979
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,000
you know,

1980
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,000
you've done

1981
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
the Sorcerer quest before

1982
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,000
on a Sorcerer

1983
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
at any point during Diablo,

1984
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,000
you're good to go.

1985
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Nice.

1986
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
From the Discord,

1987
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Bacterial,

1988
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
cool name,

1989
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
can we expect

1990
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
the summon tag

1991
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,000
to work with

1992
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
minion thorns

1993
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
and any update

1994
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
on Bristleback aspect

1995
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
working with minions?

1996
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I believe they should.

1997
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I'd have to look

1998
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,000
into precisely

1999
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
minion thorns.

2000
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I know that was

2001
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
a stat that,

2002
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:19,000
you know,

2003
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
your summons

2004
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
can inherit your thorns.

2005
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
That was a stat

2006
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
that I,

2007
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
hmm,

2008
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I'd have to look

2009
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
into exactly

2010
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Bristleback aspect,

2011
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
but as a general matter,

2012
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
our philosophy

2013
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
on minion thorns

2014
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
and minions

2015
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
in general

2016
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
is if you think

2017
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,000
it should work,

2018
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
it should.

2019
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
The interactions

2020
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
of when you deal

2021
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
thorns damage,

2022
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
it should,

2023
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,000
if your minions

2024
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
are the ones

2025
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
triggering that thorns damage,

2026
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
it should count

2027
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
as if you had dealt it.

2028
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I don't have that

2029
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
right in front of me,

2030
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
that particular interaction,

2031
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
but that is our philosophy

2032
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
and if that's not happening,

2033
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,000
then we'll look

2034
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
to address it

2035
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
and improve that

2036
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,000
moving forward.

2037
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Cool.

2038
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Thank you.

2039
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I just had a question

2040
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,000
from

2041
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
AoE Alina.

2042
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Are there plans

2043
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
to reduce visual clutter

2044
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
such as an opacity slider?

2045
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I love Sorcerer

2046
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
and Spiritborn,

2047
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
but the visual effects

2048
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
are hindering my party.

2049
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I think that would

2050
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
probably be something

2051
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
that we would have

2052
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
to talk to the UI team

2053
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
about and the folks

2054
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
over in VFX.

2055
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It's something

2056
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
that we've been grappling

2057
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,000
with throughout

2058
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
the life of Diablo

2059
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
because, you know,

2060
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
there's so much happening,

2061
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
especially when you have

2062
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
an endgame build.

2063
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And, you know,

2064
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
if that gets so out of hand

2065
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
with new seasonal mechanics

2066
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
or new powers

2067
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
or legendary aspects

2068
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
that we create,

2069
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
it's something

2070
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
that we'll be taking a look at

2071
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
every time something

2072
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
like that comes up.

2073
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Yeah.

2074
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I totally get it too

2075
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,000
because when you're

2076
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
playing Spiritborn,

2077
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
you know what to look for

2078
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,000
as you're casting

2079
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
these abilities,

2080
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
but if you're just around it,

2081
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
then it can be

2082
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
a little overwhelming.

2083
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Like when I have friends

2084
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,000
that come by

2085
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
that perhaps haven't played

2086
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
a Diablo game before,

2087
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
they're like,

2088
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,000
how do you know

2089
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,000
what to look at?

2090
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
It's like you just

2091
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
kind of figure it out.

2092
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
But I can totally see

2093
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
how that could be

2094
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
a bit of a distraction

2095
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
on the screen.

2096
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Ooh, Anjinsan.

2097
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
For the Q&A,

2098
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
how do hydras work

2099
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
with the new summoning changes

2100
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
and how does burning damage

2101
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
work in comparison to poison?

2102
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Yeah.

2103
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Another very technical question

2104
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,000
for you, Charles.

2105
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So luckily,

2106
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,000
you know,

2107
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I did include

2108
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
the Sorcerer Conjurations

2109
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
in the summons update

2110
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
when I talked about them.

2111
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Yeah.

2112
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,000
But actually,

2113
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
for the most part,

2114
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
the Conjurations

2115
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
were already behaving this way.

2116
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And that was part

2117
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
of the inconsistency

2118
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
that I kind of

2119
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,000
had glossed over,

2120
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,000
said, hey,

2121
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
they were inconsistent.

2122
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And, you know,

2123
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,000
since now we're

2124
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
in the more technical part,

2125
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
the inconsistency was that

2126
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
most of the Sorcerer Conjurations

2127
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
were already behaving

2128
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
the way that we wanted them to.

2129
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Right.

2130
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Where the damage

2131
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
was being attributed

2132
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
to the player,

2133
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
and it was actually

2134
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
the Necro minions

2135
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
and Shadow Clone

2136
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
and Druid Companions

2137
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
primarily that were

2138
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
not as interactive

2139
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
as we would have liked.

2140
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Right.

2141
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
So with that in mind,

2142
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,000
there's actually

2143
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
no real functional changes

2144
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,000
to the way

2145
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
that Hydra works with this.

2146
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I don't believe Hydra

2147
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,000
was really touched,

2148
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
but it was actually used

2149
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
as kind of the example

2150
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
of how we wanted

2151
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,000
to implement

2152
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
and make the other summons work.

2153
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
One question I do want

2154
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
to take really quickly

2155
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
that I've seen throughout chat,

2156
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I mean,

2157
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
it was really hard to ignore.

2158
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,000
People are asking

2159
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
where Adam was.

2160
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I mean,

2161
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I think we just have

2162
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
to address it straight up.

2163
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Adam Fletcher

2164
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
is no longer with Blizzard,

2165
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
which is really too bad.

2166
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So you won't really

2167
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,000
be seeing him

2168
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
in a whole lot

2169
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:27,000
of other streams.

2170
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So really sorry

2171
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
to disappoint chat,

2172
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,000
but you're stuck with him.

2173
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Just kidding.

2174
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
He's been here

2175
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
the whole time.

2176
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Oh my God.

2177
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Just kidding.

2178
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Just kidding.

2179
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Adam's staying forever.

2180
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Is Adam in the room

2181
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
with us right now?

2182
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,000
He has been here

2183
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
the whole time.

2184
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Yeah,

2185
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,000
yeah.

2186
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
To be clear,

2187
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Adam has literally sat

2188
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
two feet to the left

2189
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
this entire time

2190
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
just like for the whole stream.

2191
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Just hanging out,

2192
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,000
checking out,

2193
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,000
watching chat.

2194
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
So yeah,

2195
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Adam,

2196
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Adam is here to stay.

2197
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Do not worry.

2198
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
All right.

2199
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
All right.

2200
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Love from Judith.

2201
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Stash space is already

2202
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
a problem for anyone

2203
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
running multiple characters.

2204
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Are there any plans

2205
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
to change armory loadouts

2206
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,000
so that they will not

2207
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
be stored in stash?

2208
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
You know,

2209
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
it's something,

2210
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
the armory is very new.

2211
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
We knew that the community

2212
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
really,

2213
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
really wanted the armory

2214
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
and so we wanted to

2215
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
get out a version of it

2216
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,000
that we,

2217
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,000
you know,

2218
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
was serviceable

2219
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
to get started.

2220
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
But we know it's a really,

2221
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
really important topic

2222
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,000
for the community.

2223
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So it's something

2224
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
that we're going to

2225
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
continuously look at

2226
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
and we're going to be

2227
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
looking a lot at feedback

2228
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,000
on the armory

2229
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
to make sure that it's

2230
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
as smooth as possible

2231
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
all the time.

2232
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And to that end,

2233
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
you know,

2234
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
we will be taking

2235
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
that into consideration.

2236
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
No concrete plans

2237
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,000
right now,

2238
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
but it's something,

2239
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,000
you know,

2240
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
it's one of the topics

2241
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
that we have.

2242
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And our,

2243
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:45,000
again,

2244
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
our ultimate goal

2245
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
is to make the armory

2246
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
just basically

2247
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
the most streamlined

2248
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
version of itself

2249
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
that it can be.

2250
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
So look for armory

2251
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
improvements in the future

2252
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:55,000
for sure.

2253
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Awesome.

2254
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Cool.

2255
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
And we got our last

2256
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
question from the Q&A.

2257
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
This is actually a two-parter

2258
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,000
for both of you.

2259
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
We have Poseidon Bobby

2260
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
was asking Charles,

2261
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
does your shirt

2262
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
glow in the dark?

2263
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:06,000
You know,

2264
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I haven't tried,

2265
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
but it looks like it might.

2266
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,000
It looks like it might.

2267
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It looks like it should.

2268
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
At least if you might

2269
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
glow in the dark bowling

2270
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
for sure would light up.

2271
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I am being told it doesn't

2272
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
and I demand a refund.

2273
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Wow.

2274
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I would like to get

2275
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
a glow in the dark

2276
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Lilith shirt now.

2277
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,000
What a ripoff, man.

2278
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
And then on a similar vein,

2279
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Aislinn,

2280
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Radiobiology was asking,

2281
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
can you buy that sweater?

2282
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Can you buy this wonderful

2283
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
holiday Lilith's

2284
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Christmas sweater?

2285
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I don't know.

2286
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Adam is saying it's sold out.

2287
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,000
It's sold out.

2288
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It's sold out.

2289
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It's sold out for a year.

2290
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Sold out for every year.

2291
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
This is a one-of-a-kind.

2292
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
We did have a different

2293
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
holiday sweater this past year,

2294
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
so there should,

2295
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I mean,

2296
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
hopefully be another

2297
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
holiday sweater next year.

2298
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
No guarantees.

2299
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Yeah.

2300
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:49,000
But yeah,

2301
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
if you do see those

2302
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
holiday sweaters in the shop,

2303
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
get them before they're gone.

2304
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
There's always like

2305
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
really wonderful merch online

2306
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,000
for Diablo.

2307
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I love taking a look at it,

2308
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
so if you like Diablo merch

2309
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
and you want something like this,

2310
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
definitely, you know,

2311
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,000
check it periodically.

2312
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Definitely grab it.

2313
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Well, yeah,

2314
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
that brings us to the end

2315
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
of the stream.

2316
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I want to give a really big

2317
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
thank you to Aislinn,

2318
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Charles,

2319
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Dan Tanguay.

2320
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Thank you so much

2321
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,000
for hanging out with us

2322
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
all the way in snowy

2323
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Albany, New York.

2324
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I hope it's not too

2325
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:15,000
terribly cold.

2326
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Not too bad.

2327
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Okay, okay.

2328
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Glad to hear it.

2329
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I have to say that room

2330
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
looks freezing.

2331
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's like a dungeon.

2332
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
It does look very cold.

2333
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It's a little chilly.

2334
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Yeah.

2335
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
But I got my jacket on.

2336
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I'm all right.

2337
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Good.

2338
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Nice.

2339
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Glad to hear it.

2340
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,000
But yeah,

2341
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
thank you all for joining us

2342
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000

2343
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,000
YouTube,

2344
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,000
TikTok,

2345
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,000
everyone,

2346
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
thank you for staying tuned

2347
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
and checking out

2348
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
everything that's to come

2349
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
with Season of Witchcraft.

2350
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Like we mentioned

2351
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
throughout the stream,

2352
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Patch Notes will be dropping

2353
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
after the stream.

2354
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
We did have our blog

2355
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
that launched on Tuesday

2356
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,000
as well.

2357
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Also,

2358
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I got to give a massive

2359
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
shout out again

2360
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
to our production team.

2361
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
There's a lot of faces

2362
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:48,000
you don't see

2363
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
that put a ton of blood,

2364
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,000
sweat, and tears

2365
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
into the show.

2366
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
These heads are

2367
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
absolutely disgusting

2368
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
and I don't know

2369
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
if anybody needs

2370
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
more of a reason

2371
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
to brush your teeth,

2372
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,000
but you know,

2373
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
don't end up

2374
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
looking like that guy.

2375
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,000
No.

2376
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Season of Witchcraft

2377
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
does start on January 21st

2378
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000

01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
so be sure to go in.

2380
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000

2381
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
who hasn't yet completed

2382
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
your Season Journey,

2383
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
your Battle Pass,

2384
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
check your Seasonal Stash

2385
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
or Eternal Stash as well

2386
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
before those items disappear.

2387
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:17,000
But yeah,

2388
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
we got Season of Witchcraft

2389
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000

2390
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Super excited to get into it.

2391
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Thank you from all of us

2392
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,000

2393
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
and we will see you

2394
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
at the Tree of Whispers.

2395
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Thanks, guys.

2396
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
You're welcome.
