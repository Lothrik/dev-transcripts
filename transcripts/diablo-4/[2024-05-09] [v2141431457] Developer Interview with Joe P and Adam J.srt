1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I wonder if I can show...

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, what's going on, man?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What is up?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What is up?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
All right, can you...

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're doing it.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's happening.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's happening.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Can you guys hear him fine?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Is he fine up or down?

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
How is it sounding, guys?

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Can you talk for a second, Joe?

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Testing the ups and downs.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What's up?

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How do I sound, chat?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can see it's way too low.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to turn you way higher.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's try again.

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I could just start screaming,

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
hey, how do I sound right now?

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, is that better, guys?

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Up more, up more.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, we're going...

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I have you at 100.

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, this is dangerous.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is going to get dangerous

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
when I get excited about something.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So we got to watch out for that.

29
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Apologizing in advance.

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hey, thanks so much for coming on here, man.

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm really excited.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, this is going to be a blast.

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm looking forward to the conversation.

34
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hell yeah.

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Where's my partner in crime?

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Where's Adam Z. Jackson?

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You want to know what?

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He's faking all of these technical issues

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and he's just like,

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
you want to know what?

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm going to call in sick

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and I'm just going to have Joe solo this.

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, it's fine.

44
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's do it.

45
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's just sign him up

46
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
for a whole bunch of stuff.

47
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay, so what I'm going to do here,

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
tried my best to be as prepared as possible.

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Cool.

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But of course,

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm probably not prepared at all.

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So that's just the way life goes.

53
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, no, no, no.

54
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's all good.

55
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hey, and one thing up front,

56
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
right off the top here is like,

57
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have a lot of things I want to say,

58
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but it's okay if you want to interject.

59
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it's not rude.

60
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not going to take it as being rude.

61
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So if there's the things you want to chat through

62
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
or things you want clarification on,

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
like, please, please, please interrupt me.

64
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's all good.

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I feel like I feel like

66
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to give that preface

67
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to everybody I talk to now on stream, right?

68
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I would never interrupt

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
that sweet, angelic, mellow fluous voice.

70
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Speaking of that, Adam Jackson is here.

71
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's take four questions.

72
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Can people hear me okay?

73
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I've spent the last 45 minutes

74
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
troubleshooting my mic

75
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and it's been the worst.

76
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's okay?

77
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Dude, is that a paper towel roller by your bed?

78
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How do I get one of those?

79
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I have kids.

80
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They're very messy.

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's part of the life.

82
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Dude, that is,

83
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that's the most ingenious thing I've ever seen.

84
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We're pretty creative over here.

85
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can hear me okay, though.

86
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm very concerned about this.

87
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's fine.

88
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

89
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank God.

90
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I mean, I can hear you.

91
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Chat, can you hear them?

92
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sounds perfect for me.

93
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How is it for you guys?

94
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
All right, cool.

95
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Because I changed,

96
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I fucked with all my computer settings

97
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and now everything's terrible.

98
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But as long as it works, I'm happy.

99
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
All right.

100
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
All right.

101
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay.

102
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm starting a 40 minute timer.

103
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Then we'll do rapid fire at the end

104
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to try to hit as many as possible.

105
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That sounds good?

106
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sounds good to me.

107
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you so much for being here, guys.

108
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All right.

109
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yesterday, CJ Riker did an interview with them.

110
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So he asked a bunch of great questions.

111
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I want to do some follow-ups

112
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
to some of the questions

113
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that you guys talked about.

114
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So one thing,

115
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
the topic that I think you guys

116
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
probably covered the most

117
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
in the interview yesterday

118
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
at different parts

119
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
was about aspirational

120
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and pinnacle content.

121
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Some of the things that you said

122
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that was uber Lilith

123
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
at the start of the Diablo 4

124
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
was all mechanical mastery.

125
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If you don't dodge the waves,

126
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you're dead.

127
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There's pretty much nothing

128
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
you can do about that.

129
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And a lot of players

130
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
didn't have fun

131
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
just, you know,

132
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
getting crushed by her waves.

133
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's talked about

134
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
there's different lovers

135
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
to pull on the difficulty.

136
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can make players weaker

137
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
like Nightmare Dungeon Sigils.

138
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can make monsters hit harder.

139
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can give them more health,

140
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
more crowd control.

141
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And I heard you say

142
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
that the decisions

143
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
that you make

144
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
before you go into the encounter

145
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
should matter more

146
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
because it's an ARPG.

147
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's about hunting loot.

148
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's about getting powerful.

149
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And then you go in

150
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and you have a big advantage

151
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and you finally overcome

152
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the difficulty.

153
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And another thing

154
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
that I heard you guys say

155
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
is when you guys introduce

156
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
very difficult events

157
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
like the Avatar of Zier,

158
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
for example,

159
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
when you properly advertise it

160
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
as something that's

161
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
very difficult,

162
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
you didn't get any

163
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
negative backlash

164
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
or too much negative backlash

165
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
for the difficulty of it

166
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
because it was properly labeled.

167
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So with that huge preface in mind,

168
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
my question is,

169
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
is do you guys have plans

170
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
in the future of Diablo 4

171
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to build in these very,

172
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
very difficult encounters

173
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
that do require skill,

174
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
that do require you

175
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
to go in with an event

176
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
or with a boss,

177
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
learn their mechanics,

178
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and that is going to be

179
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
another supplement

180
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
besides getting gear

181
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
to winning?

182
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Thoughts on that?

183
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, sure.

184
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I can just kind of,

185
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll start off.

186
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So the,

187
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
so yeah,

188
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
everything we talked about yesterday,

189
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you just did a good job

190
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
of covering again.

191
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I appreciate that.

192
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But when we think about

193
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
what the future

194
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
of aspirational content

195
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
needs to look like in the game,

196
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
we do want to leave opportunities

197
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
for this kind of

198
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
like a mechanically complex content

199
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
for players to engage with.

200
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And we experiment with it

201
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
a few different ways.

202
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I don't think that

203
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
like the Echo Lulith encounter,

204
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
it's a really good example

205
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
of like,

206
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
you know,

207
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
us like diving really,

208
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
really hard into mechanical mastery

209
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
where we expect players

210
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to really have to be

211
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
very,

212
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
very active in terms

213
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
of their dodges

214
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
in order to survive.

215
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But we,

216
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
we do want to continue

217
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
to experiment with these ideas

218
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and try more things,

219
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
particularly when they are advertised

220
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in the appropriate place.

221
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Adam,

222
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
do you have,

223
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
do you have thoughts on this?

224
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

225
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Originally I did

226
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and it was like

227
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
a very long-winded answer,

228
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
but I don't want to

229
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
take up too much time on this.

230
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I guess what I'll say is,

231
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you know,

232
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
everything kind of exists

233
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
on a spectrum

234
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
when we're talking about

235
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
things like difficulty

236
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
or a lot of game design

237
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
topics and ideas.

238
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Like in this spectrum,

239
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
in my mind,

240
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
it's like,

241
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
you know,

242
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
how hard should the thing be

243
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
versus how,

244
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
how much should your gear

245
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
going into it matter?

246
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Right.

247
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think we're still

248
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
trying to find out

249
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
what the best answer is

250
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
for the things

251
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
that are really,

252
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
really hard,

253
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
like Uber Lilith

254
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
or these crazy,

255
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
difficult fights.

256
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
One of the things

257
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that we're doing

258
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
in season four

259
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that we started doing

260
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
in Beyond

261
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that one of our

262
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
encounter designers

263
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
came up with a great idea

264
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
was adding this,

265
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think you've probably

266
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
seen our Ray Racks,

267
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
but that second debuff idea

268
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
where,

269
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you know,

270
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you can screw up

271
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
getting hit by a wave

272
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
a couple times,

273
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
but then after that

274
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you're probably just

275
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
going to get one shot

276
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and die.

277
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And so that gives us

278
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
this kind of happy medium

279
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
between pure one shot mechanics

280
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and things where you have

281
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
to be perfect

282
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
in your dexterity

283
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
versus,

284
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
you know,

285
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the other way

286
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
where you can just

287
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
like outgear everything.

288
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's some other things

289
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
that can go into

290
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
of like,

291
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you know,

292
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
the difference of

293
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
the most powerful

294
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and least power

295
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
or mid powerful builds

296
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and how we do difficulty.

297
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Maybe we'll give that

298
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
a different answer,

299
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
but that's the TLDR.

300
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think we're still

301
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
trying to figure out

302
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
what is best for our game

303
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and what our players like.

304
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You know,

305
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
in my heart of hearts,

306
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm more like you, Racks.

307
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I love the very,

308
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
very crazy hard things.

309
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't mind one shots

310
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
personally.

311
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
In my games,

312
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
but I don't think

313
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
it's best for this game.

314
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

315
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's not millennia.

316
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We have play it.

317
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah.

318
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't think that

319
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
it's best long term,

320
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but having a little bit

321
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
of that kind of stuff

322
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
sometimes I think is okay.

323
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think it's more

324
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
how much and how we introduce

325
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
it and how we frame it

326
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to people.

327
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's the simple answer.

328
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay.

329
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So kind of like

330
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
one thing that you guys

331
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
are liking is kind of

332
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
like the soft enrageous

333
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
where over time

334
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
eventually it gets

335
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
to get so difficult

336
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
that you're eventually

337
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
going to lose.

338
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

339
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Fancy 14 does a good job

340
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
with this as well.

341
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Like they have this idea

342
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
like, you know,

343
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
if you mess up a mechanic,

344
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
you're going to get

345
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
stacking deep off

346
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and it can escalate

347
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and get worse and worse

348
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
as the fight goes on.

349
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's an interesting way

350
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
to allow for some mistakes

351
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to occur for some learning

352
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to happen,

353
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
but really like

354
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and to punish you,

355
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
but not immediately

356
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
spike you

357
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and end the encounter.

358
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Awesome.

359
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So one thing that

360
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
see some other games

361
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
doing is they release

362
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
roadmaps of kind of

363
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
like in the same talk

364
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
of Endgame of things

365
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that,

366
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Callie,

367
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
stop it.

368
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sit down.

369
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Sorry about that.

370
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So for Diablo 4,

371
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
will we ever see

372
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
roadmaps come out

373
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
kind of showing

374
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
like detailing

375
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
what might be coming

376
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
in the next six months

377
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
to a year?

378
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I know that there's

379
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
some challenges

380
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
with that.

381
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Like if you guys

382
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
change your mind,

383
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
then like the community

384
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
gets really mad at you.

385
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What are your thoughts

386
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
on that?

387
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think it's important

388
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
that community knows

389
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that we are identifying

390
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
problems,

391
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you know,

392
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and that we are listening,

393
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
as I've said before.

394
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And I think that a roadmap

395
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,000
does a good job

396
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
of expressing

397
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
some of this information,

398
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
but it does,

399
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to your point,

400
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
does lock us

401
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
into a schedule.

402
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So I think that we're

403
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
kind of like thinking

404
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
about how we want

405
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to approach like explaining

406
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
these sorts of things.

407
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Like you'll recall

408
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
back in like season two,

409
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I mentioned at the very end

410
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
of actually between

411
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
when we were wrapping up

412
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
season two and AOZ was out

413
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and we were getting ready

414
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
to begin talking

415
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
about season three,

416
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I mentioned that we had

417
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
identified a lot

418
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
of itemization issues

419
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and things we wanted

420
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
to make like upgrades to

421
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and make updates,

422
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
which turned into

423
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the season of Loot Reborn

424
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and season four.

425
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You know,

426
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I wanted to make it clear

427
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
that we identified

428
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
a lot of the issues

429
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that the players

430
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
have been talking

431
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
to us about for a while,

432
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but we weren't able

433
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
to like immediately resolve

434
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
those sorts of things.

435
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I don't want,

436
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
one thing I,

437
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
when I occasionally see

438
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
from players

439
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
when they see a long roadmap

440
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
is they'll see something

441
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that they care deeply

442
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
about it,

443
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
like really,

444
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
really towards the end

445
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
of a year

446
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and they'll ask them like,

447
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
well,

448
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
do they not think

449
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
this is important?

450
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Do they not care about this?

451
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And I,

452
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I think that there's a way

453
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
for us to talk

454
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
about these things

455
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that players feel

456
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that they have confidence

457
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
like that we are

458
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
looking at these problems

459
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and we do have plans.

460
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I just think

461
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
we're just working

462
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
through exactly the way

463
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that we want

464
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
to approach this.

465
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah,

466
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think I'll chime

467
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
in a little bit.

468
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
One of the things

469
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that you're going to hear

470
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
is a constant theme

471
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
from me

472
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and other designers

473
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
say this with different words.

474
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But there's this idea

475
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
that there's,

476
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
there's rarely

477
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
really perfect solutions.

478
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's really only

479
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
trade-offs in the world.

480
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And this actually comes

481
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
from an economic term

482
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
that says that there's

483
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
never solutions,

484
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
only trade-offs.

485
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But, you know,

486
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
when you ask us things like,

487
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
you know,

488
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
why don't you do X or Y

489
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
or why don't you provide roadmaps?

490
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The way that our brains

491
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
immediately go is,

492
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
well,

493
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
there's pros and cons

494
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and which decision is best

495
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
trying to get the most pros

496
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
that we can

497
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
with the least cons

498
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that we can, right?

499
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
A simple example

500
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
with roadmaps

501
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
is the pro of roadmap

502
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
is everybody's on the same page.

503
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We show that,

504
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
hey,

505
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
we care about these things

506
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and the community

507
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
knows what to expect, right?

508
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Obviously,

509
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that is a desirable thing to do.

510
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But there's big cons

511
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
that maybe we have

512
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that you don't see.

513
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And this is where

514
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
most design discussions

515
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
end up of people asking us,

516
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
well,

517
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
what do you think

518
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
as developers?

519
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
is that we try to explain

520
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the cons to you

521
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
so that you understand

522
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the full picture.

523
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You know,

524
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
the cons of a roadmap

525
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
is we're locked in now.

526
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We've promised things to you

527
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that we may not be able to do

528
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
for whatever reason

529
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
when things end up

530
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
changing down the road, right?

531
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Life has a way

532
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
of screwing with your plans,

533
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
especially when you try

534
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to plan things more long-term.

535
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This isn't just true

536
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
with game design,

537
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
but anything.

538
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So we try to keep,

539
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
make promises

540
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and keep promises.

541
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Like,

542
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
one of my things

543
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm really passionate about

544
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
as a designer is

545
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
when it comes to interacting

546
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
with the community,

547
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
making promises

548
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and then keeping them.

549
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So I'm extremely careful

550
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
of the promises.

551
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I mean,

552
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
this is just my strategy

553
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
of how to build trust

554
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
with people

555
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and the community

556
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and just life in general

557
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
is I'm very careful

558
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
of what promises I make

559
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and then I make damn sure

560
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
when I do

561
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
that I keep them.

562
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And so to do that,

563
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the longer our roadmap

564
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
goes out,

565
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
the higher chance

566
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
we're not going to keep

567
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
those promises.

568
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Some things,

569
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
for example,

570
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
that we've seeded in the past,

571
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I remember it was either

572
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
our season one

573
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
or season two

574
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
campfire chat.

575
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I made a list of things

576
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
that our team

577
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
wants to do longer term.

578
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,000
One of those things

579
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
on those lists

580
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
was making scaling mechanics

581
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
for legendaries

582
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
that kind of suck.

583
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And we finally were doing

584
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that in season four,

585
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
right?

586
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You know,

587
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,000
your earthquake,

588
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
legendaries,

589
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
all of those,

590
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
we finally made them scale

591
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
with your weapon

592
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
to make the damage go up.

593
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I also talked about

594
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
at the time,

595
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and we haven't delivered

596
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
on this yet in my opinion,

597
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
but making ultimates

598
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
meaningful and scale

599
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
in a similar way.

600
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's on our radar,

601
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
something I want to do.

602
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Haven't done it yet.

603
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I didn't give a date

604
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
because I don't know

605
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
when the date is

606
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
because our timelines

607
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and schedules

608
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and priorities

609
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
changed quite a bit

610
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
based on community feedback.

611
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You know,

612
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
if I had made the promise

613
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,000
like,

614
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,000
hey,

615
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
we're definitely

616
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
fixing ultimates,

617
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
then Loot Reborn

618
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
wouldn't have happened

619
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
because I have to spend

620
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
my team's time

621
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
on doing that other thing.

622
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But this other thing

623
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
came up that I think

624
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
is way more important

625
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
for the game.

626
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And that's just kind of

627
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
how the nature

628
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
of our job goes.

629
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you for the

630
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
super detailed answer.

631
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And that is a perfect

632
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
segue into my next question.

633
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's kind of like

634
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
an edition of Mythbusters,

635
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
kind of.

636
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So a lot of people

637
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in the community,

638
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
a lot of the people

639
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
that are angry

640
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
in the community

641
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
about, you know,

642
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
whatever it is

643
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
they're angry about

644
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
at the time,

645
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
they say that...

646
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They're passionate

647
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
about something.

648
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Passionate.

649
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Very passionate.

650
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's the word

651
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
we're looking for.

652
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Constructively passionate, yeah.

653
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, constructively passionate.

654
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So one thing that I...

655
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They have like the meme video

656
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
of you guys saying

657
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
feedback, feedback, feedback.

658
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then on the internet

659
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
from a bunch of different angles

660
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
they say,

661
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Blizzard doesn't listen

662
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
to feedback.

663
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
They don't do anything.

664
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They don't even test their game.

665
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We're their beta testers.

666
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Da-da-da-da.

667
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So I wanted to ask you guys,

668
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
could you give us

669
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,000
some insights

670
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
into how your team

671
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
actually processes

672
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and internalizes feedback?

673
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Is it like concatenated

674
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
for you and you guys

675
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
have a meeting

676
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and you discuss it like that?

677
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
How do you guys

678
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
go about testing things

679
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
internally

680
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to kind of debunk

681
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
all of these myths

682
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that you guys are just

683
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
working by yourselves

684
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and never listening

685
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,000
to anything

686
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
which we know is not true?

687
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You want to go first, Joe?

688
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, I think we both

689
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,000
probably have different things

690
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
you want to say about this.

691
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So I think that...

692
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The point on feedback

693
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that I think you're...

694
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's being brought up,

695
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
there's like kind of two things.

696
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Like one,

697
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
are the designers in a corner

698
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
entirely by themselves

699
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
like just making decisions

700
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
with no information

701
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
being good to them.

702
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And the other version

703
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
is like,

704
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
is the team listening

705
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
to the community, right?

706
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And then how do we process

707
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
these sorts of things, right?

708
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So the...

709
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Starting from the

710
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
does the team

711
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
listen to the community

712
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
like side of this thing,

713
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
you know,

714
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
we are always reading

715
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
everything on...

716
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's getting posted on Reddit.

717
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We're getting everything

718
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that's posted on the forums.

719
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We're going through

720
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
our socials

721
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,000
on a regular basis.

722
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We have teams

723
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and people like Adam Fletcher,

724
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you know,

725
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,000
the community director.

726
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He's going through

727
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and like kind of gathering

728
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000
a lot of this information

729
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
for us.

730
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And in places where we don't...

731
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Like I personally can't read

732
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
every thread

733
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
in every social media site, right?

734
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You can't?

735
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I can't.

736
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Because there's other things

737
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I also do as part of my job.

738
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But I do read a lot of stuff, right?

739
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And a lot of things

740
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
get sent to me.

741
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So a lot of that stuff

742
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,000
can get like kind of

743
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
pulled together

744
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
for like reporting purposes

745
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and brought to us, right?

746
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I think that's

747
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
really, really useful.

748
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We also have a lot

749
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
of internal feedback

750
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
that we get from the team.

751
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like, so when we start

752
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,000
working on something,

753
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000
we were able to like

754
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
kind of give a presentation

755
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
to the overall dev team

756
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
to get an idea

757
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
of what we're trying to do.

758
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
We have regular play tests

759
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
where like a large group of people

760
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
all get a chance

761
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
to kind of give us feedback

762
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
on a regular basis.

763
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And we can keep checking in

764
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
with them as time goes on.

765
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So that's...

766
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think that's a starting point

767
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,000
for these things.

768
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But it's really important to us

769
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
that we are like hearing things

770
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
from the community

771
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
because that's kind of telling us

772
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
like are the changes

773
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
that we're making right now,

774
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
are they effective?

775
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Like are people having

776
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
a good time with these things?

777
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Because we can look

778
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
at all kinds of data

779
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
to determine things.

780
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But like hearing

781
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
when people talk about it

782
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
is also really, really important.

783
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
When they have...

784
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,000
When players have needs

785
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that aren't met,

786
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
you know, it's our job

787
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
to find ways to kind of

788
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
like bridge the gap there

789
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and make sure that they're being heard

790
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and the game is going to be

791
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
more fun for them.

792
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But what do you want to talk about?

793
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah.

794
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So firstly, I would say

795
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
different game companies,

796
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
different teams,

797
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and even different teams

798
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
within a bigger team

799
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
have different cultures

800
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and ideas and ways

801
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
that they process feedback.

802
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So I'll tell you

803
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
what I do on my team

804
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and kind of what D4

805
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
kind of does

806
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
as a larger team, right?

807
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So on the live team,

808
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
we are probably

809
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
the most interactive

810
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
with feedback

811
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,000
because we're doing

812
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
the live changes.

813
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
We have to be very connected

814
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to the game

815
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
to make good decisions.

816
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So I give this speech

817
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
a lot to the people

818
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
in my group

819
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
of your job

820
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
as a designer

821
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
is to go and find

822
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
the problems

823
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
with the game

824
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and then you are

825
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,000
the filter

826
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
when the community

827
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,000
comes in

828
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
and brings up things,

829
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
whether it's a streamer

830
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
giving things.

831
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I post things all the time

832
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,000
from streamers.

833
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I post things all the time

834
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,000
from Reddit threads.

835
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I post things all the time

836
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
from our forums.

837
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Anywhere that you can go out

838
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and go.

839
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And also,

840
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
personal play experience.

841
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Nothing replaces that as well.

842
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So we actually dedicate

843
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,000
every day

844
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
at least some amount of time

845
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
that everybody in my group

846
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,000
is either playing

847
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
an internal build

848
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
of future things

849
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,000
coming out in the game,

850
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
which I'm playing

851
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
through season five right now

852
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and I'm really far in it,

853
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
or they're playing

854
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
their live character

855
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,000
in the live game

856
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
because you need

857
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
to understand the game

858
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and understand the problems.

859
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And the way that I do things

860
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and what I've been trying

861
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
to tell my team

862
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and I think we're pretty good at

863
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
is while you are parsing

864
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
all this feedback

865
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and playing the game yourself,

866
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you keep a running list

867
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,000
of notes

868
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
of crap that sucks

869
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that you want to make better

870
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
or ideas that other people had

871
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
that you think are good ideas

872
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
that you want to make better.

873
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Now, of course,

874
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
not every idea is equal, right?

875
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You don't copy

876
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
every Reddit thread

877
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and every single thing

878
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that someone says.

879
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We are the filter

880
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
of trying to figure out,

881
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
remember I talked about

882
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
those no perfect solutions

883
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
only trade-offs?

884
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
This is where we're like,

885
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
hey, they brought up an idea

886
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and we think it's good.

887
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Now we need to explore

888
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
if that can actually work

889
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
in the game.

890
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And this is where we come up

891
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
with our list of things

892
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and priorities

893
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
that we're going to do.

894
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's a starting point.

895
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's one of a few starting points.

896
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The first starting point

897
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
is community feedback,

898
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,000
our own play experience.

899
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Another one is telemetry.

900
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's just a fancy word for data.

901
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We have the ability

902
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
to see data all over the game

903
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,000
of how many people

904
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
are equipping

905
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,000
different legendary aspects,

906
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,000
how many people

907
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
are engaging

908
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
with certain types of content.

909
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We can see what's working,

910
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,000
what's not working,

911
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
what people are actually doing

912
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
versus what they say.

913
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Usually what they say

914
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,000
will match

915
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
with what people are doing,

916
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
but there's a mismatch

917
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
that we have to have

918
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,000
a discussion of like,

919
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
hey, how important

920
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
is this actually?

921
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then another way

922
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
is internal testing tools.

923
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Again, we have groups

924
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that give us presentations

925
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and people who their job

926
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
is to look through data

927
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and do focus sessions

928
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and all kinds

929
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
of other fancy tricks

930
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
to come up with stories

931
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and understanding

932
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
the different types

933
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
of players we have

934
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and what they're doing

935
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and how they work.

936
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And they give us presentations

937
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
on different topics

938
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
that we're interested in

939
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
or they find their own topics

940
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,000
of things that maybe

941
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
we didn't think of

942
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
that we may have missed.

943
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And then last but not least,

944
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
we have internal people.

945
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You know, we have a big team

946
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
of people working on this game

947
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and we have certain feedback avenues

948
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
via emails or channels

949
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that we give feedback

950
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
to each other

951
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
because on new stuff,

952
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
we can't rely on telemetry

953
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
or the community

954
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
or all those other things.

955
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And that's where things

956
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
are a lot harder.

957
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I think Joe went into this yesterday

958
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
a little more deeper,

959
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
so I'll just gloss over it.

960
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But this idea that Diablo

961
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
is a freaking huge game

962
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
that takes forever to play

963
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and really truly understands

964
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
because our systems

965
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
are so interconnected.

966
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So there is no substitute

967
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
for actually going through

968
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
that 80 plus hour experience

969
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and playing everything.

970
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The part that makes that really hard

971
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and where I think the community

972
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
gives us a hard time sometimes,

973
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I think a little bit of it

974
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
is warranted,

975
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
but it's a cursed problem

976
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,000
is what I call it,

977
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
which is another concept

978
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll go into later,

979
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is that to really test our game,

980
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
you need to spend your life

981
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
playing our game in many ways

982
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
or a lot of time,

983
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
more times,

984
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
more hours

985
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
than what you normally

986
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
would expect someone

987
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
to work at a job, right?

988
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So we can't tell people,

989
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
hey, you must spend

990
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
all your life playing this game,

991
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
but also, by the way,

992
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,000
you have to design

993
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and create the new things too, right?

994
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So that means that internally,

995
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
it is really hard to playtest

996
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the full amount of our game

997
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,000
as a designer.

998
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We have to rely on,

999
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
we have people in QA

1000
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and other playtesters

1001
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
that do play this content.

1002
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We either direct them

1003
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
of things we want to test and play

1004
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
or they just find things

1005
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,000
on their own

1006
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
that they think,

1007
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
hey, they bring it up to us,

1008
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,000
like, hey, we think

1009
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
this is a problem

1010
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and we have to parse that.

1011
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But there isn't enough time

1012
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
for a single designer

1013
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
or every designer

1014
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
to play the game fully

1015
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
all the time,

1016
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
but we do still play it

1017
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
a good amount

1018
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,000
and we use those

1019
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
internal feedback mechanisms

1020
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
to make things the best

1021
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,000
that they can.

1022
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And this is where I think

1023
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
there is that little

1024
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
disconnect sometimes

1025
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,000
with the community

1026
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
where, yeah,

1027
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
we would love to polish things

1028
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and play it.

1029
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Now, I would love to play

1030
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
season five 200 hours

1031
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
before it comes out.

1032
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I only get it for,

1033
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
you know, 50 hours, right?

1034
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And we have to use our guts

1035
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and existing ideas

1036
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and telemetry

1037
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
to figure out

1038
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
if the decisions

1039
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,000
we make are right.

1040
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And then we use

1041
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
after we launch the game

1042
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
to really fine tune

1043
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and make it perfect, right?

1044
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And that's kind of

1045
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the overall process

1046
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
of how things work.

1047
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, one last thing

1048
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I want to add here too

1049
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
is that even,

1050
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
we're just thinking about

1051
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
like a feature,

1052
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,000
like we're talking

1053
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
about adding one thing,

1054
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
like something like the pit,

1055
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
for example.

1056
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Good example,

1057
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
because it's going to be new

1058
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,000
coming out in season four.

1059
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If you sit down

1060
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and you play the pit

1061
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
for an hour one day,

1062
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
you're going to feel

1063
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
a certain way

1064
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,000
about your experience

1065
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
playing the pit.

1066
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're going to feel

1067
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
differently if you play

1068
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that for two hours a day,

1069
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,000
five days straight,

1070
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,000
you know,

1071
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and you experience it

1072
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
through that entire process.

1073
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're going to have

1074
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
a different relationship

1075
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
with the content

1076
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
at that point.

1077
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And players are going to go,

1078
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you know,

1079
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
10, 20x that number

1080
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,000
by the time they're done

1081
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
playing in season potentially.

1082
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So like it's really,

1083
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,000
really important

1084
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that we get the reps

1085
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
in on these features

1086
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,000
to make sure

1087
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
that they're really resonating

1088
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and they're saying

1089
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
they're doing everything

1090
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
that they need to do, right?

1091
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So I think if there's a,

1092
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,000
there's a lot of truth

1093
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
to everything that Adam's

1094
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,000
talking about.

1095
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Everything is a lot of trade-offs.

1096
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
There's a lot of things

1097
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,000
we need to do.

1098
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And this kind of links

1099
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,000
now suddenly we're able

1100
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
to like take,

1101
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
take what we already know

1102
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,000
about the season

1103
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and then multiply that

1104
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
like 10, 20, 50 fold

1105
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
as we get tons of players

1106
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,000
going in,

1107
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
checking things out,

1108
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
not just from the telemetry,

1109
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
but also just in the feedback

1110
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
we're getting from content creators,

1111
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
from players themselves.

1112
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Like we've got a lot

1113
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
of really good data for that.

1114
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So it's been,

1115
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
it's been very useful

1116
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
for the same reasons

1117
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,000
that Adam talks about.

1118
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah.

1119
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I mean,

1120
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
go ahead.

1121
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Sorry.

1122
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,000
No, go ahead.

1123
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
One last real quick thing

1124
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
is this is where you get things

1125
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that seem obvious to players

1126
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
that were bad ideas,

1127
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
but sounded like really good ideas

1128
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,000
when we're sitting in a room

1129
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
talking about it.

1130
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That simple example

1131
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll give in season four

1132
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
is when you temper

1133
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
your items or things

1134
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and there's like a really nice thing

1135
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
that plays

1136
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and you can see it,

1137
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
it's visual,

1138
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
but you can't skip it easily,

1139
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,000
right?

1140
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That kind of stuff

1141
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
is where sometimes

1142
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
things fall through the cracks

1143
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
of, hey,

1144
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
doing this 2,000 times

1145
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
is actually terrible

1146
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
because you've got to wait forever

1147
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
versus, well,

1148
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
we want to have a moment

1149
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
of celebration

1150
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and for the cool thing

1151
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,000
to be cool.

1152
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Balancing these things

1153
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
is what can be harder

1154
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,000
to do internally

1155
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
where obviously

1156
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
we've messed up enough times

1157
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and this is true

1158
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
for every game company,

1159
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
so I'm not afraid to admit it,

1160
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
but we've made that mistake

1161
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,000
enough times

1162
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
that now we're very cognizant of it,

1163
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
like we make a new feature

1164
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
or a new activity,

1165
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,000
like, hey,

1166
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
how does this feel

1167
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
if you're doing it for 200 hours?

1168
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Is this still going to be something

1169
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
that people want to go through,

1170
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,000
right?

1171
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That's a question now

1172
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
that we ask all the time,

1173
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
but even then,

1174
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
there are times

1175
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,000
where we have to kill

1176
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
otherwise good ideas

1177
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
or we have to flex a little bit

1178
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
because we do need

1179
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
some presentation

1180
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
or some tutorialization

1181
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
or some other thing

1182
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
to balance that

1183
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
even if it makes

1184
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
the 2,000 times experience

1185
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
a little bit worse,

1186
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
right?

1187
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The answer's not always

1188
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,000
so obvious,

1189
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I guess,

1190
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
but we are receptive

1191
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
to like when the community

1192
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
tells us clearly,

1193
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,000
hey, no,

1194
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
we want it to be this way,

1195
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
we're going to do it that way.

1196
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I mean,

1197
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
it was a lot of great points.

1198
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I mean,

1199
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm very glad

1200
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that I asked that question

1201
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
because the thing

1202
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
that is refreshing to me,

1203
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
the thing that I wanted

1204
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
to hear more than anything

1205
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
is that you guys

1206
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
have a chance

1207
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
to actually play

1208
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
through the game

1209
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and not only to hear

1210
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
that you guys play the game

1211
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
as almost part

1212
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
of the job description,

1213
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,000
but it sounds like

1214
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you actually put

1215
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
a big effort into that.

1216
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I mean,

1217
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
that makes me feel,

1218
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
that makes me feel great,

1219
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,000
honestly.

1220
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's so great to hear.

1221
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm so glad

1222
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
that's part of the process.

1223
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Talking about

1224
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
some of the current

1225
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
modes in the game,

1226
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
let's talk about,

1227
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
you talked about yesterday

1228
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
the State of Nightmare Dungeons,

1229
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and CJ did a ton

1230
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
of iteration on it.

1231
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Now we can teleport to them.

1232
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You just buffed Glyph XP.

1233
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You said that you'd like

1234
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
to add more fun things

1235
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
to do to them

1236
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
in the future.

1237
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You guys made events

1238
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
better now.

1239
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I saw Goblin Pax,

1240
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I think,

1241
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,000
on the PTR

1242
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
when you put

1243
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
the Vampire Ambushers.

1244
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That was good.

1245
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You reduced the cast time

1246
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
down to 0.75 seconds,

1247
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
so we're going to have

1248
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
new things coming out

1249
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,000
for it.

1250
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
My question is,

1251
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
is going forward,

1252
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
it looks like you guys

1253
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
made a ton of

1254
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
qualitative changes to it.

1255
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You just make it

1256
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
a little bit easier

1257
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,000
to access

1258
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
all of these different things

1259
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
rather than riding around

1260
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,000
on your pony

1261
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
to every single thing

1262
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and everything takes forever.

1263
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
When you are designing

1264
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
future things,

1265
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
is that kind of

1266
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
at the front of your mind

1267
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
with things like,

1268
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,000
oh,

1269
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
maybe at Nightmare Dungeons

1270
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,000
we can carry

1271
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
multiple objects?

1272
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Because if there's

1273
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
two rocks and two pedestals,

1274
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
if you go rock, rock,

1275
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,000
you're guaranteed

1276
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
to backtrack.

1277
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I mean,

1278
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I have two hands.

1279
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And then,

1280
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,000
have you thought about

1281
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
reducing the cast time

1282
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,000
even further?

1283
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I know that one comment

1284
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,000
was,

1285
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
if the cast time

1286
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
is so low,

1287
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
then people may not

1288
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
even see that they

1289
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
interacted with something.

1290
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
But maybe that could be

1291
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
updated via like a

1292
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
little quest thing.

1293
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh, quest,

1294
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,000
pick up two rocks.

1295
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, it highlights.

1296
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Oh, now pick up one rock.

1297
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And another part of it was,

1298
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
it's not just that

1299
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I have a problem

1300
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
freeing prisoners.

1301
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I have a problem

1302
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
going to Dead Man's Dredge,

1303
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and the quest objective

1304
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
is I have to free

1305
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
seven prisoners.

1306
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Like,

1307
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
how many people

1308
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
got caught here?

1309
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Is qualitative stuff

1310
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
still at the front

1311
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
of your mind

1312
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
when you're iterating

1313
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,000
on these things

1314
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and in the future

1315
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
events that you're

1316
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
going to make?

1317
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So I think that there's

1318
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
a couple different pieces

1319
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
to pick apart here,

1320
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,000
right?

1321
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So with Nightmare Dungeons,

1322
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,000
they're building upon

1323
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
the dungeons we had

1324
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
in Diablo 4,

1325
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,000
right?

1326
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And these were supposed

1327
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
to be these really

1328
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
kind of interesting

1329
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
little content things

1330
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you could find

1331
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
all over the world.

1332
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They all had a little bit

1333
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
of environmental

1334
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
storytelling,

1335
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
objective-based storytelling,

1336
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
some side quest points

1337
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
to these dungeons as well.

1338
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And we want players

1339
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
to feel like they're

1340
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
going on a little bit

1341
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,000
of an adventure

1342
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
when they go into these.

1343
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We didn't initially

1344
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
make the content

1345
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
in these spaces

1346
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,000
to feel like

1347
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,000
they were just

1348
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
blast corridors,

1349
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,000
if that makes sense,

1350
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,000
right?

1351
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So I think that

1352
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
as we think about

1353
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
what different players

1354
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
are looking for

1355
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and what we can do

1356
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
to improve the experience

1357
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,000
for everybody,

1358
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
we don't want to lose

1359
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
the kind of like

1360
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
the contextual

1361
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and like fantasy

1362
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
underpinnings

1363
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
of what players

1364
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,000
are doing

1365
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,000
when they go

1366
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
into these spaces.

1367
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
To your point,

1368
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,000
like, you know,

1369
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
it's not that you hate

1370
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
freeing prisoners,

1371
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
no, but you don't like

1372
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,000
that it might take,

1373
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
you know,

1374
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
0.75 seconds to do it

1375
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
is one question,

1376
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,000
maybe.

1377
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And then there's

1378
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
another one where it's

1379
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,000
like, we don't want

1380
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
to free seven.

1381
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So you kind of want

1382
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,000
to be like a faster,

1383
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,000
more punchy experience,

1384
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
but it's not that you

1385
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
don't like having to

1386
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
click those objects

1387
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
as part of your experience

1388
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
going through a dungeon.

1389
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I think that like

1390
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
there's, I think

1391
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
there's an expectation

1392
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
when players are like

1393
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
doing some of these

1394
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,000
actions that there is

1395
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
a response.

1396
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So having just a,

1397
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
like a quest tick

1398
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
for some things,

1399
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm not saying that

1400
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
this is where we would

1401
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
only ever make this

1402
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,000
decision,

1403
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and a quest tick for

1404
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
things like freeing a

1405
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
prisoner, it is,

1406
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,000
it is feedback.

1407
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Is it as impactful

1408
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
as having the moment

1409
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,000
where you get to see

1410
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
your character on

1411
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the binds?

1412
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I'm not so sure,

1413
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
you know, but in the

1414
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
end, is that value,

1415
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,000
it's to Adam's point

1416
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
earlier, but like,

1417
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,000
you know, it's about

1418
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
making trade-offs.

1419
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Is the, is the idea

1420
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
for the player who

1421
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
does care, does care

1422
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
about like kind of

1423
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,000
going slowly through

1424
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
the space and trying

1425
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
to find the collectibles

1426
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and trying to do

1427
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,000
all these things,

1428
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
for that player,

1429
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
is it, is it going

1430
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
to be a big miss

1431
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
for them if they

1432
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,000
click on stuff and

1433
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
just kind of like

1434
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,000
has a quick update,

1435
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,000
doesn't feel like

1436
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
anything really changed.

1437
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So it's sort of like

1438
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,000
where we want to

1439
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
optimize things.

1440
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think when you

1441
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
look at content

1442
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,000
like the, like the

1443
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
pit, you know,

1444
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and a lot of things

1445
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
we did in Helltide

1446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
as well, you know,

1447
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,000
we've made a lot

1448
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
of attempts to try

1449
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,000
to make sure that

1450
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
the content feels like

1451
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
there is less friction,

1452
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
you know, as you're

1453
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,000
going through.

1454
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So like when you

1455
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
get into a flow state

1456
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
that you're happy with,

1457
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
that you can kind of

1458
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
maintain that pace.

1459
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So, and we made a

1460
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
number of changes

1461
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,000
we already called out

1462
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
to Nightmare Dungeons

1463
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,000
to also kind of

1464
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
support this.

1465
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So I think it's a

1466
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,000
question of like how

1467
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
much further do we

1468
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
want to go within

1469
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Nightmare Dungeons

1470
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
specifically, right?

1471
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Because I think we've

1472
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,000
already said that we're

1473
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
looking at this for

1474
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
other pieces of content.

1475
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I don't know where

1476
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,000
we're going to fall

1477
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
necessarily for the

1478
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
channel time for

1479
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
clicking on objects

1480
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and freeing them.

1481
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It could be that it

1482
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
comes out a little

1483
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,000
bit lower.

1484
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It could be that we

1485
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
decide we want to

1486
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
make changes to make

1487
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,000
it more instant

1488
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,000
instantaneous.

1489
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We haven't really

1490
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
made a decision.

1491
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You know, we'll

1492
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
continue to be looking

1493
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,000
at feedback as we

1494
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
play and also from

1495
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
like different players

1496
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,000
like players who are

1497
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
just playing Diablo 4

1498
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
for the first time.

1499
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I want to kind of

1500
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
hear what their

1501
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
experience is like as

1502
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,000
well.

1503
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Awesome.

1504
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So here's kind of

1505
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
like a, here's kind

1506
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
of like maybe a huge

1507
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
question, but it

1508
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
asks very directly.

1509
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So what is kind of

1510
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
the future of the

1511
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
overworld in Diablo 4?

1512
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
When we first released,

1513
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
it was kind of the

1514
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
main thing you used

1515
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
to do everything and

1516
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
kind of the first

1517
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,000
experience was that

1518
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
50 to 100 grind.

1519
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Now 1 to 100 is much

1520
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
easier and the focus

1521
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
is probably, you know,

1522
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
having, enjoying that

1523
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
journey, going to the

1524
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
pit and anything in the

1525
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,000
future that you're going

1526
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
to release.

1527
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
A lot of the things that

1528
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
seem to come out though,

1529
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
the abattoir and the

1530
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
challenge riff thing and

1531
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
the pit, they're all

1532
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
instanced things.

1533
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Are there big plans for

1534
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,000
the overworld?

1535
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Is that still like the

1536
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
defining characteristic of

1537
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Diablo 4 or are we

1538
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
moving away from that?

1539
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So we, you know, Diablo

1540
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
4 and the fact that we

1541
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
have this like big

1542
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
contiguous sanctuary is

1543
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
still a really big part

1544
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,000
of Diablo 4.

1545
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Now, I think that we

1546
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
want to continue to

1547
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
expand the landmass and

1548
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
the areas where players

1549
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,000
can explore.

1550
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That's still an important

1551
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
part of things.

1552
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But in terms of how

1553
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
players are engaging with

1554
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
the experience overall,

1555
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
we do expect that one of

1556
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
the downsides of the

1557
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
open world is that it's a

1558
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
fixed layout, right?

1559
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So if we think about

1560
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
like the sorts of things

1561
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
that players like to play

1562
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
in a, in a, in a, in a

1563
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
like a playable content

1564
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
fashion, right?

1565
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's not normally in place

1566
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
where you like really want

1567
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000
to keep running through

1568
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
exactly the same glade in

1569
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
the fracture piece or

1570
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
exactly the same area, you

1571
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
know, of Kerstan.

1572
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's, it's, it's usually

1573
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
you're trying to like find

1574
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
like different things to

1575
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
kind of go engage with.

1576
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And like our dungeon

1577
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
systems are places where

1578
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
you can really do a lot

1579
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
more of that.

1580
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I think we push it really

1581
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
well within Helltides.

1582
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You know, there's lots of

1583
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
things happening in

1584
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Helltides.

1585
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
They're pretty

1586
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
procedural in terms of

1587
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
how things respond in and

1588
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
like what sorts of events

1589
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,000
you might find as you're

1590
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
kind of wandering around.

1591
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But in terms of like

1592
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
having a lot more like

1593
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,000
flexibility to create

1594
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
different experiences, we

1595
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
have that really more in

1596
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
other systems.

1597
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But I think for, this is

1598
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
like going back to some

1599
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
things I talked about the

1600
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
other day, there's sort of

1601
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
like the experience that

1602
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
a player has.

1603
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Diablo is a, is a, is a

1604
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,000
big game, right?

1605
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And, and I don't say that

1606
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
to suggest that any, any,

1607
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
anyone's needs are less

1608
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
important, just that there

1609
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,000
are a lot of different

1610
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
needs.

1611
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Different players have

1612
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,000
different expectations.

1613
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So when some players come

1614
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
into Diablo, like they're

1615
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
here because they want to

1616
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,000
go through like this epic

1617
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
story.

1618
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
They want to play their,

1619
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
they really want to play

1620
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
a sorceress and they want

1621
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
to like see what happens

1622
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to little, if they want to

1623
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,000
go explore all, they want

1624
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
to find all the things in

1625
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
all the zones and they

1626
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
want to get really, really

1627
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,000
powerful.

1628
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And then they're going to,

1629
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
they're going to take a

1630
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
break until the expansion

1631
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,000
comes out.

1632
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That's just the way that

1633
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
they sort of play these

1634
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,000
games.

1635
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That's how they, that's

1636
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
how they play, right?

1637
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
For those players, these

1638
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
moments as they explore the

1639
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
world, it's really, really

1640
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,000
important because that's

1641
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
their experience with Diablo.

1642
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's like their exploration

1643
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
of the overworld, them

1644
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,000
going and finding all

1645
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
these side quests, talking

1646
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
to all these characters

1647
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and that's their

1648
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
relationship with the game.

1649
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
For players who play

1650
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
seasonally, you know, they

1651
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
it's, it's once you've

1652
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
kind of like uncovered all

1653
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
the applications and you

1654
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
found all these things and

1655
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
done this stuff, you don't,

1656
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
there's not usually a lot

1657
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
of reasons why you want to

1658
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,000
go and have that same

1659
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
moment of discovery again.

1660
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You can't really recreate

1661
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,000
it.

1662
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
We talked for a while about

1663
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
like moving little statues

1664
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
around season to season.

1665
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So you'd have to collect

1666
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
them again.

1667
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's, it's, it's another,

1668
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
another one of my

1669
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
brilliant ideas.

1670
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah.

1671
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So we didn't, we didn't do

1672
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
it of course.

1673
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Right.

1674
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But like we had the idea of

1675
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
like every season we'd

1676
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
move where the little

1677
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,000
statues could be found.

1678
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So players have to go

1679
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
find them again.

1680
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But then the next

1681
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
conversation is immediately

1682
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
like, well, okay, so

1683
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
people are going to go

1684
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
onto Maxwell or whatever

1685
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
and they're going to go

1686
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,000
immediately see where the

1687
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
node map is for the next

1688
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
set of ultra little.

1689
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Then that's now their new

1690
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
homework they have to do

1691
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
at the beginning of every

1692
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,000
season.

1693
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
They have to run around

1694
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,000
on their horse and go

1695
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
collect every single one

1696
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,000
of these.

1697
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And it's like, is that fun?

1698
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
No, clearly not for that

1699
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
for that player.

1700
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But it wasn't, it was

1701
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
necessarily horrible the

1702
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
first time players do this.

1703
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Like that's, that's part of

1704
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
the fun of like almost

1705
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
like an open world game

1706
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
anyway.

1707
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It's kind of like

1708
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
exploration and finding

1709
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
things.

1710
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So I know that I'm, I'm

1711
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
getting to go long, but

1712
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
so I think that the, the,

1713
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
the underpinning point

1714
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
here is that the, the

1715
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
overworld of Diablo 4 is

1716
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
so really, really important

1717
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
as we think about how to

1718
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
make the best use of it

1719
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
for like replayable content.

1720
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You know, Helltide's a

1721
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
good example of this.

1722
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Blood Harvest is really,

1723
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
really, really, really

1724
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,000
helpful for kind of

1725
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
giving us some like ideas

1726
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
of what players are really

1727
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
excited about things that

1728
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,000
we could do better.

1729
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Like the like kind of

1730
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
light social gameplay

1731
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
of summoning creatures and

1732
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,000
things.

1733
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And I think we have other

1734
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
ideas we continue to

1735
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,000
explore in that

1736
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
direction.

1737
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I think Legion events

1738
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and boss events are

1739
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
things we continue to

1740
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
like kind of iterate on

1741
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and think more about,

1742
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
you know, but I think

1743
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
that in terms of creating

1744
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
like, like really

1745
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
compelling replayable

1746
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
content, I think it's

1747
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
going to end up being in

1748
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
more of the space where

1749
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
you have like more

1750
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
procedural control over

1751
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
how like the dungeon is

1752
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
formulated or like what

1753
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
players can expect to

1754
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
encounter as opposed to

1755
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
these, these more fixed

1756
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
outdoor locations.

1757
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Does that answer your

1758
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,000
question?

1759
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah.

1760
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So I guess laughing at

1761
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,000
me.

1762
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I didn't answer the

1763
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,000
question.

1764
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
No, no.

1765
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
These are such in-depth

1766
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
answers.

1767
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm, I'm just scared.

1768
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm looking over at my

1769
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,000
questions.

1770
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm, I'm never going to,

1771
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm trying to figure out

1772
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
how to skip around for

1773
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,000
all of them.

1774
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So I guess I'm so sorry.

1775
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,000
No, no, no.

1776
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So the main takeaway that

1777
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm getting there is the

1778
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
overworld is a super

1779
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
important part of it, like

1780
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
a first player's experience

1781
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
discovering everything.

1782
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But then it's hard to

1783
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
recreate that magic for the

1784
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
people that come season to

1785
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
season to season.

1786
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And that's why it goes

1787
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
more to instance stuff is

1788
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
kind of, I guess the

1789
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
summary of, yeah, that's

1790
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
reasonable.

1791
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah.

1792
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I think we're also on a

1793
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
regular basis looking for

1794
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
new ways to engage with

1795
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
the, uh, with the open

1796
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
world in ways that are

1797
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
going to be fun for

1798
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,000
seasonal players as well.

1799
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Like, so we're, we're

1800
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
continuing to find like

1801
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
just experimenting with

1802
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,000
things, see what makes it

1803
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
like fun and new for

1804
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
players.

1805
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Okay.

1806
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I promised I would ask

1807
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,000
this.

1808
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So there, uh, maybe there

1809
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
might be a player out there

1810
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
that you guys have heard

1811
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
of and have maybe added, I

1812
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
don't know, hundreds of

1813
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
hours of overtime to the

1814
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
team, Rob and Rob, you

1815
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
familiar.

1816
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
That's a little familiar.

1817
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah.

1818
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So he got a Rob love

1819
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Rob.

1820
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,000
He is a good guy.

1821
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
He is a good guy.

1822
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
He had a two questions

1823
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,000
about the pit.

1824
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
These are probably a

1825
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
little bit more

1826
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
straightforward, but, um,

1827
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I guess for, for end

1828
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
game activities is, do

1829
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
you guys ever think about

1830
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
or worry about, I guess

1831
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
fishing?

1832
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So like it gets to a

1833
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
point in the pit where,

1834
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Oh, you're fishing for

1835
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
the right mob type or

1836
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
you're fishing for the

1837
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
right boss or, and then

1838
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
you just leave kind of

1839
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
like what happened in

1840
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Diablo three or, Oh,

1841
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm going to go get a

1842
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
very on.

1843
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And hopefully that it

1844
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
procs the amazing shrine

1845
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,000
for me.

1846
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So then I can finally win.

1847
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And do you guys off the

1848
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,000
top of your head know

1849
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
about how much the health

1850
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in the pit was buffed

1851
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,000
by?

1852
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And I, I'm guessing

1853
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
that the main idea for

1854
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
there is not only to add

1855
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
difficulty, but to

1856
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
actually, because the,

1857
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,000
when you were going

1858
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
through the pit, the

1859
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
bills are so strong that

1860
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
you delete the, the

1861
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
rift part of it in two

1862
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,000
minutes, like clockwork

1863
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
every time.

1864
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And the monsters don't

1865
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
even get to do

1866
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,000
anything.

1867
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So I assume like the

1868
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
part of the reason for

1869
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
buffing it is to actually

1870
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
even let them get a hit

1871
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000
on you and see what they

1872
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
even do.

1873
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yeah.

1874
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah.

1875
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I can take the first

1876
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
part of the question at

1877
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,000
least.

1878
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I mean, I can take both

1879
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,000
too.

1880
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Joe wants to take the

1881
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
other part.

1882
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So talk about

1883
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,000
fishing.

1884
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes.

1885
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Fishing for stuff keeps

1886
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
me up at night and I

1887
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,000
hate the problem.

1888
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And it's a really hard

1889
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
problem to solve.

1890
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Remember that no salute,

1891
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
you know, rarely perfect

1892
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
solutions, only trade

1893
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,000
offs thing.

1894
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Right.

1895
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So this very much

1896
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
applies to this type of

1897
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,000
problem.

1898
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Right.

1899
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
A core thing that we

1900
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
want in our game is,

1901
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
and when it comes to

1902
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
combat and effects and

1903
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
legendary powers and

1904
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
unique powers and

1905
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
whatever, is we want to

1906
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
push the envelope, make

1907
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000
cool shit.

1908
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Right.

1909
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So on one end of the

1910
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
spectrum, you need to

1911
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
make cool stuff.

1912
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Right.

1913
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And that involves doing

1914
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
things that aren't

1915
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
necessarily completely

1916
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
deterministic because I

1917
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
think completely

1918
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
deterministic things after

1919
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
a while get kind of

1920
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,000
boring.

1921
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Right.

1922
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
When you know that you're

1923
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
going to get this effect

1924
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
or it's up all the time

1925
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
or you do this and get

1926
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
this, like we do it a lot,

1927
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
by the way.

1928
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So I'm not saying that's not

1929
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
a good design, but just

1930
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
you need to have some

1931
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
spiciness, some really

1932
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
cool, crazy things.

1933
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Right.

1934
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And that that unique

1935
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
uber unique power is one

1936
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,000
of those.

1937
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
On the flip side, though,

1938
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
it means that when you

1939
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
make really hard content,

1940
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
doing things like wanting

1941
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
to make cool stuff,

1942
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
fishing gets in the way of

1943
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
that a lot of times,

1944
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
especially in randomly

1945
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
generated content, which is

1946
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
what, you know, the pit is

1947
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
in many ways.

1948
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So that is why we have to

1949
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
do things that we that by

1950
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
the way, we as designers

1951
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
don't like, like removing

1952
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
the fun shrines or the

1953
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
things that are going to

1954
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,000
break because then you

1955
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
just find the shrines that,

1956
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
you know, break the game

1957
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
in whatever way.

1958
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And that's all that you're

1959
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,000
doing.

1960
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And that becomes the game.

1961
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
This is a core thing about

1962
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
ARPGs that I, in my

1963
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
opinion, after working on

1964
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
it now for years, and I've

1965
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,000
been involved in pretty

1966
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
much every game genre

1967
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
extensively as a player

1968
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and many as a designer.

1969
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I think ARPGs are one of

1970
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
the hardest, if not the

1971
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
hardest genre to design

1972
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,000
for.

1973
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
MMOs are really high up

1974
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,000
there, too.

1975
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
There's a lot of other

1976
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
genres I think are very

1977
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
difficult, but ARPGs are

1978
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
a special slice of

1979
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
awfulness when it comes

1980
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
to trying to make things

1981
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
fun and also make them

1982
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
interesting.

1983
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And this is one of the

1984
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
reasons why.

1985
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So as far as, like, this

1986
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
exact design of the

1987
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
spear, we're keeping it in

1988
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,000
for now.

1989
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I would be very sad if we

1990
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
had to redesign it because

1991
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
it's the only way to get

1992
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
through high pit tiers.

1993
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,000
That would make me

1994
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
personally sad, but

1995
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
because that is the most

1996
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
difficult thing to do, we

1997
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
may have to make a tweak to

1998
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,000
it.

1999
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But we're not doing it yet.

2000
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,000
We're going to see how it

2001
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
plays out.

2002
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
But I think that the

2003
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
conversation is more

2004
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
interesting conceptually,

2005
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
like, you know, is this a

2006
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
problem?

2007
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes, absolutely.

2008
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Does it mean that we can't

2009
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000
do things that would

2010
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
otherwise be cool and

2011
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
awesome for your average

2012
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,000
player?

2013
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Yes, absolutely.

2014
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But we also think it's

2015
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
best for the game because

2016
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I think fishing for the

2017
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
right tile set, the right

2018
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
mob, like restarting a

2019
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
thing over and over to be

2020
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
able to progress is not

2021
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,000
fun.

2022
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And therefore, we have to

2023
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
design the rest of our

2024
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
game knowing that that is

2025
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
a thing.

2026
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yeah, just adding to that,

2027
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,000
too.

2028
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Like, I think that, you

2029
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
know, we definitely see

2030
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
fishing as a problem, so

2031
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
much so that we built the

2032
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
gauntlet, you know, for the

2033
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
trials feature with

2034
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
fishing specifically as the

2035
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
thing we're trying to

2036
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,000
account for.

2037
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Or we said, all right, if

2038
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000
we have a competitive

2039
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
content feature players are

2040
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,000
going to engage with and

2041
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
it's randomized, then

2042
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
players aren't really

2043
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
competing until they find

2044
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
exactly the right seed that

2045
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
they manage to roll to

2046
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
compete against because

2047
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
that's the actual optimal

2048
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,000
seed that they need to

2049
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
compete on.

2050
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's only against this

2051
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
monster family or only with

2052
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
this dungeon tile layout or

2053
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
only with this, like, these

2054
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
set of shrines or whatever

2055
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,000
it is.

2056
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So instead, what we did is

2057
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
we made a highly

2058
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
deterministic content type that

2059
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,000
changed it every week.

2060
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And players went to it

2061
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and said, like, well, why

2062
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
is it so fixed?

2063
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Like, this is boring.

2064
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Like, I want something

2065
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
that's different and

2066
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
changes every time.

2067
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But then you kind of fall

2068
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
back to that same point that

2069
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I have brought up about,

2070
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
like, these trade-offs for

2071
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
all the problems that we

2072
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,000
have.

2073
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Then we have to decide,

2074
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,000
like, all right, so we're

2075
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
okay with the idea that,

2076
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
like, players are going to go

2077
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
into, like, a gauntlet run

2078
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and they're going to have a

2079
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
wildly disparate experience

2080
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
potentially between person A

2081
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and person B.

2082
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And they're just

2083
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
continually running the

2084
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
content over and over again

2085
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
in the hopes they

2086
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
eventually get a good seed

2087
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and that might be the way

2088
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,000
that they're able to

2089
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
place because the difference

2090
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
could potentially be vast

2091
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
between one thing and the

2092
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,000
next.

2093
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So it's a, you know,

2094
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
it's a complicated space.

2095
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's something we

2096
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
definitely think about.

2097
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
The other part of your

2098
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
question was, what did we

2099
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
do about the, what did we

2100
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
do about, like, health

2101
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,000
scaling in the pit?

2102
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The HP, yeah.

2103
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
How much did it go up by?

2104
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah.

2105
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So we did make some big

2106
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
changes there.

2107
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So basically what was

2108
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
happening in the PTR is

2109
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
that monster scaling,

2110
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
monster health scaling was

2111
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
pretty mild in the pit

2112
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,000
going through the first

2113
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
hundred levels.

2114
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It was basically virtually

2115
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
nil, you know, from

2116
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
level 100 on.

2117
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
More or less.

2118
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Right.

2119
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So we ended up putting it

2120
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
in a place where, uh,

2121
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
like the tier 200 pit is

2122
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
like, okay.

2123
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So like, like around tier

2124
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
150 pit is like close to

2125
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
where AOZ was, you know,

2126
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
for like tier 25, uh, uh,

2127
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
AOZ runs and tier 200

2128
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
goes beyond that.

2129
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So it's pretty, it's pretty

2130
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
considerable.

2131
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The scaling has been

2132
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
increased.

2133
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We still want to be

2134
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
gradual as you're kind of

2135
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
progressing through, uh,

2136
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,000
because we want you to feel

2137
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
that you have a place to

2138
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,000
push.

2139
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's not like, so like

2140
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
because AOZ was 25 tiers

2141
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
extremely, extremely chunky

2142
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
when you went from tier to

2143
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
tier as you got deeper and

2144
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
deeper inside.

2145
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Here, it's a little more

2146
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
gradual as you go further

2147
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and further.

2148
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And we think that that's

2149
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
going to be good experience

2150
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
overall.

2151
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Um, because it's ultimately

2152
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
a lot of the materials you

2153
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
really want from the pit,

2154
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
you can gain by the time

2155
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
you're like doing like tier

2156
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,000
sixties.

2157
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
You start to get like little

2158
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
bits of the deethyron that

2159
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
you need to kind of start

2160
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
finishing off your masterwork

2161
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,000
items.

2162
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And then that gets more

2163
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and more efficient as you

2164
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
go deeper and deeper, you

2165
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
know, but there's a, but we

2166
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
do want to have these like

2167
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
really, really difficult

2168
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,000
challenges.

2169
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
We made a, we made a, a

2170
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
decision at the launch

2171
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
period of the game where we

2172
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
took nightmare dungeons,

2173
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
uh, difficulty, we kind of

2174
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
scaled it in a different

2175
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
way, you know, whereas

2176
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
like initially they were

2177
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
extremely challenging going

2178
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
up to tier 100 and we ended

2179
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
up making a reduction in

2180
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
their difficulty, uh, going

2181
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
into season one, uh, where

2182
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
we basically rebalanced

2183
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
things such that like the

2184
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
tier 75 old nightmare

2185
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
dungeon was the new tier 100

2186
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
nightmare dungeon and

2187
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
players no longer had that,

2188
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,000
like that measuring stick,

2189
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
that really, really difficult

2190
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
content anymore.

2191
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
We kind of take it away.

2192
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
We want that to still be

2193
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
there in the pit.

2194
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I mean, I think if tier

2195
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
200 is far beyond

2196
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
abattoir of zero 25,

2197
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
especially with some of

2198
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
like the balancing and the

2199
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
bug fixes to a lot of

2200
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
different builds, I

2201
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
actually, I don't know,

2202
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
maybe I'm wrong, but I

2203
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
expect that to be pretty

2204
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
challenging.

2205
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I don't think people are

2206
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,000
going to do that as a

2207
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
cakewalk.

2208
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Um, okay.

2209
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So we have eight minutes

2210
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,000
left.

2211
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm, I already cut off my

2212
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,000
timer.

2213
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
There's no way I can get

2214
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
to 99% of these

2215
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,000
questions.

2216
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So, uh, how do we feel

2217
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
about maybe doing a little

2218
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,000
rapid fire?

2219
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Let's do it.

2220
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Okay.

2221
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Sure.

2222
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah.

2223
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
This was talked about

2224
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
yesterday.

2225
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
If I remember correctly,

2226
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
this was the, so these are

2227
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
the top, top questions from

2228
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
YouTube.

2229
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So I promised I would ask

2230
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,000
them.

2231
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So here we go.

2232
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Um, this was the number one

2233
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
question by far, and it was

2234
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
touched on a little bit

2235
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,000
yesterday.

2236
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Is there an armory coming?

2237
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I heard yesterday.

2238
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I think you, if I quote you

2239
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
correctly, you said that

2240
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
armory is great.

2241
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
The team, the team likes it,

2242
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
had to prioritize some

2243
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
things.

2244
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Will an armory be coming to

2245
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Diablo four so we can save

2246
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,000
our builds?

2247
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Uh, it is.

2248
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah.

2249
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I mean, this is a problem

2250
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
that I think that, uh, that

2251
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
players have.

2252
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I think I've already

2253
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
mentioned that we're like,

2254
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
we're in the business of

2255
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
trying to like solve, uh,

2256
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
player problems.

2257
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Uh, it's a thing we're

2258
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
really excited about.

2259
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's a thing we, it's a

2260
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
thing we would like to do.

2261
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And that's all I can say

2262
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,000
right now.

2263
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
They're excited about it

2264
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
guys.

2265
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Okay.

2266
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Uh, there's lots of

2267
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
different ways to expand the

2268
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,000
game.

2269
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And as, uh, Joe put it

2270
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
yesterday, different slices

2271
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
of, of the pizza to give you

2272
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
power again from YouTube.

2273
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It seems like the most

2274
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
requested way that people

2275
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
would like to expand power or

2276
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
change their builds is to

2277
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
have this skill tree expanded.

2278
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Is that something that we can

2279
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
look forward to at some point

2280
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
coming to Diablo four is the

2281
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
team passionate about

2282
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
expanding the skill tree in

2283
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,000
multiple ways.

2284
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Maybe you'll even give us an

2285
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
ultimate button so we can get

2286
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
another skill.

2287
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You never know.

2288
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Uh, yeah, I'll, I'll take

2289
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
this one, I guess, unless

2290
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
you'll want to say some more.

2291
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Uh, I would say I have, we

2292
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
have nothing to announce

2293
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
about big updates to the

2294
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,000
skill tree.

2295
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It is a little bit more of a

2296
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
complicated problem because we

2297
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
want the skill tree to remain

2298
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
as an easy gateway for new

2299
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
players and returning players

2300
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
to come back and kind of know

2301
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
what that is.

2302
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And we didn't want the

2303
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
complexity and have to

2304
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,000
the depth of our game to be

2305
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
there.

2306
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So it comes with some nasty

2307
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
trade-offs that I'm not sure

2308
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
that we're willing to make, but

2309
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
we are open to the idea of

2310
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
adding some more depth to the

2311
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
skill tree, but we don't want

2312
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
it to be super complicated.

2313
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's not going to be the POE

2314
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
encyclopedia.

2315
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
We don't, we don't want that,

2316
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
at least not for our game.

2317
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
We want to be in crafting in

2318
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
other places.

2319
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yeah.

2320
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
If I could show like the,

2321
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
like seeing how different

2322
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
players, like, again, there's a

2323
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
lot of people who like this is

2324
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
their first Diablo game, like

2325
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
seeing what players did with the

2326
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
skill tree in testing.

2327
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah.

2328
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I think it would be very

2329
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
surprising to you and your

2330
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
audience.

2331
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
They take, they take all the

2332
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
generators and max them to five.

2333
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Absolutely.

2334
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Yeah.

2335
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And other things like that.

2336
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It's, it's a tougher problem.

2337
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I think a lot of people give it

2338
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
credit for.

2339
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And I don't know that the juice

2340
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
is worth the squeeze if we go

2341
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
too far, but hearing that people

2342
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
want more, we've heard that loud

2343
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
and clear, but nothing to announce

2344
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
in the near, in the immediate

2345
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,000
future.

2346
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Okay.

2347
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The next one for repeated and

2348
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
summoning content now and in the

2349
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
future of the game, are there

2350
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
plans to let people just resummon

2351
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
these bosses without resetting the

2352
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
instance?

2353
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Cause that eats up a lot of time

2354
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
for the people that do want to

2355
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
farm up a bunch of things and

2356
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
kill some bosses.

2357
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, this is a really, this is a

2358
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,000
really good idea.

2359
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
There's a lot of things that get

2360
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
cleaned up when a plate, when

2361
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
players reset a dungeon that makes

2362
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
it a lot easier for us to do this

2363
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
in the first place.

2364
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Let me take that back to the

2365
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,000
team.

2366
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I don't, I don't know that we've

2367
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
talked deeply about like exactly

2368
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
when we could deliver something

2369
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
like this, but we definitely see

2370
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
it as a, we definitely see it as

2371
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
a, something that you can

2372
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
improve.

2373
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So yeah, we'll, we'll take that

2374
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,000
back.

2375
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
All right.

2376
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Last one from YouTube here.

2377
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Will the campaign receive further

2378
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,000
attention?

2379
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So we'll, well, first of all,

2380
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
obviously probably the story

2381
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
continues with the expansion, but

2382
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
another way is currently when you

2383
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
start up a new season of Diablo,

2384
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
you can, you can go through the

2385
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
campaign again, if you want, or you

2386
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
can probably now go farm in

2387
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Helltide and the Helltide is going

2388
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
to level you a million times faster

2389
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
for a million, million more rewards.

2390
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's not close at all.

2391
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And some games let you force you to do

2392
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,000
the campaign.

2393
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Some games in Diablo 4, you don't

2394
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
have to.

2395
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Have you guys thought about maybe

2396
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
editing the campaign slightly for a

2397
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
replay, maybe taking out like the

2398
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
camel escort for, for example, and

2399
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
maybe benchmarking, oh, how long does

2400
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
it take to do a campaign just

2401
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
normally playing?

2402
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What is it?

2403
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Three hours for us?

2404
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I don't know what it would be.

2405
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And then benchmarking what it would

2406
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
be to do it in Helltide and kind of

2407
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
have them at the same point at the

2408
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
end of those journeys to allow

2409
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
players a real choice in how they

2410
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
want to start out their new season

2411
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
because the campaign was such a fan

2412
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
favorite on the launch and it was

2413
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
very well done.

2414
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Sure.

2415
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So I think if there is a, like the

2416
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
quest team has a lot of really cool

2417
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
ideas of things that you want to do

2418
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
to allow for players to like replay

2419
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
the campaign or to make it, to kind

2420
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
of edit it a little bit in some ways

2421
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
that you suggest.

2422
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I think that it's a thing that we're

2423
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
thinking about as we go.

2424
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But the, we know that we want to

2425
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
make sure that we are prioritizing

2426
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
the piece of the game that need

2427
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
work first, if that makes sense.

2428
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Like, I think that the idea of being

2429
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
able to replay a campaign is very,

2430
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,000
very exciting.

2431
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And I think there's really neat

2432
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
things we can do.

2433
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And we do have plans in the future

2434
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
for this stuff as well.

2435
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I don't want to like make it sound

2436
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
like we're not committing to

2437
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
anything here.

2438
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
We kind of do want to do something

2439
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,000
like this.

2440
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's just that there's a lot of

2441
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
other like replay features like

2442
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Helltide, for example, that we

2443
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
thought are, we're in a great

2444
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
position to like lift up and make

2445
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
feel like more exciting for

2446
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,000
players.

2447
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So that's been a more of a

2448
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,000
priority for us.

2449
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But I do think that there's

2450
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
opportunities there for sure.

2451
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Something there I want to point

2452
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
out, and this would help when the

2453
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
community is discussing things or

2454
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
when you even are with us, is this

2455
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
idea of opportunity cost.

2456
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I don't know if you know what,

2457
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
are you familiar with that term,

2458
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Rax?

2459
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah, economics.

2460
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Maybe not.

2461
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Give up something to gain

2462
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
something else.

2463
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Cool.

2464
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Then I don't have to explain it.

2465
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
But yeah, the opportunity cost

2466
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
comes very heavy into play when we

2467
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
talk about features and

2468
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
suggestions and things from

2469
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,000
players.

2470
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I think a lot of times it can be

2471
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
frustrating as a member of a

2472
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
community, because I'm a member of

2473
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
gaming communities too, so I know

2474
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
how it is.

2475
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm like, hey, you know, this

2476
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
thing, we obviously, it sounds like

2477
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
a good idea, and we all agree it's

2478
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,000
a good idea.

2479
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Why don't the devs do it right

2480
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,000
away?

2481
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And most of the time when that is

2482
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
true, it's because of opportunity

2483
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,000
costs.

2484
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's that the excited opportunity

2485
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
costs are something that you didn't

2486
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
realize makes it harder than it

2487
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
seems.

2488
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But opportunity costs, you know,

2489
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,000
here it's like, do we do loot

2490
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
reborn?

2491
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Do we redo how all the loot works in

2492
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
the game and your entire leveling

2493
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
experience with our updates to

2494
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Helltide?

2495
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Or do we make the campaign have

2496
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
parity with not doing campaign to

2497
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
level up, right?

2498
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Now, having campaign have parity to

2499
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
the non-campaign obviously is a good

2500
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
thing, but I would argue very

2501
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
heavily that loot being better in a

2502
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
loot-based game is more important

2503
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and impacts more people in a better

2504
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
way, in a more long-term way.

2505
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And then the list goes long and

2506
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
long, forever, forever of the

2507
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
things that you could do versus

2508
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
what you have to decide to do.

2509
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And then the other part, kind of

2510
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
alluding to your last question about

2511
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
resummoning bosses, is that I would

2512
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
say in that one, like, yeah,

2513
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
obviously good idea, better player

2514
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
experience.

2515
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
In there, I would say the reason why

2516
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
we're not doing it, just knowing how

2517
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
the game works a little bit more, is

2518
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
our game wasn't structured that way

2519
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
and we have to do a lot of things to

2520
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
make it structured that way.

2521
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And to actually do it is harder than

2522
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
most people would think, and that is

2523
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
why.

2524
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Both of these things are obviously good

2525
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
ideas that we would want.

2526
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
There's different reasons why we

2527
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
haven't done them yet.

2528
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Doesn't mean they won't happen, but

2529
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
it means that it's why they're not

2530
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
happening now or yet.

2531
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And that's a better way to frame it

2532
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
when people are talking to each other,

2533
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
because like, hey, what should the

2534
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Diablo X4 team do first or now?

2535
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Or hey, you know, maybe this is a

2536
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
little bit harder.

2537
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Could you explain why it's harder?

2538
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Would be a good question for an

2539
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
interviewer, for example, right?

2540
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Because then you're going to get

2541
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
actual insight into why rather than

2542
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,000
just complaining that it's not

2543
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
happening.

2544
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Are you providing Rack's feedback on

2545
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,000
this?

2546
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I mean, I might be giving feedback on

2547
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,000
feedback.

2548
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
That's part of my job too.

2549
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
But I like productive

2550
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
conversations is why.

2551
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And I think the community would

2552
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
rather have more productive

2553
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
conversations than their only

2554
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
avenues to complain and not know why

2555
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
things aren't working the way that

2556
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
they want.

2557
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I think people want to know how

2558
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,000
things work.

2559
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I think that makes sense.

2560
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I think they want to know how

2561
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
things work.

2562
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I want to educate people so that we

2563
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
can have better conversations about

2564
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
games.

2565
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I mean, I'm a loser, guys.

2566
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm always here.

2567
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
If you guys ever want to talk, which

2568
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
we're at

2569
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
we're actually at time.

2570
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I have one more.

2571
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,000
All right.

2572
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I mean, probably probably the the one

2573
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
that I I'm just going to ask a 15

2574
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
part question then to to abuse the one

2575
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
more.

2576
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I guess I love it.

2577
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Gamer at heart.

2578
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Probably probably the the most important

2579
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
one that's still left on the list is

2580
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
about social features.

2581
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So there I have three main topics of so I

2582
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
just I can't believe how many questions

2583
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I put here.

2584
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
That was so stupid of me.

2585
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I mean, there's no no chance at all.

2586
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Anyway, social features.

2587
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So the there's three main things

2588
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
trading, group finder, clans.

2589
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So with trading, what are your guys

2590
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
thoughts on putting an auction house

2591
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
esque type of thing just to allow

2592
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
trading and to avoid third party sites?

2593
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Obviously not a real money auction

2594
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
house.

2595
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
People are begging for a group finder.

2596
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I don't know why people have cooties.

2597
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I rather play by myself, but I guess

2598
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
people want it.

2599
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And then clans.

2600
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I understand.

2601
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I understand there's a big difficulty

2602
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
with clans, not just implementing them

2603
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
like they were implemented in Diablo

2604
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
three, but Diablo three clans mean

2605
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
absolutely nothing.

2606
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It's just a second friends list.

2607
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
There's no achievements to do.

2608
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
There's nothing to unlock.

2609
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
There's nothing to work toward.

2610
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But then if you put that in the game

2611
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
opportunity costs, the thing that the

2612
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
economic principle we keep talking

2613
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
about, then if you build that in the

2614
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
game, then people have to belong to a

2615
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
clan.

2616
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yep.

2617
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And otherwise they feel left out, which

2618
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
then leads me to another one of my

2619
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
million questions about SSF, but whatever.

2620
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So for social features, trading, group

2621
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
finder, clans.

2622
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
What are your guys' thoughts on those

2623
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
three for Diablo four?

2624
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Let's get going.

2625
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So for trading, okay.

2626
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Trading in season four, players can

2627
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
trade legendaries and uniques.

2628
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
They're still going to have to like go

2629
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
and actually meet up to do those

2630
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,000
trades.

2631
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
There's not going to be an automated

2632
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
trading function.

2633
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
There are things we're talking about

2634
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
with regards to like the trade chat

2635
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
channels, make it a little bit easier

2636
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
to navigate in terms of like creating

2637
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
like an actual auction house user

2638
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,000
interface.

2639
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's a thing a team has discussed.

2640
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's not a thing we've landed on.

2641
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
We really want to see what the reaction

2642
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
is from players in season four and what

2643
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
the experience is broadly for players in

2644
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
season four, how many players are

2645
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
actually trading, you know, because I

2646
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
imagine there's going to be, it'll be

2647
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
different for different types of

2648
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,000
players, right?

2649
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
But I think there could potentially be

2650
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
room for an investment there because

2651
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
we don't want to just push players

2652
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
just to like third party sites.

2653
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But we were at a point where we're

2654
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
like, well, do we really want to like

2655
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
go and make a whole, it would be a

2656
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
opportunity cost would be a big

2657
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
investment to go make an auction

2658
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
house for Diablo four, for example,

2659
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
without knowing exactly what the desire

2660
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
for it is going to be.

2661
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And we didn't want to like wait to like

2662
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
let some of these things be tradable

2663
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,000
in the meantime.

2664
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So that's the HALA version.

2665
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
We're not opposed to it.

2666
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
We want to see how things go in season

2667
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
four for the, with regards to the

2668
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
like group finder, I think is the way

2669
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,000
that you call it.

2670
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
We do want to make sure that there are

2671
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
easier systems for players to use to

2672
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
find parties of players who are doing

2673
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
things that interest them.

2674
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We do have a social team on Diablo four.

2675
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
They've been thinking about clan stuff,

2676
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
things like this, things to make

2677
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
socialization more easy between

2678
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
players.

2679
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I think there'll be exciting stuff to

2680
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
share in the future.

2681
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So there's things we're thinking

2682
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,000
about.

2683
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And there are, and then with regards to

2684
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
the last one, clans, of course,

2685
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,000
clans.

2686
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Uh, we also have ideas of things

2687
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
we want to do to update parts of the

2688
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
clan functionality to make it just a

2689
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
little more engaging to give more

2690
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
purpose to parts of clans.

2691
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You know, this is a thing that we are,

2692
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
we have designs for and things we're

2693
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,000
thinking about.

2694
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I can't announce anything today.

2695
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Just to say that we recognize there's some

2696
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
parts of social features in Diablo four

2697
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
that can be leveled up, made better.

2698
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And there's process we see players going

2699
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
through as part of regular play in

2700
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
seasons that we want to make easier,

2701
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
more streamlined for them.

2702
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Well, I, I gotta be honest.

2703
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It was, it was actually an honor to have

2704
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,000
you guys come here.

2705
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I really like you guys.

2706
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I love the Diablo franchise since I was

2707
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,000
a kid.

2708
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
This actually meant a lot to me.

2709
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Um, I have a million more, I have a

2710
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
million more questions, but I know we're

2711
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,000
out of time.

2712
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Want to be respectful of that.

2713
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Thank you guys.

2714
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Thank you guys for coming here and, uh,

2715
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
speaking so open and honestly, I'm a

2716
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
loser.

2717
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I'm always here.

2718
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
If you guys want to go again, I mean,

2719
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
you guys got three, three free hours.

2720
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Uh, I, I got a lot more questions, but

2721
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I guess who's, is DM going next or I can

2722
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
just pass along a million more.

2723
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm sure they're, I believe so.

2724
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah.

2725
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm on with them.

2726
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Yeah.

2727
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,000
All right.

2728
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's been a blast.

2729
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It's been super fun.

2730
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Thank you.

2731
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I really appreciate it.

2732
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Um, I will say we're trying to get in

2733
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
front of the community a little bit

2734
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
more and talk about these things.

2735
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It's something that I, I really like

2736
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
doing and I'm pretty passionate about

2737
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
and I'm looking forward to doing more.

2738
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
So thank you guys for being here.

2739
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,000

Hell yeah.

2741
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Let's do it again.

2742
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Thank you guys.

2743
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
