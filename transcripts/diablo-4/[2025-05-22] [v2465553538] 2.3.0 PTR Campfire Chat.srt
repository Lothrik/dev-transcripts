1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
this stuff. Herodric spells, all new this season, and the team has put so much love, so much energy

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
into designing all of this. We're so excited. I can't wait to tell you about it, which I'm going

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to do right now in this overview section, starting with these bullet points. So several spell

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
components. That doesn't do it justice. We have 30 different components you're going to be able to

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
combine together. That's a lot of choice. And you're going to basically be building your own

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
spell. What does that mean? We're going to get into it. And the last bullet point, unique utility.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Again, what does that mean? It means a lot. This is a pretty intricate system. These spells are not

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
just like, oh, what one does the most damage, right? It's a lot about like, what kind of functionality

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
do I want with these skills? And you can really customize it exactly how you want. Yeah, the

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
possibilities are endless. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. In previous seasons, like in season eight, you get

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the power from the boss. And that is the one thing that you have. And that's the visual component.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But like you said, you build these Herodic spells. Like you get to pick the different things you want

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
to put together, which is really cool. Exactly. Yeah. It's so cool. With that said, let's just hop

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
into it. Let's start digging into what these are. All right. So right here, what we are looking at

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is a catalyst. And a catalyst, for those that don't know, which probably most of you don't know,

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
is the foundation of your spell. This is what gives it its form and its function. And as you can see,

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
there is already so much depth here. It has a lucky hit chance. It has its own cooldown. It has a rank 10

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
bonus. And it does a really cool effect that isn't just damage. Each one of these, they do something

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
unique that you're going to love to play around with. And there are multiple of these.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So how do we trigger the catalysts in the first place? How do we get those going?

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That is a good question. There's even a lot of depth when it comes to that system.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And I think the next slide is actually going to be the best thing to convey that.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
All right. So what we are looking at right here is the seasonal interface for Herodic spellcraft.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And if you look, you will see that there is actually a bar right there on the UI that kind

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
of mimics your action bar interface. And if you notice, when the catalyst got placed into the slot,

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
the action bar skill now has a purple blinking border around it. What does that mean? It means

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that your catalyst is now bound to that action bar skill. And that's where the cooldown comes in,

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
right? Yep. That's where the cooldown comes in. The cooldown is the limiter. So you're not just

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
going to always be able to press that button and make your catalyst fire off. Right. It's beholden

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
to its cooldown. But thankfully, ranking up does lower the cooldown. So you're going to get more and

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
more frequent use out of these catalysts as you rank them up and make them more powerful.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Excellent. Yeah. So that's what's going on in this interface. Let's see what happens when this rogue

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
presses the button with Celestial Surge equipped.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay. Yeah, that's awesome. You see, that does most of the talking for itself.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So basically what just happened is that the rogue threw the smoke bomb and the smoke bomb was the

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
guiding factor for the catalyst. And the catalyst created that arcanic horadric rune on the ground

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
right where the smoke bomb landed. It did its pull in effect. And then that barrage of stars just

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
started doing their work randomly all over that area. What do you guys think? Is that pretty cool?

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's pretty neat. And that's only like one of the possible combinations, right? Because like

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you have one catalyst there and you assigned it to a specific skill, but you could pick any of the

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
catalysts and you could assign it to any of the skills that your class has available to it.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And the way that the catalyst interacts changes based on the kind of skill you're using, right?

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Exactly. So think of it like an extension of your skills. You know, it's going to feel very natural

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and organic as you're, what's the term, invoking these into combat. So yeah, go ahead.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I really like how you get to choose like when you deploy this in combat, right? If you want it on

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
smoke bomb, it's like, okay, I want to be CCing an enemies or like, I know there's a clump of enemies

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
there so I can deploy this at a key time. Or if I like don't want to think about it too much, like I just,

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I just want it to happen as much as possible, right? I'll just put it on my core skill that I'm

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
pressing all the time and it'll happen like as often as it can. And like you get that choice

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
in how you want to deploy these. Exactly. And like I said, it's going to feel natural.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you're a Sorc and you put it on flame shield, it's going to summon on your character.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you're using a ranged ability, it's going to go where the ranged ability lands.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you're using a melee skill, it's going to be in melee range on the character you hit.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's just going to feel like what you would expect it to be.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So the catalyst just really flows around however you want to integrate it into your

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
play style effectively. Exactly. We don't want to spoil all of the catalysts. We want you to

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
experience them on the PTR, but we do have one more for you to look at right now that's really

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
cool. So let's go to that tooltip. So this is the Cosmic Anomaly. This is a summons type. We know

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
players love summons. It's going to scale off summon damage bonuses naturally because it has the tag.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It has a passive and an active component. For those of you familiar with Druid Companions,

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
this is going to feel really natural to you. It's that same kind of setup.

62
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I'm not even going to mention the rank 10, but it's pretty insane. Like just if you read it,

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
that's a powerful effect. So when you reach that threshold, you are unlocking a whole new realm of

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
power for your catalyst. And yeah, let's go see what this looks like. What does it look like in game?

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, shiny. So shiny. Look at that. Very lightning-y. Very lightning-y. Yeah, that's a...

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There it goes. That's a real word, right? Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I'm going to say this.

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, I love this clip. Oh, that's so satisfying. Okay. That's also a little heartless. I can't

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
believe the necromancer would do that. Those are your friends and you just send them to go explode?

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Unbelievable. But good news, they come back. Your friends come back. So you can go send them over

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
to explode. They do their thing. And then they always return to you. Yeah. So the thing I really

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
love about this clip in particular is that the necromancers chosen this catalyst and assigned

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
it to Bone Prison, which is very clever because they also have a pull-in with corpse tendrils.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And so what they do is they pull everything in with corpse tendrils and then cast Bone Prison,

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
which invokes the cosmic anomalies and kills all of them while they're stuck all together inside the

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Bone Prison. Exactly. Well said. There's so many satisfying combinations for you to discover.

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
However, we're going to leave it there, but let me tell you the amount of depth in this system

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
is so fun. We've had so much fun playtesting this internally. Oh, yeah, yeah. I've been playing

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
it quite a bit in the last couple of minutes or however long. And apparently I lose track of

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
time while I'm doing it. No, it's great. I love it. This is just such an awesome addition to the game.

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah. Like, honestly, I've got to say, I did write the 230 PTR blog. I hope you all like it.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But this is definitely a system like going in and testing it out before to then help write the blog.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was like, the blog is not going to cut it in terms of listing on all the different tools.

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Like the way all the different aspects of the Horadix Spellcraft interface together,

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it's really something that you need to go in and playtest yourself because of all the different

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
combinations, all the way the different powers interface with each other. It's very hard to get

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
on paper. So it's really something you got to go in and test for yourselves. It's a ton of fun.

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can. Right. Yeah. And you get that opportunity. How about that? Exactly. Going forward,

88
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
we have something cool to show you. So we've talked a lot about catalysts. Now let's talk about

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
infusions. This is another thing you can socket into your Horadric interface. And this is going to

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
change the damage type, the elemental damage that your catalyst deals. And it doesn't just stop there.

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The damage type has mechanics attached to it that change its function too. So what would you expect

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
fire to do? Like fire is destructive. It's really, you know, it's, it's all consuming. So naturally it's

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
going to destroy enemy structures. What does that mean? I'm not going to tell you, but you're going to,

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
well, you're, maybe you're going to see it in just a moment actually, but I'm not going to tell you for

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
this time right now. And fire also creates burning areas on the ground that will damage enemies that you

96
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
keep in that area. And it doesn't stop there. I'm sorry. There's so much depth on these items and

97
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
there are five of them, right? So you have so much choice, but also while it's equipped,

98
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
your fire damage bonus is equal to that of your highest damage type bonus. What does that mean?

99
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah. So even if you're like playing like a frost sorcerer who just has like a lot of frost

100
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
damage or cold damage, right? You can still use this and it kind of benefits from all of your,

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
your cold damage because all of the, um, the elemental damage types kind of get,

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
get equalized here. So I could be, for example, a frost sorc and I just have copious amounts of

103
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
frost damage bonus, right? It's just, it's, it's flowing everywhere. I have too much of it.

104
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I swap in the poison infusion and then suddenly I have an equal amount of poison damage bonus.

105
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's really cool because my poison catalyst is going to be hitting like a truck and players love

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
dealing lots of damage, right? I love it. But also, and tell me if this is cool when you guys get in,

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
get to play test with it, the possibilities expand even more because now I'm a sorc that has a lot

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
of poison damage and a real visage. Like, do I want to throw that on my helmet now? I don't know.

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I've never really had that, that kind of build crafting opportunity, that kind of build crafting

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
opportunity. So there's so much there. Uh, just can't wait to see everyone's reaction when you'll

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
play with it. And so just to make sure I get this right. Um, I have my catalyst. That's what we see

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
visually in these clips here, like those cosmic anomalies. And we just talked about infusions

113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and infusions change the elemental damage type specifically of my catalyst, right?

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Correct. Yep. Okay. So as you're seeing right here, he's swapping out the lightning gem with a fire

115
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
gem. And now look at them. They're all fiery. They have smoldering flames and watch this when they

116
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
combust, look at it. There's a burning patch on the ground and you can get multiple of those.

117
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It isn't just always going to be one. Uh, this is destruction incarnate, right? This is,

118
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
this is cool. Oh yeah. Yeah. And each infusion has like their own secondary, uh, damaging or,

119
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
or just not necessarily damaging, but just a fact that they apply as well. And in fire's case,

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
it's the burning. Yeah. It is layers on top of layers, right? Um, so again, we're so excited,

121
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
uh, for people that were closely reading that tool tip on the infusion page, you might've seen

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
a rank five bonus, um, even more depth. We keep talking about depth that rank, that rank five bonus.

123
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We're going to get into it right now. Uh, basically it allows you to deactivate monster affixes

124
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
depending on the damage type you are using. So what would you expect fire to deactivate? Well,

125
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it makes sense that thematically it would deactivate chilling winds. Those are those like icy winds that

126
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
monsters can summon in. They like slow your projectiles. Yeah. So annoying. No one likes being slow.

127
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I was just playing a, yeah, I was playing a blood spear necromancer season eight and the chilling winds

128
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
were so annoying. Oh yeah. So let's look at a clip and see, uh, chilling winds being deactivated.

129
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So this is a different catalyst than we've seen before, right? This one draws like a damaging beam.

130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah. So this is disintegrate. It is another catalyst. We're not going to show you the tool tip about all

131
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
its possibilities and what it does, but yeah, you'll see that the moment he deactivates the monster,

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
those chilling winds just disappear and they will stay disappeared as long as they are, you know,

133
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
consistently deactivated. Uh, so as you know, this is going to be very satisfying to use. Like you're going

134
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
to be able to swap these in and if certain, uh, monster affixes just ruin your day and you really

135
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
dislike them, well, they're just gone like that. Uh, and we have one more clip to show you.

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yep. So, oh, okay. There we go. The waller wall is just gone. Uh, this is also fire because I talked

137
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
about structures. Um, that's waller walls. That is lightning totems. Those like things that arc lightning

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
damage, the red lightning damage all around the arena, that is tether points. Those things that

139
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
like chain you to the ground fire destroys all of those. Uh, so we're going to leave it at that.

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We hope you really have fun playing around with that. Yeah. No more wallers. Yeah. Yeah. If you hate wallers,

141
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
your problems have, your prayers have been answered. That's great. Yeah. I mean, that's super handy because

142
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
now if you're going into a nightmare dungeon, there's particular monster ethics, you can just slap in

143
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
whichever, uh, whichever infusion you need and then you're, you won't have to deal with it.

144
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Exactly. Exactly. Um, so yeah, there's going to be so much choice here to like swap things on the fly

145
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and react to things to kind of suit your play style. And that's really cool. That's really exciting.

146
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Uh, but wait, there is more. We have more in this system for you. Actually, we have three more socket

147
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
spaces of things you have to think about while you are designing your spell. So let's get into that.

148
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So we have arcana arcana are going to be dropping in seasonal content randomly in the released version

149
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
of this season, but on PTR, we're just going to be giving it to you. So you'll be able to play around

150
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
with all of them, but arcana are like, think of them like the tuning knobs for your powers. Uh, these are

151
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
small, subtle effects that when you add three of them, they really kind of tailor the power, uh, the catalyst

152
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
to your play style. Yeah. So we have, okay, so let's recap again, really quick. Yeah. We have

153
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
the catalyst, which is the visual effect. We have the infusion, which determines the catalyst's

154
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
elemental type and gives it fancy bells and whistles. And then we have the arcana, which even modifies it

155
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
further. And like we saw there, like you could make it bigger or you could give yourself a buff when

156
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
you use your catalyst and that kind of stuff. Exactly. So like, let me just walk you through

157
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
these three arcana right here. So, uh, I picked these three because, uh, they're kind of, they kind of

158
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
show off different reasons you might use an arcana. So starting on the left side with gleaming conduit,

159
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
it increases the effect size of your catalyst. Uh, what does that mean? Let's go back to the first

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
catalyst we showed off. It was the celestial surge where you had the stars raining from the sky.

161
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Uh, that's a randomized pattern, right? That's a bit of a downside, but with this placed into the socket,

162
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
suddenly those stars are creating bigger impacts when they land on the ground. Right. Meaning by swapping

163
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
in this, uh, arcana, you are overcoming a bit of that downside and you are making that damage more

164
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
consistent and just more overall impactful. Yep. And that's just going to apply differently to each

165
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
catalyst. Yeah. Uh, for tranquil stone, I'm actually just going to throw this over the Charles.

166
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Charles, what class might be happy about this arcana? I mean, you know, I've heard some classes,

167
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
necromancer, talking about how they don't have too many options for unstoppable. Well, now you have

168
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
many, many options, uh, five different catalyst options and tons of different ways to invoke

169
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
it, um, to gain that unstoppable. So, you know, necromancers, uh, look out for that tranquil stone.

170
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Exactly. Yeah. So this, again, this kind of goes to that philosophy of these will kind of fill in holes.

171
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh my gosh. One sec. Okay. Technical difficulty aside, I can hear again, uh, tranquil stone will

172
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
basically, uh, overcome some downsides of your class. It will, you know, fill in the holes and allow you to

173
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
come certain, overcome things you lack. And that's really cool. And then potent alloy. Alloy?

174
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Alloy. Alloy. Alloy. Okay. I pronounced it correctly. Potent alloy. Uh, we talked about how infusions

175
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
interact with monster affixes. You're even going to find some arcana in the mix that will also

176
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
additionally interact with even more monster affixes. Right. So if that really suits your play style,

177
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
feel free to, uh, place those in, but wait, there's a little bit more we're getting there,

178
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
but there's a little bit more, uh, there are also legendary arcana. And when we think about

179
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
legendary arcana, we're not really thinking about pure player power. We're thinking about the,

180
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
how hard they are to understand the depth of them, right? There's just a lot going on. And what do I

181
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
mean by that? So there are five legendary arcana that you can discover out there. And as you see

182
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
in this slide right here, we have nightmare orb, but if you look at it, it changes what's going on.

183
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So let's start on the left side. So on the left side, your nightmare orb is speaking to the cosmic

184
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
anomaly, uh, catalyst from before. Oh, yeah. And it adjusts its effect to match it. So when you put this

185
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
on your pet summons catalyst, suddenly they're going to have this little aura around them where

186
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
when, as they run into enemies, they're going to fear and slow them. Uh, but if we go to the right

187
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
side, the nightmare orb is talking to celestial surge and this does a completely different effect. It's

188
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
going to fear unaffected enemies. But once the fear ends, you have a chance to create even more stars.

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So these legendary arcanas care about each individual catalyst then? Yep. Exactly. So the same

190
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
legendary arcana has five different variations, uh, to wrap your head around. And there are five of

191
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
these. So five times five, I'm going to say the keyword one more time. I'm sorry. That's a lot of depth.

192
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So I feel like you've just presented to me and us a unfathomable amount of combinatorics, Liam.

193
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Uh, my earpiece has fallen out now like five times. So the funny thing is,

194
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
if you guys remember from last stream, Adam's earpiece was falling out all the time. Yeah.

195
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We actually changed that and I got the souped up earpiece. So this, this baby that's locked in,

196
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
we're going to be getting those for the rest of the stream. So as Liam struggles, I benefit.

197
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm good for like a minute and then it's probably going to fall out again. Actually, I already feel

198
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
falling out. Don't worry about it. Instead, we have some really cool video content to show you. While the

199
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
rest of us just talk broadly about this system and why we're so excited. So, uh, everybody,

200
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
the floor is open. What is your favorite combination? What are you the most excited about

201
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
when it comes to these, uh, spells? Yeah, I really think that, um, I love, uh, finding ways to get my

202
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
ultimate cool down really low so that I can trigger it on my ultimate, uh, constantly. Uh, it kinds of

203
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
mixes really, really well. Just playing like an ultimate build in general. It's really fun.

204
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah, I've got a soft spot for summons. I really love the cosmic anomaly. I love, uh, just having a

205
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
bunch of guys out there, even if they're floaty, glowy orbs of elemental destruction, um, and love

206
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
commanding them and having them go and explode. That's, that's just really fun for me.

207
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah, I've been a big fan of playing barb lately, but I find when I get into the higher torment tiers,

208
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
you're just like so up and close and taking damage that it, it, the survivability does get a bit more

209
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
difficult. So like having the ability to use some more like ranged abilities to then throw, uh, my spellcraft out and then kind of

210
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
do some CC while I am like an up close and personal player. And like, I'll probably play a rogue next

211
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
season too. So in a similar vein, like being able to kind of like still have those, uh, damaging abilities

212
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
that are, you know, will do damage over distance while being able to like, you know, go heel in the corner.

213
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's nice to just like influence those play styles.

214
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah, definitely. So again, so much content here. We are unbelievably excited for you guys to get into the

215
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
PTR and try these out. Yeah. Uh, again, we've had so much fun play testing them and we can't wait to

216
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
see what everyone thinks about it. I feel like I got into a state where like I was play testing

217
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Herodric spellcraft and I was like, the time just started slipping away. Cause like, I just started

218
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
being like, well, what if I like did this kind of list with this infusion and then apply it to this skill?

219
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, and now this Arcana matters and that just have happened again and again and again. It's just so much

220
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
fun to play with. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a really, really intricate system. Um, I just want to

221
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
throw it to Aislinn and I get to say one more thing. Do it. There's more.

222
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
There's more. There's already enough, Liam. Yeah. You think we need more?

223
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah. You want to throw a whole another layer on top of this, Liam? You crazy man.

224
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Well, yes, uh, you are correct. There is more. There are, uh, Herodric jewels. Uh, Herodric jewels are what you

225
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
might be reminded by, uh, well, you might be reminded, um, excuse me, I can speak English.

226
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Uh, occult gems from season seven. Uh, they are very similar to occult gems from season seven.

227
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We have a lot of similar effects on Herodric jewels that you might have seen from season seven

228
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
occult gems, but we've added lots of new shiny layers of paint and, and glorious effects, uh, to

229
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
these Herodric jewels. And we've also really brought them in and, um, both aesthetically and mechanically

230
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
unified them with Herodric spellcraft. Uh, so what you're going to be doing is you're going to be

231
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
finding these Herodric jewels through tomes starting in Torment one. Um, so once you actually

232
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
get to the end game, you'll start finding the ability to, uh, craft these Herodric jewels. You can

233
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
then, once you've found the tome, uh, take it to a crafting station and actually craft it with the

234
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
seasonal currency Herodric files and gem fragments. And don't worry, it's not as many gem fragments as

235
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
occult gems. If, if you have a PTSD from that, like I do, it was a lot. Um, and yeah, you can

236
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
then just socket them into your jewelry sockets and just pump up your build even further. And what our

237
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
first example here is liminal echo, which you might actually recognize, uh, as an occult gem, uh, in

238
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
terms of a cheat death, but we have reflavored it and rethemed it and changed its mechanics to actually

239
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
invoke propulsion, which is a different one of the catalysts that we didn't actually show here, but you

240
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
will, you will see that in the PTR. Uh, and it makes you invulnerable and then it has an ICD.

241
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Um, but yeah, we have way more, uh, Herodric jewels than just that. There are 15 total. They all do

242
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
lots of crazy different stuff. So we're going to go over some of our favorite here is just to give

243
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
you guys a sneak peek. Uh, so the first one is Tyrant Bane. You can look over that text there and you

244
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
might think to yourself, is this Bane of the Stricken? And the answer would be, yes, it is. If you are a D3

245
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
enjoyer, it is Bane of the Stricken for dot builds. I'm very personally excited about that one. Uh, the

246
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
second one we have is the Starflux. This one is fantastic. Uh, it's just punch you in the teeth,

247
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
straight value, double your catalyst damage. That's a lot of damage though. So if you do want to do that,

248
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
you're probably going to lose control of your Herodric spellcraft to some degree, which causes your

249
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
catalysts to inherit their infusions randomly. So you don't actually get to determine or decide rather,

250
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
how that's going to happen. And then finally we have idle from below. You may also recognize this

251
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
effect from occult gems, but with a twist. Uh, and you, I mean the twist is, it's, it's probably fine.

252
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I, yeah, and jeweled guardians, I bet they're pushovers, but don't worry about it. No, no, no,

253
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
don't worry about it. No, yeah, no. Focus on the first line for that one. That's the important part.

254
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Right, Mary, of course, that max life, unhindered. Great stuff. Absolutely. Nothing else to worry about.

255
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
For sure. For sure. All right. And, uh, I think we have a video of the Starflux to kind of give you a sense of what that is

256
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
like. So this is the cosmic anomaly, uh, catalyst with the Starflux equipped. And you might notice

257
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
that they have different infusions applied to them because it's determined randomly each time

258
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
a new cosmic anomaly comes out. Uh, and this can be really actually interesting because Liam, to your

259
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
point before, uh, different infusions deal with different enemy of fixes. So if you have the Starflux

260
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
equipped and cosmic anomalies, you might actually be able to deal with a bunch of different enemy

261
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
effects simultaneously, which is pretty cool. Exactly. And just look at that kaleidoscopic

262
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
explosion, right? Yeah. So satisfying. It's so beautiful. Absolutely. And we have, uh, like I

263
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
said, we have 15 Horadric jewels and all of them do various wacky, amazing, cool stuff. Uh, so while

264
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
you're experimenting with Horadric spellcraft and trying out all of the new things in season nine,

265
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
slot some of those in and see what kind of madness you can accomplish. Yeah. Not gonna lie,

266
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Chad was pretty excited about the, uh, the Horadric jewels. And like the Starflux, it looks absolutely

267
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
not yet. I'm really, really pumped to test it out. Uh, a few call-outs for everyone, uh, uh,

268
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
watching as well. We will have a Q and A towards the end of the stream. So if you do have any

269
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
questions for our development team, any questions for Dan, like what's the best way to make poutine

270
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
gravy from scratch, you know, he's your guy for it. Um, so we will have that towards the end of

271
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the stream. So drop your questions in chat. We do have community members, um, pulling those. And again,

272
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
like we want your feedback. This, that was a ton of information, a ton of systems. And we actually do

273
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
have specific things that we're looking for in terms of what we're seeking for each,

274
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
uh, for each bit, uh, bit and component going in the two through PTR. Yeah, that's true. Like,

275
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
you know, uh, I guess I'll speak specifically to Horadric, uh, jewels. Got to make sure I get the

276
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
terms right. Um, yeah. So we want to hear what you guys think about all the different Horadric jewels.

277
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
We want to know, like, do these effects feel correct? This is the perfect time, uh, to give feedback on

278
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
just straight up bouncing. Does this give you enough bonus damage? Does this give you too much bonus

279
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
damage? Does this feel good? Does it not feel good? Uh, are the jewel guardians, uh,

280
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't worry about them. Yeah. Don't give us feedback on that part.

281
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Maybe you should worry about them, you know? Maybe they need to get a little too stuck.

282
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah, yeah. But yeah, just, yeah, let us know about, uh, Horadric jewels. And of course,

283
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm sure you'd love to hear your thoughts about it. Definitely. For Horadric spells,

284
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
please just let us know how it feels both in early and late game. I know, uh, it's PTR. A lot of people

285
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
are going to be mainly jumping into the late game, but early game is also really helpful. We want them to feel

286
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
really cool and satisfying to use in all realms of content. Uh, we also just want to know about

287
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the effects themselves. Are they satisfying? Does anything feel off? Uh, do we need to like tighten

288
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
up cooldowns or things like that? Just get into the weeds with it. We will definitely be reading

289
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
through as much as we can and making these spells the best they can be for launch.

290
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yep. Now's the time to get that feedback. Tune those knobs. It's the, it's the best time to do it.

291
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And for everyone, uh, watching from home, we also will have the D4 patch notes and the blog

292
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
hitting after the stream. So if there's anything you missed on the stream, um, that will be available

293
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
for you to read in depth and disseminate over the weekend before you jump into the PTR.

294
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Um, but I know one of the biggest parts of the patch notes, uh, has to do with class balance.

295
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And we do have some, Charles, you got a lot to talk about today.

296
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I got some notes here. We got lots to talk about, you know, kind of teed it up at the start of the stream,

297
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
how we kind of think about class balance currently. Um, but of course it's, it's an ever changing

298
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
process and we always want to be giving, you know, new things to play with new ways to play Diablo 4.

299
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And, uh, so there's lots of updates, uh, this season, um, with that in mind.

300
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah. Uh, so let's get into, uh, some of the, the changes that affect all classes in some way

301
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
before getting into each individual class and talk about some of the new stuff coming for them.

302
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
These are kind of, uh, changes that are, are global or, or affect everybody. Uh, so first up, you know,

303
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Overpower has been overpowered for a while. We should have seen that coming, uh, with the name. Oops.

304
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oops. Um, yeah, it has been, uh, really like just one of the strongest things you can be doing across

305
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
any class for the past, um, handful of seasons now. And, uh, so we're, we're definitely taking a big swing

306
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
at it here in season nine. Um, so Overpower's initial design philosophy was, it was supposed to be, um, a, a,

307
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
a stat that tankier kind of builds, uh, things that have like, um, that strong defensive fantasy,

308
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
things like Werebear, Barbarians, Blood Necro, could, could build these defensive stats like max

309
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
health and fortify and convert that into offensive power. Uh, that's the initial design conception of

310
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
it. And which is why whenever you did Overpower, you got bonus damage in a, um, based on the amount

311
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
of maximum life and fortify that your character had. This ended up being a lot because it was kind

312
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
of tied to the, uh, like ratio of how much you, of health you already had. Uh, I don't want to get

313
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
too deep into the, the math here, but basically, uh, it was a lot of additive damage. Uh, so it would

314
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
be the equivalent of you having like plus a thousand or more percent damage on your gear when you

315
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
overpowered. And that led to Overpower's being extremely strong, far more than say Critical Strike,

316
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
for instance. And even dominating builds that originally weren't intended to like benefit

317
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
from that so much. Yeah, we, we saw just every class was trying to Overpower because it was so

318
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
valuable. Yeah. Um, probably also didn't help that it's already so good to just stack max life,

319
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
right? So it was like, you're doing a ton of damage and you're doing the right thing by stacking

320
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Max life because it's so potent, right? So yeah, it was very dominant for that reason. Right. And so in

321
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
this season, in season nine, we're going to be making an update to that additive portion, the additive

322
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
damage that you get from the overpower, that messy behind the scenes formula that you would get,

323
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
essentially reducing it by 80%. So if you used to get, you know, a thousand percent bonus damage

324
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
there, it's only going to be 200, um, here in the PTR. Uh, the, uh, it still gives a multiplicative

325
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
bonus just like Critical Strikes because it's still rare. It's still, you need to work to get your

326
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
overpowers online just like Critical Strikes. Um, so it's still going to be powerful. Overpowering is

327
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
still going to be better than not doing it. Um, but it won't be so infinitely far ahead like we've

328
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
seen it. Uh, we definitely want a lot of feedback on this because we know it's been, uh, you know,

329
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
the real big talking point of a lot of different, uh, meta builds right now feels like you need to,

330
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
uh, work on overpower. Um, that's not the intent. We don't want everybody to feel like you have to do it

331
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
all the time in order to optimize your damage. So we definitely want to make sure that we open up

332
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the possibilities to other, uh, classes. Um, kind of tied in with that, the additive damage rebalance.

333
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So, uh, that's, that's the base power of overpower we talked about. Um, another contributing factor

334
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
was that whenever you got overpowered damage on your items, it was just overstatted. You know,

335
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
we, we balanced those initially when, um, earlier on in the game's lifetime when we had a different

336
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
estimate of how often players would be overpowering or doing any of these kinds of conditional effects,

337
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
like critical strike or dot damage or, or what have you. Um, so we've done kind of a comprehensive

338
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
pass on items, uh, the base affixes that, that show up, uh, this, this season and said, okay,

339
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
critical strike damage. We're going to give you an equivalent amount of critical strike damage

340
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and overpower damage if it appears in the same spot. Uh, previously it was something like you would

341
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
get a one handed weapon and it would literally have almost 200% overpower damage and ancestral,

342
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and it would give like 55% critical strike damage. And that's just way too different,

343
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
right? Like that was one reason like, well, why would I build crit damage when I can build

344
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
overpower and get four times the benefit? Uh, so we're, we're looking to re-normalize that and kind

345
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
of, uh, establish a better baseline of comparison of these stats against each other. Um, this affects

346
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
everybody in some way as you're building, um, your items, you're going to be looking for different

347
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
stats. There's just the, the numerical values will be different there, but we think it, it gets into a much

348
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
better state for allowing you to go, you know, for vulnerable damage, for crit damage, for summons

349
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,000
damage and not feel like you're doing it wrong because it wasn't overpower, right? Um, next we've

350
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
got a basic skill buff. Um, there's, there's a lot of things that affect every class this season.

351
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah. Um, so talking about basic skills, um, this is kind of an initiative where we are starting here to,

352
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
to really comprehensively look at all of the skills in the game and look at their relative balance,

353
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
against each other. And, um, you know, sometimes we've had some basic skills which just, you know,

354
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
do negative damage. You think like you're healing the enemies by attacking because it's so weak.

355
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah. And other ones that you can actually like really build, um, a full kind of basic skill build

356
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
around because it has a lot of support, has good base damage, has whatever effects. Um, we've done a

357
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
comprehensive pass on every single basic skill in the game and, and retuned them. And when I say retuned,

358
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I say double or triple their damage output for the most part. Um, literally skills that used to do

359
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
like 20% of your weapon damage now do like 60 or 80%, uh, just, just massive increases on every single

360
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
basic skill in the game. Now, um, that's to help them kind of compete kind of right out of the box.

361
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You get a basic skill, you press the button, it feels impactful. That's the goal. Um, we do want still

362
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
basic skill, um, oriented builds in the late game to, to exist. But of course, if we just tripled or,

363
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
um, their damage output, uh, that would cause some of them to be kind of way too good on, on some ends.

364
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yes. So we have, uh, adjusted some of the, uh, the scalers that you see on some of the legendary

365
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and unique items that talk to, uh, basic skills in particular, brought them down a little bit.

366
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
We still want them to be, uh, competitive and probably better this season than they have been in the past.

367
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Uh, but we're just, um, you know, we're not trying to triple every single basic skill. We want to make

368
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
sure that it, it, uh, smooths out that progression. Right. Um, I will say that this is, uh, you know,

369
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
we, we looked at basic skills here in this season. It's, uh, an initiative where we're going to be

370
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
looking at other categories of skills and in future seasons. So definitely keep an eye on, uh, similar

371
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
kinds of, uh, comprehensive balance passes, uh, for, for future seasons as they come down. So your feedback

372
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
on exactly how we landed on this basic skill pass, uh, is really helpful to help inform like,

373
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
hey, is our, is our methodology or comparison, uh, right. Uh, and we're, we're the tuning on these,

374
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:23,000
um, accurate. Uh, next up maximum resistance. This is a, a, a relatively quicker point. Um, so right now on,

375
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,000
uh, on live, if you, uh, your maximum resistance for every element is capped at 70%. Now on the PTR,

376
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
it'll be capped at 75% baseline. So everyone can get a little bit more resistance. Um, the absolute cap

377
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
is still 85 if you get some maximum resistance effects. Uh, but the baseline you'll get 75 resist

378
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
in order to be resistance capped. Um, in exchange, there were some unique items that were, uh, that had

379
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
just a whole bunch of, um, all resistance on them. Like Jens Blessing, some, some boots that just gave you

380
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
like 50 some percent, um, maximum resistance to all elements. Uh, those ones...

381
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Too much of it, a little by itself. Yeah, exactly. So some of those outliers that really solve your

382
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
resistance a little too easily, we're going to tone those down a little bit. Um, but kind of in

383
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
exchange, we give everyone, uh, the option to build a little bit more to make sure that,

384
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that building up resistance has a kind of a meaningful journey to it. Uh, and finally on this

385
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
slide that affects, um, all characters, the key passives, we've also done a pass much like with basic

386
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
skills to look at, um, our various key passives that affect every build, um, and, and kind of look at their

387
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
relative power level. And a lot of the outliers that we've seen in class balance, um, historically

388
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
have come from a key passive that just scales kind of infinitely, right? You, you build up some critical

389
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
strike damage, which increases your other damage and that just scales infinitely. And that causes

390
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
builds that can use that key passive to be far more powerful than builds that use other key passives,

391
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
which maybe don't scale that infinitely. Um, so with that in mind, we looked at every key passive

392
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and we've set a bar of about 75%, um, multiplicative damage, um, a bonus. So if it, if it just said do

393
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
increase damage, it would say 75% increase. Now some will have more conditions, you know,

394
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
it only affects certain types of damage. And so we budget those at a little bit higher and so on.

395
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Um, but we, anything that had like a previous uncapped scaler, we're going to put a cap on it to

396
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
make sure that it kind of hits that 75% mark and even a handful of some key passives that were

397
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
underperforming that mark that were, were not quite that good, uh, have gotten buff up to, to try

398
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
to let them compete. And so builds that, um, got some of those buffed key passives. We'll be really

399
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
happy to see that too. Absolutely. I guess I'll just make a comment. We're not the fun police, right?

400
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
We're not coming here to ruin your day, but what we are doing is we want to make a more consistent

401
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
experience for our players and we want the pieces to fit together naturally. Your progression is smooth.

402
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There's all these puzzle pieces. They just make sense as you stack them up. And we just,

403
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
we want to move away from having such extreme outliers. Yeah. The, the extreme balance outliers

404
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
are really what kind of, um, can kill the fun of the game. If you're like, Hey, I want to play,

405
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
you know, whatever kind of, uh, build you want, but then you see somebody else doing something

406
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
different and you're like, Oh, they are a hundred times better than me. It actually does affect how much

407
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
fun you're having because you feel like you're playing suboptimally. And, uh, by, by kind of bringing

408
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
some of these, uh, more in line to, to, uh, uh, kind of a budget of power that we want from certain

409
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
sources, we help to, to eliminate those outliers that are like miles ahead of everybody else.

410
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Um, with that in mind, you know, we, we think that this is, uh, going to promote better build

411
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
diversity, of course, as, as you can play more options and it won't feel as bad that you aren't,

412
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
um, uh, you aren't being left behind in such a way. All right. So let's, uh, move on to the

413
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
individual class changes. Those affect everybody, but of course, every class has some new stuff to

414
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,000
talk about here. On first up, uh, we've got barbarians. Uh, so for the barbarian, um, the big

415
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
talk of them for a while has been earthquakes in particular. Barbarians, uh, love to, uh, you know,

416
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
stomp on the ground and they stomp so hard that they make some earthquakes. Um, those have been extremely

417
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
powerful for a handful of seasons and we know that, you know, there's other fantasies to explore

418
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
in barbarian other than just earthquakes. And so we have done, um, some updates to kind of bring down

419
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
some of the power level of earthquakes specifically on its legendary paragon node, uh, the force of

420
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
nature that gave it a ton of multiplicative damage on the earthquakes that has been brought down quite

421
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
a bit. Um, to the second bullet point here, a lot of the legendary paragon nodes in, in barbarian

422
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
paragon and across every other class has been kind of simplified. Some of them used to have

423
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
effects which is like do a thing to get a buff to give you some damage and it stacks up to five

424
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
times, right? It would be like kind of a multi-step thing for a paragon node, which, uh, we thought

425
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
that's maybe a little bit more complex. It's asking you a little bit too much. Um, so we've simplified

426
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
them and often it's just like, hey, do a thing, get a bonus and that's it. Right. Uh, and specifically

427
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
on barbarian, uh, I think they got some of the bigger updates in that, in that regard. And in a lot of

428
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
cases the, the paragon become even more powerful because you don't need to stack it up five times

429
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
or whatever it might be. You just get the bonus right out of the gate. So they are slightly more

430
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
powerful. Could you say barbarians are getting a seismic shakeup? I'm so sorry. A little bit,

431
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
a little bit. On some of these, it may, may feel that way. Yes. Um, additionally, we've, uh, we've got a new

432
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
unique item this season. Uh, we know that, uh, players love playing with, uh, Bash Cleave, uh, from a while back. And now, uh, what if every other one of their

433
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
basic skills could cleave? Well, have I got the unique for you? And, uh, it's my favorite named unique in this

434
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
season, which is saying something. It's true. Um, it is the hooves of the mountain god. So good.

435
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So, uh, hooves of the mountain guard, god, whenever you, um, attack with a basic skill while you're at

436
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
maximum fury, you kind of enter the state where your fury is going to be draining and you're in, you're kind

437
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
of empowered here. And during that time, your basic skills will cleave and deal increased damage.

438
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
All of your basic skills will do that while you're empowered here. And of course, uh, your,

439
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
your fury is draining. So you're going to want to keep spamming those basic skills to rebuild it back

440
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
up and kind of maintain that state as long as possible. Yeah. So at this point with this unique,

441
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you really care about generating a tremendous amount of fury, but it's not actually to cast a

442
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
core. It's just to keep going. Yeah. Yeah. Keep going and keep hitting with your, your basic skills that

443
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
are just hitting hard and cleave in all around you. It's pretty awesome. Uh, we've got a video clip here

444
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
of this in action. Of course, we've seen, uh, Bash cleave before, uh, through some of the tempering, um, affixes.

445
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Uh, that temporary affix is going to be updated to give, uh, another multiplicative, uh, bonus to,

446
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
to bash here, but, um, because now it can cleave through this, this unique. And of course you can,

447
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
uh, mow through a whole, uh, uh, uh, set of skeletons here, uh, with your bash while your,

448
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
your fury is draining. Yeah. I love that. The parts coming up where, yep. One hit,

449
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
they're just all to the side. Oh yeah. Oh my goodness.

450
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
All right. We've got, uh, next class. We've got the druid to talk about. All right. So the, uh,

451
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
druid this season, uh, the, um, talk of the druid has been cataclysm for a while. Um, a couple

452
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
points on that. So, uh, a lot of cataclysm, it's this long lasting ultimate, right? You, you,

453
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
you press cataclysm, you get the storm around you. It lasts a while. And, um, it, it suffered from,

454
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
uh, some like we call snapshotting, um, where you get a buff or some effect that says, hey,

455
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
your next skill cast does increase damage or, or it has some effect. And when you, uh, when you press

456
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
cataclysm, it's obviously a very long effect and it benefits from that effect from the, the, the bonus

457
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
damage to your next cast. Uh, that's absolutely intended, right? When we say your next cast,

458
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
we mean the whole cast cataclysm is a great thing to do that on. Uh, that being said, we, we do find that

459
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
cataclysm being the only way to play druid, or at least the only kind of competitive way to play

460
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
druid is not really healthy because we know that is a kind of mechanically intensive play style that

461
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
you need to think about buffs. You need to set it up kind of precisely. And for players who like that,

462
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
uh, play style, we, we would love to encourage that. But when it becomes the only way or the

463
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
absolute best way, the kind of mandatory way to play a class, uh, that's kind of unhealthy. And so we've

464
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
done some, uh, numerical nerfs to bring cataclysm and some of the modifiers to it, uh, down to earth

465
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,000
a little bit. So it, it will, um, allow for other opportunities, uh, other ways to play druid in a

466
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:27,000
competitive way. Um, so some of those are grizzly rage. Um, we've got, uh, updates to, uh, a lot of

467
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
legendaries that used to talk to grizzly rage. And that does also remind me, um, about, uh, what we're

468
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
doing with legendaries this season, as we talk about this, um, in previous seasons, we've always

469
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,000
had a new unique item and a new legendary aspect for every class, uh, here for season nine, we're

470
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
just going to be doing a brand new unique item. And we're instead of doing reworks to a lot of

471
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
existing legendaries. Uh, so a handful of legendaries on each class have been, uh, rather

472
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
substantially reworked where we, we looked at them and said, Hey, we have a legendary that already talks

473
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
to grizzly rage, but it kind of sucked. Right. And we said, well, rather than make a brand new one,

474
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
let's take this existing one that really wasn't hitting that mark. And then just like functionally

475
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
change a lot of things to it. Um, it may still have, you know, the same kind of theme, same kind

476
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
of niche probably keeps the same name in a lot of cases. Um, but instead of like adding a brand new

477
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
legendary aspect to that kind of dilutes the drop pool, right? It, every, every legendary we add

478
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
makes it harder to find any in particular legendary. You also don't want a situation where

479
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
like if we leave that, uh, aspect not desirable, but then we make a new one that is you're like,

480
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh man, I really hope I find the good one and not the bad one. So that's another positive for this.

481
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Exactly. So we've done a lot of updates on every class, uh, to take their, their, uh, poor, the,

482
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
the bad legendaries and, and look to update them to support some of the new play styles that we're

483
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
interested in encouraging this season. And so for Druid, uh, several of the ones talking to grizzly rage

484
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
and poison in particular are going to be updated. So benevolent of us finding homes for all these

485
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
legendaries, you know, it's great. You know, like now they have a home to go to. They actually

486
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
hopefully find a new niche to fit into and they won't be so sad off to the side and people pick

487
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
them up and they're like, no in the gutter. Yeah. Yeah. That's absolutely the hope is, is that we're

488
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
able to, to look at every legendary and unique item in the game and say, Hey, there's you pick it up and

489
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
you read it and you're like, Oh, I see where this would be useful. And you would feel excited about it.

490
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It might not be the build you're currently playing, but you, you see that it does have a home and a

491
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
niche. That's our goal. And we know that a lot of legendaries in the game right now aren't hitting

492
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
that mark. And that's why we're, we're focusing on, on reworks, uh, at least for this season, right?

493
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Uh, with that in mind with, uh, grizzly rage and some poison updates, let's talk about, um,

494
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
probably one of my favorite visual uniques of the season. Uh, I call it splashing poison puddles,

495
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
right? Because, um, you know, we're getting, we're coming up on summer here. Everyone loves splashing in the sun,

496
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
you know, playing in the water, but we're in Diablo in the world of sanctuary and nothing's ever that wholesome.

497
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's, it's, it's poison bottles. Let's take a look at the rotting lightbringer.

498
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So the rotting lightbringer, um, every 10 seconds, when you cast pulverize, it'll form a poison puddle

499
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
where you pulverize. And if you pulverize that puddle again, then it'll splash, uh, additional

500
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
percent of that damage, uh, to, to enemies, uh, nearby. It'll like throw out some extra little, uh,

501
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
little projectiles of poison. Um, and of course you are, um, splashing in the, in the, in the poison

502
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
puddle to, to damage everyone around it. Sounds horrifying, Charles. Oh, it is.

503
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It sounds absolutely terrifying. Yeah, it's all your enemies. Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.

504
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
This is fun in the sun. This is, this is great fun in the sun. Uh, I think we had a video clip here

505
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
of this in action, right? Of course, we're at the beach. Where else would you be? You splash, make a

506
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
poison puddle, and as you do that, you know, little, uh, globs of poison go out and, uh, hit the enemies

507
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
around you. And this is also marrying the concept of like poison, the, the, the, the theme in Druida of poison,

508
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
mm-hmm, and werebear, which has typically been for specifically, uh, uh, werewolf, but now we're,

509
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
we're seeing it here too. Druids are, are the master of kind of this hybridization and mixing and matching,

510
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
uh, these things. So, so we always love encouraging, you know, you finding ways to mix, mix these up.

511
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Right. All right, uh, enough on Druid. Let's talk about the Necromancer. So Necromancer has, uh,

512
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
had some powerful ultimates as well. This is going to be a common theme. A lot of ultimate skills have been

513
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,000
quite powerful recently, uh, in particular Soul Rift and Blood Wave. Now Soul Rift is, uh, a skill

514
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
which does everything, right? It does damage, it gives you increased damage, it applies vulnerable,

515
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
it gives you resource, uh, gives you barrier, it, uh, restores your potion charges. Yeah. Oh my goodness.

516
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Why not? So, um, we looked at all these things and said, well, we could like just chop down the numbers

517
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
on some of these because like almost everyone is playing Soul Rift if you're not playing Blood Wave.

518
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
It's like one of those two as a Necromancer. Um, and we decided that the, the best course of action

519
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
for Soul Rift is to just kind of reduce some of its functionality. So it will still do all of those

520
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
things except generate a barrier. Uh, the barrier generation was giving a little bit too much

521
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
survivability, which we thought felt a bit more at home in like the Bone Storm or Blood Wave kind of world,

522
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
um, as like kind of a more survivability, uh, ultimate. Right. Uh, Soul Rift will still give

523
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
you lots of resource and still, um, increases your damage by just a little bit instead of, uh, a ton.

524
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Uh, but we think that'll bring it, uh, a bit more down to earth and give some other options, uh, like

525
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Army of the Dead and Bone Storm a bit of chances to compete. So overall you would say like it's kind

526
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
of moving towards being, its theme is kind of like it's an engine for you, right? It sustains your potions,

527
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
it gives you a sense, uh, and that's its big, you know, gameplay niche. Yeah,

528
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,000
rather than being kind of your, uh, defensive tanky, uh, source. Uh, Blood Wave as well has

529
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
been kind of the other ultimate skill that most Necromancers have been building around.

530
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Uh, this one just does a ton of damage and a lot of that has come from some of the unique items

531
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
that interact with it. Uh, they give, uh, kind of a disproportionate amount of damage output,

532
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,000
uh, an increase to your Blood Wave. Uh, specifically Endira's Memory, which works on your, um, your pants,

533
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
your leg armor. Uh, that's a slot which for most characters that don't have a unique item,

534
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
uh, is not really an offensive slot. You can't really get a whole lot of bonus damage from that.

535
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And so we're looking to, to say, hey, any unique items that are on, on pants in particular,

536
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
we're going to be looking to reduce the, the damage output of there. They'll still have some damage

537
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
output, but not quite as much. And so that's where, um, we're looking to reduce the power of Blood Wave

538
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
overall is on, on some of those uniques that talk to it. Uh, but of course we've got new things to

539
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
play with on the Necromancer. We've got Skeletal Archmages. And so this comes on the new unique,

540
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
the Hand of Nas. So the Hand of Nas, uh, new unique gloves, which, uh, if you really want to be playing

541
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
a minion build, but you're like, I just want mages, you know, maybe you're really vibing with the,

542
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
the Haradric Mage spellcraft theme of the season. Yes.

543
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Um, if you sacrifice both your Warriors and your Golem, and so you are all in on mages,

544
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
you get to summon additional mages for every minion that you've sacrificed.

545
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So if you used to have a whole bunch of, you know, bonus, um, Skeletal, uh, uh,

546
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Warriors, you now can get that many more mages. Uh, once mages attack, uh, 25 times,

547
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
they get to level up. They can rank up to a Skeletal Archmages. They get a little bit bigger,

548
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
they get a little bit of a flashy visual, and the Skeletal Archmages will, uh, deal some bonus

549
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
damage. And also whenever they are attacked, they will teleport away to safety because they are,

550
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
you know, they got a new skill. When you level up, you learn a new skill. Same thing with Skeletal

551
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Mages. It's just the way it works. Of course. So, um, let's take a look at this in action.

552
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So you've got, um, just four mages here. Of course you're going to be able to have more,

553
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
uh, if you really spec into it. And, uh, as enemies come up and attack those mages, uh,

554
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
occasionally they will teleport away. Their attacks now can do some, uh, additional burst damage.

555
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And they've got a little, uh, like lightning effect on their hands. And they're a little

556
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
bit bigger to show that they are, um, you know, promoted to Archmage status.

557
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So with this unique, I can't actually have my warriors or my golem.

558
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Right.

559
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So now I'm the tank for my mages.

560
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You do need to be tanking for your mages, right? It kind of turns the traditional minion play style

561
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
of like, my minions go forward and, and protect me. And it turns it on its head, right?

562
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
You have this powerful backline of a lot of mages who do bonus damage. Um, but in, in exchange,

563
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
you know, you need to protect them. They can protect themselves a little bit with the, uh,

564
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
the teleport away to safety. Uh, but it's going to kind of be on you, the necromancer to,

565
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
to be the frontline in this kind of build.

566
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's pretty awesome.

567
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
All right. Next up, we've got the rogue. So the rogue big talk has been, uh, their ultimate skills,

568
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
uh, death trap, as, uh, you know, ultimate skills are great. They, they have been, uh,

569
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
ultimate and very powerful for quite a while. Uh, rogues, no exception. They've got death trap

570
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
has been one of the most powerful builds for kind of two seasons in a row here.

571
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Uh, similar to soul rift in a lot of ways that kind of did a lot of everything.

572
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Um, we, and we also know that it did a ton, ton of damage on its own, right?

573
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Uh, so, and it also had a, uh, unique pants item, the eyes in the dark that really talked to it and

574
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
increased its damage output, uh, dramatically. Uh, so much in the line of our philosophy of,

575
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
hey, pants armor shouldn't be so ridiculous amount of damage output, even if it is unique.

576
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Uh, we've done some tuning on the eyes in the dark to make sure that death trap is not, uh,

577
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
uh, quite as, as explosively damaging as it, as it has been in the past.

578
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Uh, we are looking to buff up, uh, the infiltrators and bursting venoms.

579
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Um, legendary items that talk to poison trap and poison builds and saying,

580
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
hey, you know, there's other traps out there. You can play poison trap.

581
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Um, so giving a little bit more support here with those, um, legendary reworks.

582
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And we also have some updates to, um, uh, Eagle Horn.

583
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
This is the, the penetrating shot unique, uh, bow.

584
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Uh, just, just some numerical buffs there to make sure it's actually hitting harder

585
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and penetrating shot has a bit more of a, of a reason to use it.

586
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Uh, we know that, uh, kind of ranged rogues have fallen out of favor for a while.

587
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It's been a lot more about melee and I mean, death trap is even a melee kind of skill.

588
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yeah.

589
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Um, and we know that, uh, players love to play ranged rogue as well.

590
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So we want to make sure that we give a little bit more support to that to enable it.

591
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Um, for those who do like melee play styles, but maybe not trap, uh, you might like flurry.

592
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And if so, we have got a, uh, great unique, uh, coming next season.

593
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The death mask of Nirmatruk.

594
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I definitely pronounced that correct.

595
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Um, so you can now over exert yourself while casting flurry.

596
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Well, that's a weird thing to say.

597
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
What does that mean?

598
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It does mean that you spend your life total if you don't have enough energy.

599
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Mm.

600
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So energy, that's not a problem anymore.

601
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
You have your whole life total to work with.

602
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Yeah.

603
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Uh, so you can keep on casting flurry, but when it does cost you your life total,

604
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
when you're kind of overexerted in this state, it's going to stack up above.

605
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's going to increase the, the attack speed of flurry,

606
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
and it's going to increase its damage output for five seconds.

607
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So you really want to be in this kind of overexerted state.

608
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It doesn't actually do anything if you're not overexerting.

609
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah.

610
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
So you really want to make sure that you're getting to the state.

611
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I love how this kind of, um, changes up some of your,

612
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
like how you think about your build.

613
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You don't necessarily want a lot of resource regeneration.

614
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Right.

615
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You want more health regen.

616
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Uh, cause if you have too much resource,

617
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
then maybe you're not even getting into the state as often as you'd like.

618
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Let's take a look at this in action.

619
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I actually really love this clip of the, uh, the rogue just going super fast, right?

620
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So they sneak in and as they're stacking up, you can see they've got like no resource.

621
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
They go hyper fast.

622
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
This is, is such a, a fast attacking skill when it's all stacked up.

623
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh my goodness.

624
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But of course, the faster you attack, the faster your life total drains.

625
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yep.

626
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And you know, if you're really low, it's not going to kill you by doing this.

627
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
You just won't be able to cast it there, but it does mean you're on very low life

628
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
and any stray attack might take you out if you're not super careful with it.

629
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I will raise a flag for those of you curious about trying this out.

630
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It's called a death mask for a reason.

631
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Yeah.

632
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It might not necessarily be their death.

633
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It might be yours.

634
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
So be a little careful.

635
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But on the positive side,

636
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
you do get a look like an anime character zooming around like crazy.

637
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Like, look at that.

638
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Absolutely.

639
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Definitely.

640
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Uh, definitely, uh, hardcore players beware with this one.

641
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Yep.

642
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Um, you know, might be a little risky for you.

643
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,000
All right.

644
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Uh, we've got the Sorceress next.

645
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So the Sorceress has been, um, definitely one of our top builds this season, I would say,

646
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
in Lightning Spear.

647
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And, uh, I think one of the, the, the big talking points around Sorceress for a while has been

648
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Lightning Spear.

649
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Uh, a lot of players have felt like that is the only or best way to play Sorc.

650
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
For a number of seasons now.

651
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And it's not just been just one season here.

652
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And one of the reasons for that, I'd say the main reason is that Lightning Spear baseline is

653
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
pretty bad.

654
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Like if you just get the skill on its own with nothing else, it doesn't really do a whole lot

655
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
of damage.

656
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Uh, but then you get a Splintering Energy Legendary and suddenly it goes from one to a hundred real

657
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
quick.

658
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Oh, yes.

659
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
That, that Legendary aspect is, is like one of the most powerful in terms of like how much

660
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
percentage gain does it give the skill in question.

661
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Splintering Energy is like way far above, uh, really where we want Legendary aspects to be.

662
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And that kind of speaks to this, this outlier concept we've been talking about where when

663
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
you have one particular source of power that is disproportionately valuable, like a key passive

664
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
that scales crazy or a Splintering Energy Legendary that that's the only thing that matters,

665
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,000
right?

666
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah.

667
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Is, is that maximizing the damage of this one thing is the only thing that matters.

668
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
We find that that leads to some of these outlier situations and it's also just not as fun.

669
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Right.

670
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Like nothing else in your build mattered.

671
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It's just about that one, uh, effect, whether it be a Legendary or a key passive.

672
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And you find that there's better build variety and healthier class balance when that power is

673
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
spread out among as many different sources that you might want as possible rather than concentrated

674
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
so intensely in one.

675
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Right.

676
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And so this was definitely one of the most egregious examples, I'd say, of, of, uh, concentrating the power in a

677
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
single spot in that Splintering Energy, uh, aspect.

678
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So, uh, with that in mind, we've taken, uh, the baseline Lightning Spear and buffed up its damage

679
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
rather substantially.

680
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Uh, but of course the Splintering Energy has, uh, dramatically been reduced in effectiveness.

681
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So overall we still think the Lightning Spear builds are going to be, uh, brought down quite a

682
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
bit because they were quite far above everyone else.

683
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Uh, they also definitely relied on some of the overpower changes, uh, or they relied on overpower to

684
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
really, uh, get into the highest levels of pit pushing.

685
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And so that's, um, overpower is obviously a little bit weaker in this season.

686
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So we think that'll bring it down a bit.

687
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Um, in an exchange, we're looking at, at buffing up some of the other builds available to, to Sork.

688
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Uh, specifically with Burning, uh, as we, one of the, the Burning, uh, key passive,

689
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
the Combustion key passive was one of those that was kind of uncapped scaling.

690
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It wasn't necessarily problematic, but maybe that was really just because Lightning Spear crowded

691
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
it all out. Um, same with like Enlightenment, kind of crowding up those options.

692
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Uh, we have put a cap on that, like we, we've said with the philosophy of, of making sure that

693
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
no individual power source eclipses all others. Uh, but with that in mind, we did look and say,

694
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
well, hey, this might be a little bit of a nerf to some other Burning builds like Firewall

695
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
or Incinerate. And so we've just done like a 25-ish percent, uh, baseline buff to those, uh,

696
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Burning skills just to make sure they can, uh, kind of, uh, be compensated for that.

697
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Uh, similar with Enlightenment, that was another one of the key passives that kind of blew past our

698
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
power budget. So we've done a bit of rebalancing there. Um, but also we've got, um, a new unique,

699
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
uh, one of my favorites, uh, huge Hydras.

700
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Yes. So this is the...

701
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Chad has been very excited for this.

702
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Oh, really?

703
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
They saw huge Hydras on the front.

704
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Huge Hydras.

705
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I'm just like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

706
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
What's this? What's this?

707
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Yes. So we've got the Ophidian Iris. This is a, an ancestral unique amulet. Uh, and here,

708
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
uh, Hydra gets the core skill tag. So, um, it'll benefit from a lot of your core skill bonuses.

709
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And it'll always summon a three-headed Hydra on, rather than, um, even if you had more heads,

710
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
if you had like plus Hydra heads, uh, you're still only going to get three. That's the kind

711
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
of the baseline number. But for each head that you would have had above three, the Hydra goes larger

712
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,000
and deals, uh, like 100% more damage per additional head. And so these big heads will also, uh,

713
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
do splash damage rather than just a single target and, and hitting one enemy. They kind of explode

714
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
on impact just like they're shooting fireballs. Yes.

715
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Um, and so this is going to turn, um, you know, your Hydra from like a lot of spammy little tiny

716
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
hits into individual bigger hits with big Hydra heads. So it's no longer about how many heads can

717
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,000
get on my Hydra. It's about how big can I make my baby Hydra. Yes. Excellent. Um, so it'll, it'll scale

718
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
up with its damage for every additional head that you got. And of course this has, uh, an inherent

719
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
affects that casted Hydras do have plus two heads, which, um, so you already have a bit of built-in

720
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
multiplier on the, on the emulate itself. Uh, so we've got a side-by-side comparison here, right? So on the

721
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
left here, we've got the kind of baseline. You've got four Hydra heads. They're, you know, they're, they're

722
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
fine. They're there. But after, if you really build up lots of bonus Hydra heads, you're only going to get

723
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
three, but they're going to, they're going to be much bigger than, than you, the character and,

724
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
uh, you know, can, can be as big as some of those big elites running around the screen. And of course

725
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:31,000
with, uh, splashing and exploding, uh, fire attacks, uh, it should be, um, a lot more appealing. Um,

726
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
we've also taken a look at, at updating some, some other things on Hydra. We removed its baseline

727
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
mana cost, um, increased its lucky hit chance, and also done some other modifications to Conjuration

728
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
and Hydra legendaries, uh, just to make sure that like kind of a Hydra build really makes a lot of

729
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:52,000
sense and, and is able to be competitive. So really love to hear feedback on, in the, the PTR about,

730
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
um, how these kind of, uh, builds land. And last but not least, uh, we've got the Spiritborn.

731
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So the Spiritborn, uh, has been probably one of the classes that's been furthest behind,

732
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I'd say, in terms of, uh, on the current live season. And so we're definitely looking at,

733
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
um, I think they're going to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the basic skill rebalancing work

734
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
that we did where we looked at every basic skill and, and doubled or tripled the baseline values of

735
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
a lot of them. Um, but in exchange, some of the scalers on legendaries and uniques, um, we, we adjust

736
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
those downward a little bit. Um, the net result is still that basic skill builds will be better than

737
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
before. And I think Spiritborn is going to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that. Additionally,

738
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
we've also got an update to the deflection aspect with, uh, Razor Wings build. Uh, previously,

739
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
this was one of those legendaries that didn't really have a home. It dealt like a percentage

740
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
of counterattacks damage and counterattack does not do damage. So a percent of zero is zero.

741
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Yeah. Um, so now it's going to increase the Razor Wings itself damage when you reflect them with this

742
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
deflection kind of gameplay. And so, uh, just a little bit more kind of multiplicative damage support

743
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:05,000
for Razor Wings build. Um, following with the theme of ultimate skills, uh, on all classes, as well

744
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,000
being kind of a little, um, too strong, the hunter ultimate, the jaguar ultimate, has been the, the

745
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
ultimate on Spiritborn, uh, since its launch that really every Spiritborn player has used. I think like

746
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,000
something like 90 plus percent of Spiritborn players are using the hunter, uh, currently. And, uh,

747
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
that's great that you're having a lot of fun with it, but it's also means that there's other options

748
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
that aren't really being explored. It's kind of taking up all the space in the, the, the build

749
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:37,000
variety. And so one of the reasons for that is that, uh, the hunter, uh, allows, it resets itself.

750
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
If you cast it and then kill an enemy, it's going to reset itself and it can kind of chain reset. Um,

751
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
and, uh, the chance of chain resetting reduces every time it does. And so it just kind of like

752
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
feels bad whenever you're like, oh, I guess I ran out of luck and now I have to wait. Yeah. Um,

753
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
we found that to be like one ex kind of degenerately powerful for anything that triggers on when you

754
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:06,000
cast an ultimate. Uh, but also it was just not fun when you kind of failed to, to, to get that reset.

755
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yeah. And so we're looking at reworking the exact mechanics of the way the hunter reset works. So

756
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
it'll still have that like kind of cooldown reduction theme, uh, but it won't be quite as feast or famine as

757
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:22,000
it was in the past. Uh, we've also got a new unique item. Uh, this one is the, uh, Balaton's, uh, Maxiltal.

758
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I might've mispronounced that. Uh, Maxiltal. I literally looked up how to pronounce this this morning and

759
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I, I, I tried. It's a tricky one, Charles. It's a very tricky one. Uh, so this, uh, works with, uh, poison and

760
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
thorns built kind of hybridizing those two together. So, uh, attacks against close enemies. When you're,

761
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
when you're attacking close up, uh, you're, you're up close and personal, you're going to do bonus a percent of

762
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,000
your thorns damage, but as poisoning over three seconds. So you get a kind of a free way to apply poisoning here.

763
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
But if you've also been hit recently and you've retaliated with your thorns, then that poisoning

764
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
damage is going to be increased even further. So it really allows you to convert your thorns damage

765
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
into offense. Um, and it does even reward you for, for actually getting hit with that thorns. Uh,

766
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
but a lot of this is going to come in that poisoning damage when you're, when you're hitting the enemies

767
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
up close and personal. Yeah. I love how this unique really takes the core concept of thorns,

768
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
which is you must be hit, but still it like empowers you very intensely in terms of your

769
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
offense by leaning into that, which is pretty cool. Yeah. It definitely solves that problem where

770
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,000
previous thorns builds were kind of, we were hesitant to make pure thorns of like just build

771
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
thorns and nothing else to be too powerful because then you just walk in and you AFK and everything

772
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
dies and that's not necessarily fun gameplay. And so I think this does a really good job of, of, um,

773
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
straddling the line of active and passive gameplay that, that thorns players, uh, would really want.

774
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Totally.

775
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Totally. So that's a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of class changes coming in the PTR. And so

776
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
we'd love to hear all the feedback you have around, you know, do these unique items and the legendary

777
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
reworks and the other balance changes, are these builds good, right? Can you play that, that Hydra

778
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Sork, um, is it, you know, is it reasonable to play in Torment 4, uh, at the highest levels when you

779
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
have like the really maxed out stuff and every point along the progression, um, and not just that build,

780
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
every build that we're, that I talked about here. Uh, we're also really looking to make sure that we

781
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
get feedback on the basic skill, uh, update. Like I said, we touched every single basic skill in the

782
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
game. There might be some outliers still, some things that are a little too strong, a little too weak.

783
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Um, and as we're going to be doing similar passes and looking at other, ask other kind of categories

784
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
of skills on the skill tree, we'd love any kind of feedback on, um, kind of exactly where they land so

785
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
that we can help and inform future balancing as well. Uh, and finally, uh, just wanted to, uh,

786
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
make sure that, uh, we really are focusing on, on kind of shifting up that very top of the meta.

787
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I talked a lot about some nerfs to the, the really over-performing builds, uh, specifically

788
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
overpower, uh, because we do want to make sure that season nine, you don't feel like, oh, it's all

789
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
the same builds all again at the top of the meta, uh, for the third season in a row. We, we really don't

790
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
want that to be the case. We want to make sure there's new options for, for players, uh, who really want

791
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
to push the limit of their character and it's not just the same thing over and over again.

792
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Totally. Wow. Well, Charles, take a bow. That was, uh, incredible section. I mean,

793
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
players are going to have a ton to chew on in the PTR. That is, uh, an absolute smattering of content.

794
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Are you surprised he pronounced everything correctly? I mean, you nailed it.

795
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Yeah, I was ready to razz me on the spear for an unique, and I'm like, oh, man's, man's been practicing.

796
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,000
That's fantastic. Uh, so yeah, patch notes and the blog do hit following the stream. So if you missed

797
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
anything in any of the sections, we will have those available following the streams. You can get in

798
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
and really get into the nitty gritties of all those changes. Um, but we do have some more changes

799
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
still coming that are going to affect, uh, the entire game. So Aislinn, I know we've got some

800
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
systems. We kind of teased it. Dan sort of touched it at the start of the stream, but, uh, we can finally

801
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
get into it. What do you have for us? Yeah. Let's talk about systems, guys. So the first one I want to

802
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
talk about is the night, uh, or excuse me, the seasonal activity variety. That's the next one.

803
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Um, so something we saw in season eight was we added, um, seasonal currency to the layer bosses,

804
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
and it was for the season of the boss, uh, which we really ended up liking. Uh, the reason we like it

805
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:18,000
a ton is because it touches all parts of the game. Like you need to go to a bunch of different places to

806
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
actually get layer keys. And so if layer bosses in the end game are a thing that provide access,

807
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
access to seasonal progression, that kind of naturally disseminates out to the entire game

808
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
experience, which we really, really liked. So we actually want to keep that going forward. Uh,

809
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:40,000
and we'd like to use that, uh, on top of any other ways that the player can earn, uh, seasonal reputation

810
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
or seasonal currency in a given season. Um, and, uh, the same is true, uh, not just in Torment, but across

811
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,000
the entire game through elites and bosses granting seasonal reputation. Whenever you kill any elites or any boss

812
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
in the game in season nine, uh, you are going to earn seasonal reputation. And this is tying directly

813
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
into that problem we were having where, you know, we felt really pressured to go to Apparition Incursion.

814
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Um, we, we love the seasonal content and, uh, we love the Horadric strong rooms and we love all the new

815
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
amazing nightmare dungeon updates, but we want to also want to make sure that if you end up finding yourself

816
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,000
in Helltide or in a stronghold, because you felt like it, you're actually earning progress and the game's rewarding you for

817
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
playing it basically. This makes me so happy because I'm a very scatterbrained player. I'm always, you know,

818
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm going to do this activity, then this one, then this one, but now I get to feel good all the time.

819
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Yeah, that's, that's the hope. So thank you for that. That's awesome.

820
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Of course. Um, yeah, so that's the, that's the hope with this update. And I just want to reiterate,

821
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,000
um, there are still going to be really powerful and good ways to earn seasonal reputation and currency

822
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,000
specifically through interacting with the season. These are on top of all of that other stuff so

823
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
that you can just go do a bunch of cool stuff. So yeah, that's that. And let's talk about,

824
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,000
let's talk more about, uh, the, uh, the nightmare sigils, uh, and what's coming with that. So we talked

825
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
a little bit about it when Dan was talking about this and I actually want to preface this section with

826
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
something that's not listed here, but I think you guys might want to know. Uh, you can now teleport to

827
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
nightmare dungeons from inside a nightmare dungeon. Uh, we wanted to make that update.

828
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's just a quality of life change because this was season of the nightmare dungeon. So there you go.

829
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
It's going to be a lot smoother to go from nightmare dungeon to nightmare dungeon, uh, in season nine and

830
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
going forward in Diablo four, very happy about that. Cause it was kind of annoying to like have to

831
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
leave the dungeon and then go to the next one, but that's no longer a thing. Uh, okay. That out of the way,

832
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
let's talk about these new affixes and what's so cool about them. So, uh, in live right now,

833
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
there were only, uh, two positive affixes in the game. There was like an experience affix and a gold

834
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
affix and that ended up getting pared down over time. And we kind of wanted to take a step back

835
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and be like, how can we inject a lot more depth and ways for you to like find what you're actually

836
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
looking for in a nightmare dungeon. And so what we decided and landed on was we wanted to make a lot

837
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
more positive affixes and we wanted to assign a rarity system to them so that sometimes when you

838
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
crafted or found a nightmare dungeon sigil, you'd get really rare ones that were really powerful.

839
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And other times you'd get, uh, you know, normal ones, but, uh, ones that might give you like a specific

840
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
kind of reward, which can be really useful. Um, and so here, for example, we have the horagric materials

841
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
reserve. Uh, this one gives you a smattering of, uh, different resources that you might need. So if you

842
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
find yourself low on forgotten souls or other kinds of resources, you can specifically go to

843
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
this nightmare dungeon and stock up on that stuff. And we have some other affixes like that,

844
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
for example, specifically gems or different kinds of gems, which also helps you stock up on,

845
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
uh, whichever kinds of gems you might be needing. Um, and then there are, of course,

846
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
still like the experience one and the gold one and a lot of other, uh, miscellaneous affixes,

847
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
uh, that will just, you know, hopefully be really fun to just go in and poke around and pick one,

848
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
which ones are the best for you. Um, and another thing I really wanted to call out is that we've

849
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:13,000
specifically wanted to avoid penalizing specific elements or builds in negative nightmare dungeon

850
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:20,000
affixes. So something we saw, uh, earlier in Diablo's development or excuse me, Diablo 4 being live,

851
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:27,000
um, was there were negative affixes that would say, uh, you know, you deal less, uh, shadow damage or

852
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:34,000
whatever. And if your build was a shadow build, that kind of didn't feel great. Um, and so we wanted

853
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,000
to make sure that all of these negative affixes were more agnostic of speaking directly to your build,

854
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
but still provided the challenge. Um, and so with, with these two changes together, we're really hoping

855
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:52,000
that we're going to see a lot more variety and depth in actually, uh, engaging with nightmare dungeons,

856
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,000
and that they're not going to feel too frictioned or you're not going to find a nightmare dungeon that

857
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
just doesn't, that feels like it's telling you, no, you're not allowed to play me. Like we don't

858
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:10,000
want that happening. Um, and again, this is a permanent update to the game. We've done this because it is,

859
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
uh, you know, a season very heavily focused on nightmare dungeons, but which was like the perfect

860
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
time to do this. And now we're super stoked that it's going to be going forward. Um, and we want to hear

861
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
what you have to say about it. You know that, like I said, there's a lot of different affixes. Uh, let

862
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
us know how they feel, run through these dungeons, let us know how interacting with the mechanics in

863
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
them works, and if you like it or not. Uh, and we'll be able to take that feedback and make the system

864
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
even better for season nine's launch. Yeah, that was actually a question that Addiction had, uh, in

865
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Twitch chat, which is, are these dungeon changes permanent? And so for this section, all these changes

866
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
that Azen speak to are permanent and the same thing with Escalating Nightmares and Horagic Strongrooms,

867
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
those are going to persist, uh, beyond the 2-3-0 PTR in season nine. So, uh, and then everything

868
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Azen's getting to now, that's all going to affect, uh, the, the Eternal and Seasonal and will be

869
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,000
permanent. So, yeah, super nice, super good changes. Yes, super excited about it. All right, cool. Yeah,

870
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I think we have an asset here, uh, kind of showing off what you might be able to find in a nightmare

871
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:12,000
dungeon. So that nifty little purpley mirror thingy is a Horagic artifact, which is, uh, a part of one of

872
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
the new affixes that you'll actually find when, uh, venturing into nightmare dungeons. And of course,

873
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
our rogue is getting rid of this pesky blood blister. Uh, so, yeah, can't wait for you to try it all out.

874
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It's going to be fun. Next up, we have, uh, oh, drum roll, please. Thank you. I'm so excited. I'm very,

875
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:38,000
very happy and excited and proud to be able to say we are increasing the quality of items per torment

876
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,000
tier. And what this means is when you go into torment two or then further into three or four,

877
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:52,000
you are going to find more ancestral items. You are going to find more ancestral items from all sources.

878
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
This includes layer boss drops. When you go and fight a layer boss in a higher torment tier,

879
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
you are going to have a better chance at finding, uh, ancestrals when you climb those torments.

880
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,000
This is true throughout the world when things are just dropping randomly. This is true in the pit.

881
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:15,000
This is, this is true everywhere. Um, we really like this change. Uh, we think that it rewards you for,

882
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
uh, ascending the torment tier in a very impactful, you know, like we say, punch you in the face kind of

883
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:30,000
way. Um, and it's not so intense that it feels required though to go to higher torments. And that's

884
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
something we, uh, also really want to make sure we get right because we want to ensure that we're

885
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
enriching the progression journey for all players, regardless of where you are in the game right now.

886
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Um, and so again, you know, we keep saying this, but this is a, uh, going to be a test realm. So please go on,

887
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
try this out, see if you can feel the difference and, you know, can you feel the difference? Can you not feel

888
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,000
the difference? Do you like the difference between these different torment tiers, uh, and the, the loot quality changes that are occurring between them?

889
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Uh, and that's just another topic that we'd love to hear your feedback on.

890
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:11,000
All right. And with that said, let's just talk about a bit of more miscellaneous reward economy stuff.

891
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Uh, so here there's some, uh, more miscellaneous feedback that we got from season eight that we

892
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,000
want to just improve on for the game so that everyone just has more fun. Um, we hear you guys about

893
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
legendary rune drop rates. We know that those were too low. Uh, so we've just increased the chance

894
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
across the whole game, uh, to get that back to a point where it feels like if you are playing a lot

895
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
and you really are trying to make progress towards like crafting a mythic, that's feasible. Um, another

896
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
thing where, again, the big reward moments, uh, we want to make sure that when you actually run a

897
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,000
tribute of harmony, harmony, it feels like a big burst. Like it's like, oh yes, okay, cool. This is a lot of runes.

898
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:58,000
This is fantastic. Um, and so now if you really do want to find a lot of those runes, tributes of

899
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
harmony are going to be a really good bet. We also kind of just want to inject identity into under city

900
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:10,000
tributes in general that they now all just drop a rune always. So now just in general going to the

901
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,000
under city, you're going to find more runes than you certainly would have before. Um, and that just

902
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,000
applies to all different kinds of tributes. Um, the whisper cache resource increase one is actually

903
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
split among three different whisper caches. So we were finding that the gold whisper cache,

904
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
the materials whisper cache, and the, uh, gem fragment whisper cache just weren't really giving

905
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:38,000
you enough, uh, for the opportunity cost against the other kinds. So we just bumped up how much those

906
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
are giving you of their respective thing pretty substantially. You can also now actually find

907
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:50,000
whole gems inside gem fragment, uh, uh, whisper caches. Uh, and it's only a chance for some of the, uh,

908
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
good ones. Like for example, I think there's actually a very small chance to find a grand

909
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
gem now in a, uh, gem cache, which is a lot of gem fragments. So it's not a very high chance.

910
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
You gotta stop making my day. That sounds so cool. Oh my gosh.

911
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Yeah, let's go. Um, and oh yes, this is one of my personal favorites. So we saw that the, uh, jewelers of

912
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:18,000
sanctuary had adopted some wanderer unfriendly practices and their caches were perhaps a bit too expensive.

913
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Uh, and we have decided to, you know, crack down on that and, uh, make sure that they are,

914
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
they are being more friendly to our wanderers. Uh, so now here we have, uh, these different

915
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,000
jewelry cache types, their cost has been significantly reduced. Uh, and on top of that,

916
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
not only has their cost been significantly reduced, but they're going to give you, uh, quite a bit more,

917
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:45,000
uh, actual jewelry. So with the gem fragments increases, uh, or rather like different sources of,

918
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
uh, getting more gem fragments and the reduced cost and the increased stuff from the caches,

919
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
they should be more lucrative. Uh, and finally talking about gems, we have, uh, increased the

920
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
amount of gems you're going to be getting from infernal hordes as well. You know, again, punch you

921
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
in the face at this point. I'm sorry if I've given you a bloody nose, but you know, that's lots of face

922
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
punching today. There's a through line in the stream. Yeah. Poison puddles are rated M for excitement.

923
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:17,000
There you go. Um, yeah, but, uh, thank you guys for listening to the systems updates. Uh, there's a

924
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:23,000
lot to unpack here and these kinds of updates are sometimes a little challenging to test within a PTR

925
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,000
environment because you're getting like all these boosts, uh, and it only lasts a short period of time.

926
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,000
But if this kind of stuff interests you, please, by all means, test it out, let us know what you think,

927
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
give us all the feedback, uh, on it you want because everything is just super valuable for us

928
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:46,000
to tweak it to make it even more awesome. Yeah. Like as Dan said, uh, or sorry, Dan, as I'm citing Dan,

929
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
uh, one of the things he said is like, now's the time that we can turn the knobs and really juice

930
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
things up. So definitely go in and like, take your time with a lot of these changes. Some of them might

931
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
not feel, you know, impactful at first, but like really get a feel for how things have shifted because

932
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
there are so many different components in this PTR that it's gonna, you know, there's a ton of different,

933
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
uh, influences from all the different areas of the game. So that's really exciting, Aislinn. I'm

934
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
super excited to check those things out, get some more jeweler caches. Yeah, that'll be great. Yeah.

935
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Um, but yeah, so the 2-3-0 PTR, so some just general reminders for everyone watching.

936
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It's gonna be exclusively on PC Battle.net and it'll be available from May 27th until June 3rd.

937
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:28,000
So get in, test it out, please give us your feedback. Uh, the PTR forums, uh, the Diablo 4 PTR forums will be open.

938
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Those will be the, that'll be the best place for you to drop your feedback. Of course, we will be monitoring

939
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
our socials as usual, um, but we will be definitely looking into the, to the forums to get most of the

940
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,000
feedback there. Uh, the PTR boost will be available right outside of Kyovishad. Uh, Merak, our favorite

941
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
dancing demons there. Merak, he's kind of been getting fit for the summer. His, his offerings are

942
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,000
so diversified this time around. Like you can really segment out between seasonal currency, into the

943
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
different like item caches. Like there's a ton, a lot of great custom, uh, boosts that you can get from

944
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Merak. So he is there, he's in Kyovishad. He's happy to see you as always. And, uh, yeah, give us

945
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
your feedback on the PTR forums. Uh, we're really looking forward to it, uh, but definitely get in

946
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:12,000
there and test and give us all your feedback. And with that, that brings us to our Q and A portion

947
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
of the stream. So hopefully you've been dropping your questions in Twitch chat. We're really excited

948
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,000
to get into it. But first off, we do want to take a moment, uh, to address our first question,

949
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,000
which is what are we potentially doing about Reliquary? So this is our first stream since season eight

950
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Reliquary. It was our team's first big swing at changing the battle passes in a big way,

951
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
you know, bringing in different rewards, more enhanced rewards, giving some more choice to

952
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
the players. We have heard your overwhelming feedback. We know that this is a, is a system

953
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
with some mixed feelings. And so we are looking, the team is working very hard in the background.

954
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
We are looking to bring some more things into the Reliquary, um, to really give you some of that value.

955
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And, you know, that's something we've been talking about a lot. Thank you all for the feedback on it.

956
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Uh, we've been reading that, you know, across forums, the socials ever since the season launched.

957
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Um, and do note, we do have an event Reliquary that is coming up around the corner. So in a couple

958
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,000
weeks, oh, and pretty soon, you'll get another event Reliquary to dig your teeth into. But it is

959
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
something that the team has noted. Uh, we don't have a timeline on it, but it is something that we will,

960
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:17,000
uh, implement in the future. So thank you again for that. Uh, additionally with season eight, we also had

961
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,000
the Berserk collaboration, which like Aislinn, I know you've got the, the brand of sacrifice on right now.

962
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Like you're a huge Berserk fan. I became a fan once we started the IP collab. It's been really fun

963
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
seeing all the like guts and Griffiths running around in game. Uh, but again, we have heard

964
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
your feedback on, uh, on that IP collaboration. Um, and we've taken that into account. And for those

965
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
of you that know the roadmap, we do have another IP collab, uh, coming down the pipe in the future. So

966
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
we want to take that feedback from the Berserk collab and really integrate that into the future

967
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
offerings so that we can, you know, better diversify and change up some of the ways that you access

968
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:57,000
those, um, those, um, pieces of content from the IP collab. So again, thank you very much for your

969
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
feedback. We do really appreciate it. You know, ongoing game dev is an iterative process and the

970
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
community is a very big part of that. So we very much appreciate it. Yeah. Thank you for that. Um,

971
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,000
and yeah, with that, let's get into Q and A. Okay. So thank you. Shout out to the community team for

972
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:20,000
grabbing all these questions. What are we going to start off with? All right. Renata Cain, this one

973
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:27,000
may be, I might send this one to Dan first. Uh, will you be able to find Horadric strongholds inside

974
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Escalating Nightmares? Yeah, uh, you absolutely will. Uh, Escalating Nightmares are nightmare dungeons. Uh,

975
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:43,000
and so any feature that you could find in a nightmare dungeon, including the affixes we talked about,

976
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:50,000
uh, and also including Horadric strongrooms will, will appear in that flow. Awesome. Love that.

977
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Uh, the rudder, these new dungeon changes will be available, uh, in the eternal realm at the start

978
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:05,000
of next season? Uh, yes. The, uh, nightmare dungeon affix changes. Um, I think I, I might need to throw

979
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
it to Dan. I know they're permanent additions to the game. So yeah, they should be available in internal.

980
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
They should all be available in internal. Fantastic. Yeah. Fantastic. Uh, one other question. I didn't

981
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
have this, uh, it didn't catch the name as it was flying past, but people were asking, where is mouse and

982
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,000
keyboard on console? That is still coming with season nine. However, because the 2.3L PTR is exclusive to

983
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:32,000
PC, we're not going to test console changes. However, that is still coming. So fear, fear not. Uh, wow.

984
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Okay. I have to read this question just cause of the username. BigDaddyDen76. Uh, this one's for you,

985
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Charles. Okay. With Soul Rift not generating barrier, how is Necromancer going to gain defense?

986
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Uh, there's lots of different options for Necromancer to gain defense. Um, you've got,

987
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,000
um, some, some new options in the, uh, you know, the seasonal Horadric, um, uh, spellcraft. Uh, you've got

988
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Fortify through some of the blood magic. Um, you've got other ways of generating barrier, but not just

989
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
on Soul Rift. They've got, um, some passive and some other ways of generating barrier from legendaries.

990
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And you may just need to, you know, access some of the, the, uh, defensive legendary options that are

991
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:15,000
out there, which, uh, typically been very underutilized just because you had other ways of, of solving that

992
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
defense. Uh, we still think Soul Rift will be pretty appealing because it has, um, you know, like a lot of

993
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
energy, uh, resource gain. Um, but if you really want pure defense, then maybe look at some of the blood

994
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
skills, maybe look at bone storm instead, which still has a large damage reduction component

995
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:36,000
attached to it as well. Right. Fantastic. Uh, Mippy, are there any updates on tempering and masterworking?

996
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Hmm. Yeah. So tempering and masterworking is something that we have been talking about internally.

997
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Uh, you know, we don't have anything to share exactly yet about how we would want to tweak the system.

998
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Um, so hang tight, but I can say in terms of a quality of life update, uh, in 2-2-2,

999
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,000
so the patch coming out in season 8, uh, we are actually going to be updating the amount of non-gold,

1000
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:09,000
non-obdiscite resource and materials that it costs to masterwork, uh, from rank 1 to 4 and on the reset.

1001
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
And the reason why is because we were seeing that people that were getting pretty far into the end game

1002
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:20,000
would end up, like, effectively, um, deprecating the need for the gold and even potentially the

1003
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:26,000
obdiscite and then getting blocked by those other resources. But that was never actually the intent

1004
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:32,000
of the system. It was there. Those resource costs were there to like, uh, slow you down basically,

1005
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:38,000
or just rather friction you in other ways, um, and, and tax those resources never to be like the

1006
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,000
primary thing that blocks you. And so we don't want that to happen. So we've pulled back pretty

1007
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:49,000
significantly on how much that actually costs. Yeah. Uh, but beyond that, stay tuned as we keep

1008
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
filtering through feedback and please, please keep giving us feedback. Uh, that's really great.

1009
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,000
And like, I know we've all been masterwork blocked at a specific point, so anything to reduce friction

1010
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:04,000
in that system is, uh, is pretty great. Uh, Liam, this one's for you. Scroll of Wisdom. With a system like

1011
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Horadric Spells being this awesome, are you looking to maybe make it a permanent part of the game? I already

1012
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,000
feel sad knowing it's going to leave the game for the next season's power. So I can't specifically speak

1013
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
on that, but what I will say is nothing is ever truly gone because we are developers. We have access

1014
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:25,000
to everything, right? So as we, and this is a game that will continue to evolve and evolve. So the team

1015
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:30,000
hasn't talked about it. I can't say anything definitive, but you know, we love all the seasonal stuff we

1016
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
create and yeah, who knows for the future. Yeah. That's something we've seen in previous seasons where like,

1017
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
uh, back way back in season two, when we first did the vampiric powers, we

1018
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
brought some of them back as, um, some of the more popular ones back as unique items.

1019
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Um, once again, we're not committing to any particular bringing back, but, uh, it's always

1020
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
on our radar and that's why we love hearing feedback about the things that really resonate

1021
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:57,000
with players and then that can help us to design future systems, whether it be future seasonal or

1022
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,000
future, um, kind of those permanent systems as well. Uh, we're always listening to that and, and it's

1023
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
always on the table to bring them back, the ones that really resonate with players. Nice.

1024
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Uh, party cannon, 1990, very fun name. Uh, will there be, will there in the future be a possibility

1025
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,000
that the nightmare sigils can have active whispers shown on them?

1026
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Mm. Yeah. That's another thing that we've seen a lot of folks talk about.

1027
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Uh, it's, it's something we would, we're interested in exploring that space, uh, because it's a really

1028
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
fun and kind of a natural connection. Uh, right now for season nine, that's not something that's going to be,

1029
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:39,000
uh, directly in the season, but we do look to, you know, make these kinds of changes going forward

1030
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
pretty consistently. So, and if that's something you feel strongly about, please keep letting us

1031
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,000
know and, and we will, uh, we'll see what we can do. Absolutely. Uh, this one, Charles, I feel like

1032
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I already know what you're going to say to this. Uh, cop Mando, will there, will there be any more

1033
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
balance changes for the current season? Uh, for season eight, uh, the current season that is live.

1034
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Oh, actually. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, currently the, no, there's no plans for any more balance changes on

1035
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:10,000
season eight. Um, the, the season of bosses that's currently live on the game. Uh, we've updated our

1036
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,000
seasonal, uh, balance cadence a little bit. Um, so now starting in season eight and going forward, even

1037
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
into season nine, we're going to have, you know, the PTR before the season. That's when we do kind of

1038
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
our initial batch, like, Hey, these are the balance changes we're looking at. We take in a lot of the

1039
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:29,000
feedback from the PTR and then we iterate on it. And we, we, when it goes live, the season goes live,

1040
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,000
we, we say, Hey, here's the live season. Uh, we'll take the immediate feedback from that. If there's

1041
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,000
any kind of progression, uh, breakers, things that are really outlier things that we kind of missed or,

1042
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
you know, an interaction that, oops, that wasn't intended. And we'll try to make a rapid reaction

1043
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
within the first week or two of a season to, to bring it, um, you know, bring it down to earth or, or

1044
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
to, to bring some of those builds that were really underperforming our mark and bring those up a

1045
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:58,000
little bit. Uh, but after that point, we're, our intention is to really let the season ride, right?

1046
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Once, once you're about two weeks into the season, you've, you've already committed some time into

1047
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
your build. You've invested in your character and we really want to respect that time investment.

1048
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And we don't want to come in and say, Oh, just kidding. We're going to dramatically change the meta

1049
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,000
on you right after you've already done all that investment. We just know that's going to feel bad for

1050
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,000
everyone involved. And so we've really committed to making fast, rapid reactions right after that

1051
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
season launch within a week or two, and then letting it ride from there, um, until the end of

1052
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,000
the season, until the next season when we kind of repeat the cycle again. Yeah. Honestly, it's like,

1053
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
I'm really glad of the way we do it too, because like even for season eight, having it be a bit of

1054
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
a shorter season, it would be so rough to, you know, you're like, okay, I've got these two months with,

1055
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
you know, with my build and with these boss powers. So then to have, you know, almost like the rug pulled,

1056
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
um, halfway through and being able to, uh, you know, really get into the nitty gritties of it

1057
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:51,000
and stick with that build. So, yeah. And that gives us, uh, as developers, uh, and like designers

1058
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
looking at this data and thinking about these balance changes, it allows us to kind of take

1059
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,000
our focus off season eight and focus more on season nine. And so, you know, we're going to be putting

1060
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:06,000
out higher quality balance changes and higher quality releases, um, by kind of moving on from a season to

1061
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,000
focus on the next one earlier. That just gives us more time to look at that data and really deliver high

1062
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,000
quality releases season over season. So the little plug I'm going to put, please play the PTR because

1063
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:21,000
we're all a bunch of nerds. And I promise you when you're playing the PTR, we are watching and we are

1064
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,000
just reading all the things being said. And it is so fun and meaningful to us to see people reacting

1065
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,000
and giving us new ways to improve the things we've made. Oh, absolutely. 100 percent. 110 percent.

1066
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:40,000
100, 150. We will be reading your feedback. Do not worry about that. Uh, Kuroi Nekamata. Uh, I think Liam,

1067
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
this will be, uh, it could be one for you, but maybe for the whole team. Uh, would you consider

1068
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
the possibility that one can disable the effects of other players or at least dim them down so that

1069
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
one is not always flashed when IE Sorcs, like four Sorcs are running around? And I could see that with

1070
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
the, uh, the, uh, the powers coming in this season, they are so bright and visual that, uh,

1071
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,000
yeah, it's gonna be a busy screen. It's probably a bit, the Herodric spells are pretty insane. And I know,

1072
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
like we've had earthquake barbarians running around covering the ground with, well, broken ground.

1073
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Don't do. Yeah. So, uh, this is definitely things we're considering. Like we all, you know, play the

1074
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
game and we play in parties. So we know what it's like when everything is just cluttered and insane.

1075
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Uh, I can't speak to broadly everything. I've heard bits and pieces. You could talk about that,

1076
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Charles or Aislinn, but I know with the Herodric spells, we are making use of some tech to do that

1077
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:35,000
on some of the powers, such as with the pets, the cosmic anomalies. You're not going to see a hundred cosmic

1078
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
anomalies floating and going everywhere. They're going to be kind of dimmed out very similar to

1079
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:45,000
like the, uh, necromancer minions. We'll be using that kind of thing for them. Yeah. This is a kind of

1080
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:52,000
overarching pain point that, uh, I think surfaces from time to time, which is very reasonable and fair.

1081
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And it's something that the team considers, especially with every new release, uh, the Herodric

1082
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:02,000
spellcraft. I'm glad we're doing that. Um, and it's, it's, uh, you know, it's something that they,

1083
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
they take into with a lot of consideration and they want to protect the visual clarity of the game.

1084
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Uh, but they also want to make sure that people can see the things they want to see. Uh, so if there

1085
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
are certain things that crop up that you find particularly egregious in that way, especially

1086
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,000
during the PTR, please play the PTR, uh, let us know and we can get that information to the team

1087
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and we can, we can talk about it. Oh yeah. I got a question here from Airsoft Daniel, uh,

1088
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,000
at Diablo, what changes will be made to reliquaries in season nine to provide more value to paying

1089
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
players? Uh, so kind of similar to what I addressed at the start of the stream, we do have some changes

1090
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,000
coming in to get some more content into reliquaries. Um, it's unclear as to whether or not that's going

1091
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
to be hitting in season nine. It will be in the future. So season nine is probably too soon for

1092
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,000
those changes to hit. Um, however, we are looking to inject more of that content into the reliquaries

1093
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
moving forward. So it's definitely something to look out, to look out for probably not season nine,

1094
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:04,000
but definitely in the future. And I think we've got time for one last question. Let's see.

1095
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Um, ice panther, uh, this one's for you, Charles. Are you bringing out any more new items,

1096
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:22,000
ancestral or mythics into the new season? Uh, so for the new season, we're going to be releasing one

1097
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,000
new unique item per class. The ones we highlighted on stream here. Uh, no more, um, uh, there's no

1098
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,000
additional items, uh, unique or legendaries that we didn't talk about. Um, but there will be some new,

1099
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,000
uh, relatively new legendary effects because we did some substantial reworks of, you know,

1100
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
we basically said, Hey, this was something that talked to grizzly rage was my main example. And we

1101
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
just kind of completely changed its effect. So in, in some way, though, those are kind of new,

1102
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:52,000
um, but they don't, uh, they're not brand new in terms of, um, like, uh, a brand new legendary to

1103
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,000
collect. And we didn't go over those reworked legendaries explicitly on the stream, but they

1104
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,000
are going to be testable in the PTR. They'll be testable in PTR. They'll be in the patch notes

1105
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
blog once, uh, this is done. There just was like a handful and because they were kind of reworks,

1106
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
um, we're naturally limited on time. This stream is already going quite a while.

1107
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So we wanted to make sure that, that we, you know, there are more class balance changes and more

1108
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
content, um, than we even talked about here. So make sure you check out the blog afterwards for

1109
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,000
all those details. Absolutely. And that brings us to the end of our, the Q and A portion of the

1110
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
stream, which brings us to the end of the stream. So yeah, if you're still watching, thank you for

1111
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,000
sticking with us. This one has been a beefy stream for sure. Uh, patch notes and the PTR blog are

1112
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
going to be hitting following this stream. It is a very, very substantial blog. So we will have all

1113
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
localized languages available early next week. Um, but you can check those out when those do go

1114
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:48,000
live. Uh, the PTR is going to be available from May 27th to June, June 3rd on PC Battle.net. I want

1115
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
to give a huge thank you to all the developers that have been here today. Dan coming in all the way

1116
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
from Albany. Thank you for hanging with us this whole time. It's been really great hanging out with

1117
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:00,000
you and getting to chat the new season. Um, and to all of you at home, thank you for tuning in. Um,

1118
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
like Aislinn said to start the stream, we love that you played Diablo 4. We love being a part of this

1119
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
process and you guys are a very big part of that. Uh, thank you to our production crew.

1120
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
There's a ton of hands that, uh, that work behind the scenes to make these streams possible. They

1121
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
work very tirelessly. Um, so thank you to them for helping bring, uh, these streams to life.

1122
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And yeah, we will see you all for the 230 PTR. We'll see you in Sanctuary. Hell yes. Oh, and stick

1123
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
around. Sorry. Stick around following the stream because we will have the Diablo creator. Uh, we're going to be

1124
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:32,000
rating RizzarJ on both, or sorry, RizzarJ on both YouTube and Twitch. So stick around for more great

1125
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Diablo 4 content. But yeah, we'll see you in the 230 PTR. See you in Sanctuary. Yep. Bye guys. Thank you.
