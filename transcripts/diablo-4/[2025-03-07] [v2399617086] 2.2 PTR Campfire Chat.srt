Thank you.

63
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Thank you.

64
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Thank you.

65
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Thank you.

66
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Thank you.

67
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Thank you.

68
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Thank you.

69
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Thank you.

70
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah.

71
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Thank you.

72
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Actually you toMe &

73
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And what we've seen is compared to Season 6, which had a lot of positive feedback as part of our rebound progression model,

74
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
is that a lot of that has sort of gone down the drain in terms of how fast players are chewing through some of the content.

75
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So we actually have a graph that we could look at. I apologize, this is terrible, but I just pulled it from the stat, our sort of stat page.

76
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It's not the greatest. But this is a picture of Season 6. You can see on the Y axis here,

77
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
it was taking roughly people around 15 to 17 hours on average to get to max level.

78
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
We felt like that was a pretty good journey, right? Part of Diablo is that sort of zero to hero journey.

79
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And part of what's fun about leveling is you start to sort of form a build and find a lot of different pieces early on

80
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
when you're still forming your character where customization is really fun, right?

81
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You're not necessarily locked into a build. So we felt like that was a pretty good clip for hitting max level.

82
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It's on average, right? So you could either go faster or slower depending on sort of how much of a blaster you are.

83
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So we felt like that was a pretty good average, especially with difficulty tiers and your ability to sort of go faster or slower based on your pacing.

84
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And let's go to Season 7 now. And it nearly doubled.

85
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So you can see that it was taking about nine hours on average, which is kind of insane, right? Again, this is the average.

86
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So if you're, you know, if you're like the Wudijo of the world, it's probably more like two hours or like 30 minutes.

87
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And that was something that we definitely feel like has sort of missed the mark in terms of that initial journey.

88
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So we are going to be making some changes just to adjust for a lot of the seasonal power and things like that.

89
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
We're not going to necessarily nerf the power of the seasonal power. We still want you to feel powerful.

90
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
But we are going to essentially take a look at the 1 to 25 experience and just smooth that out a little bit,

91
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
which is going to essentially make the leveling experience a little bit closer to Season 6.

92
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So it is going to be a slower from 1 to 25. But one thing we've done to sort of compensate that is we've taken a look at the itemization.

93
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
We don't like that rares and sort of magic items immediately disappear after the first five minutes of the game.

94
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah, I think you kind of get to that point like we were talking about.

95
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
If you get to like level 20, you blink and you're level 20.

96
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And then at the same time you blink and you're like, oh, blues and yellows.

97
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Like, I only look at oranges now. Or like, what's this other color?

98
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So I know that we have some changes that you wanted to talk about.

99
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Yeah, and again, like a lot of this is in the spirit of making sure that zero to hero journey is really satisfying, right?

100
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
That's what makes it so awesome when playing Diablo is that sort of I start with nothing and become a god, right?

101
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So we are taking a look at the itemization so that it doesn't just feel like a slog from 1 to 25.

102
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
What we're going to be doing is, you know what?

103
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm going to jump actually into the legendaries really quick because it's really important, a really important part of this.

104
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
The other thing that was contributing to this leveling sort of pace was that players are getting a legendary every three to four minutes.

105
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And that's from 1 to 60. That's not just in the end game.

106
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And it just felt like legendary item quality was just too prevalent across the leveling journey.

107
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
You didn't have, you sort of hit max level. There was no journey to assembling your build.

108
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You just had everything as part of the Codex of Power.

109
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So we're also reducing the legendary rate from leveling. We're not really touching the end game legendary drop rates, but from leveling we are adjusting that.

110
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And to compensate that, to jump back into the magic and rares.

111
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
We're making it so that magics can have up to two affixes.

112
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So sometimes you're going to find, you know, from your 1 to 25 journey a pretty good magic item.

113
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It might actually be better than a rare, for example, because it might have dropped earlier for you.

114
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It might have higher eye power.

115
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And then we're also making it so that rares can sometimes have up to three affixes.

116
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And what that means is, you know, when you get a drop at level 35 from a Whisper Cache,

117
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
right now, you know, in Season 7 it feels terrible when you don't get a legendary item,

118
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
because you just know that it's just not even worth looking at, right?

119
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But now, now that rare items can have up to three affixes, that means that you might have a really good imprintable base.

120
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It means all the rares that drop across the game from 1 to 60 could actually be pretty great gear for you,

121
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
especially with all of our crafting options.

122
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So we think that this helps smooth out the 1 to 60 journey.

123
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I will caveat that the rare quality is not the best at max level still.

124
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
It's going to be a lower eye power, so you're not going to have to filter through a bunch of rares at max level.

125
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
We're not going to go back to pre-season 4.

126
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So, yeah, we think this is this sort of smoothing out of the leveling curve,

127
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
taking a look at the magic rarities or the item qualities,

128
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
is just going to make the experience feel a lot more rewarding and satisfying as you go through these levels.

129
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And then I know some of the other items we've been talking about have been like a little bit of that torment progression.

130
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah.

131
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We've seen, you know, drastic differences between like season 6 to season 7,

132
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and it's something I know we're making tweaks to.

133
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yeah.

134
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, so the other half of Diablo is obviously the max level endgame, right?

135
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And we've heard a ton of feedback that like, you know, it just feels like a weekend game right now.

136
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You can just blast through all the torment tiers.

137
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
There's nothing that's really satisfying about it.

138
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
There's nothing to work towards just because you're just getting so much power so frequently and just really crushing this content.

139
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So what we've done here is if we go to the slide, we've actually given,

140
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
actually, let me jump into some of the stats here because I think it's really interesting.

141
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
A lot of people got to Torment 4 very quickly.

142
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So on average, it was taking players around 15 hours to get to Torment 4.

143
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That's like roughly double how quickly it took in season 6, which is kind of insane.

144
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Again, it's the culmination of Seasonal Powers and all this crazy stuff going on.

145
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So, and the other part of it is that 50% of players were actually hitting Torment 4.

146
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And just from a philosophy standpoint, we really want like whatever the hardest Torment tier is, in this case, Torment 4, to be aspirational.

147
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And to us, that means around 10%.

148
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That means that, you know, if you're really Johnny Badass, you know, you need to be in the top 10% of players to actually get there.

149
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And it's not hitting the mark.

150
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So what we're going to do is make some adjustments.

151
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,000
So Torment 1 is now going to start at Pit Tier 10, which means we've effectively added 10 Pit tiers to the Pit because now Torment 1 starts earlier.

152
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And then we've also increased the Torment Pit Scaling, Health by roughly 20% multiplicative, and then some damage increases.

153
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yeah, and that Pit Scaling is, every level of a Pit is multiplicative on previous levels.

154
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So it's not just like, oh, whatever Pit I was at, it's now 20% harder.

155
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It's actually like kind of stacking 20% every level.

156
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So the end result is that, you know, a Pit Tier 100 is much harder than it was before.

157
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And that will, that makes it, you know, harder to reach that absolute highest end.

158
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And it gives you a little bit more for those builds and those Blasters who are getting up to that highest Pit Tier.

159
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
There's going to be, it's going to be quite a bit harder to get to quite that same level next season.

160
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Yeah, absolutely.

161
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So with that sort of culminates in moving Torment 1 to Pit Tier 10 and effectively adding 10 Pit Tiers and increasing the multiplicative scaling of the Pit Tier scaling is the journey is going to be a lot more sort of satisfying.

162
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
There's a lot more sort of peaks to climb.

163
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And it also means Pit Tier 150 is going to be very difficult.

164
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So, so difficult that I don't believe any of you will reach it.

165
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'll, I don't know, I'll do something silly on the stream.

166
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
He says this now.

167
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'll probably, oh, that's not enough for doing something so extreme.

168
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And then, like, within the first week.

169
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That's a challenge to all of you out there.

170
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yeah, you all can vote on the silly things that I do.

171
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
But conversely, I just want to cover this really quickly, though.

172
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So, Torment 4 isn't going to be insanely harder than it was before.

173
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's going to be roughly around Pit Tier 76 is on live right now.

174
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So, Season 7.

175
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So, think about the game that you're playing right now.

176
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Torment 4 is going to be about 11 Pit Tiers harder.

177
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So, it's still achievable.

178
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It's just that upper end is also just going to be that much harder to sort of climb through.

179
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Awesome.

180
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So, we've got a lot of changes coming for, like, Torment scaling.

181
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Obviously, some itemization changes.

182
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So, the big thing being as you're leveling up, you're going to see a lot more opportunities to find items.

183
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Especially with the changes to blue and yellow items there.

184
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And then, of course, as you mentioned, the big caveat is, like, at 60, the item power on Legendaries is still going to be the best method and the best items to actually grab.

185
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So, yeah, lots of big changes coming up.

186
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Great to actually walk through all of them.

187
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I know we have a ton more to talk about specifically around the new season.

188
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So, thank you, Colin.

189
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We're going to jump over to Derek because I know we do want to talk about the new season and what players are actually going to be experiencing in this PTR.

190
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Again, just to redefine what PTR is for some people because I got messages from people going, like, well, PTRs are sometimes buggy.

191
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And I'm like, well, it's a PTR.

192
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So, it is like a beta or an alpha, an early look into a game.

193
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So, we expect that.

194
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
There will be, like, known issues and we'll actually have those known issues on our forums.

195
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So, people can actually see them.

196
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You can report bugs.

197
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It actually helps when you guys actually jump into a PTR and experience it.

198
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And give us feedback because that helps tweak the start of the season for the better, essentially.

199
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But with season eight, we will be having, of course, a PTR and we'll be talking about it here in a second.

200
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And if you remember with season seven, we kind of had this, like, this overarching theme with, like, big changes in that season.

201
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
One was specifically around, well, it was mostly focused around, like, the whispers.

202
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And, of course, with season eight, we have another overarching theme that we're really going to be talking about where we'll be kind of even seeing an old friend.

203
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So, Derek, do you want to chat about it here?

204
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah, absolutely.

205
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So, yeah, as you mentioned, seasons are kind of like our opportunity to shine focus on an existing system and really amplify or celebrate or enhance it within that respective season.

206
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So, we've seen that with, you know, season four with the Helltide revamps and whatnot, as you mentioned.

207
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Season seven was the emphasis on the Tree of Whispers and Bounties.

208
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So, as Colin kind of mapped out the journey to the endgame, we wanted to shine focus on a major endgame feature, namely surrounding our bosses.

209
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And we have a lot of really cool bosses in, you know, the world of Sanctuary.

210
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But more specifically, the Laird Boss System, or as some of us, and we reference it to as the Boss Ladder.

211
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So, season eight focus is on the Laird Boss System.

212
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
We're going to be doing a whole mess of new things to it.

213
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So, we're adding new bosses, new mechanics, quality of life, updates, and a revamped materials loop that I'm going to be covering throughout the course of this segment.

214
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So, you know, first I just want to kind of talk about, you know, the new bosses and additions to the roster.

215
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So, when we're talking about the Laird Bosses, these are like the biggest, baddest, you know, bosses of Sanctuary.

216
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So, we're looking at how do we add to the roster in a meaningful way, but also which bosses do we add that are impactful and versatile enough to carry the entire theme of a season.

217
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So, with that in mind, we're just asking ourselves a question of which of the right bosses to bring.

218
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You mentioned an old friend. So, we had to choose something that was versatile. We had to choose something that was big, bad.

219
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So, that's where we go to Belial.

220
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yes, season eight, Belial's return. Belial's back in Sanctuary.

221
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
He is climbing his way to the top of the Laird Boss Ladder.

222
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
He is the new, you know, exalted pinnacle challenge within the ladder.

223
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:18,000
He is the highest challenge, the highest reward, and he also has some very unique reward-related tricks up his sleeve that I'll give you.

224
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'll cover a little bit later. So, for now, just know that Belial's back.

225
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And he's also just not joining the party alone. He's bringing a couple of friends from our Vessel of Hatred.

226
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:35,000
So, first up is our buddy Urvar. So, Urvar's joining the roster of the Laird Boss Ladder system.

227
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
He's going to be filling out kind of like the lowest rung of the ladder.

228
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So, he's going to be joining the party with the Varshans and the Beast of Nice and whatnot.

229
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So, Urvar's back. And we're also bringing back another Vessel of Hatred character, the Harbinger of Hatred.

230
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm so happy for this.

231
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Yeah, no, this one...

232
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Oh, I love this fight.

233
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'll talk a little bit more of this guy in just a little bit, but the Harbinger of Hatred will be joining kind of the second rung of the ladder with the likes of Durial and Undarial.

234
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And one thing I just do want to stress is that both of these Vessel of Hatred bosses will dip into the shared loot pools of other bosses within their respective tier,

235
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,000
but also have some additional bonuses that is specific to the Vessel of Hatred, like being a great source of tributes and runes.

236
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But Belial, for all intents and purposes, is available to everyone, and he is just the new pinnacle challenge of the Boss Ladder.

237
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So you're saying even harder than Durial and Undarial right now. He's going to be harder, more rewarding than even those.

238
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Absolutely. Yes.

239
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Oh, wonderful.

240
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
New top tier.

241
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
New top tier.

242
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Belial, Lord of Lies, he does not mess around.

243
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And I'm really excited about this because I think this is going to pair really well with the sort of leveling journey and the Torment progression where we're making things a little bit more aspirational, a little bit more challenging.

244
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's really like a return to the heart of the Diablo experience, right? Sort of leveling from nothing and taking on these huge big bads to claim their loot.

245
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah, absolutely. I think that's kind of like the inherent cool thing about the Lair Boss Ladder system is that you start with like the initiate level floor, you take those on, you graduate to the next level, and then now you have kind of Belial just always there looming over you.

246
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yeah.

247
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
That's kind of the aspirational, yes, I get to go fight him now.

248
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
But for those who know about our buddy Belial, Lord of Lies, you know that he kind of appears in different forms.

249
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So this is what we're kind of referencing as like his supreme form that appears at the top of the Lair Boss Ladder.

250
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But he also has his, I guess, smaller, more agile, compact form. I like to affectionately refer to him as Baby Belial, but this is Belial in his more compact form.

251
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And throughout the course of the season, or I guess just the Lair Boss mechanics, he's going to be popping up all over the place.

252
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But I'm really excited about this version of Belial's new role in the Lair Boss Ladder system in the sense that defeating and looting any of the Lair Bosses has a small percent chance to initiate a surprise ambush from Belial himself.

253
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And this is really cool because this is kind of like a two for the price of one payout.

254
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Let's say I fight Andario, I defeat Andario, I loot Andario, and I get this special ambush triggered.

255
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And if I defeat Belial, I'll get a double payout of Andario's loot.

256
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So I got the loot from Andario, and I get another payout of Andario's loot from defeating Belial himself.

257
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So it's a really exciting kind of just like injection of some fun novel mechanics within the Lair Boss system that we're doing over and over and over again.

258
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So again, really excited about this update.

259
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And again, in the spirit of teasing kind of the rewards relationship and connection that Belial has, this version of Belial has a very special connection to his larger Supreme form in the Lair Boss Ladder that I'll touch upon a little bit later.

260
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
A lot of teasing that I'm kind of just sending that there's a lot to go over.

261
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
We're gonna lie to everybody.

262
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah.

263
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
We're just kidding.

264
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Belial's actually not here. This is a lie.

265
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yeah, so that was that. That was the, you know, the Belial ambushes.

266
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But I also want to talk about some additional major sweeping updates that's coming in with just the system as a whole.

267
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And I want to talk about the summoning materials.

268
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:22,000
As we know, the way that the system currently functions is, you know, you go do activities, you get summoning items, you go visit the boss, and you plop them in, you summon the boss, and then, you know, that's kind of just a flow.

269
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So when we're looking at the Lair Boss system, we don't just look about ways that we can add to it.

270
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We also look about, you know, opportunities to, you know, resolve or reduce some frictions, or just areas for improvement that we can have with it.

271
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Since it's a very mature system, we get a lot of feedback that we, you know, diligently ingest and talk about and whatnot on our team.

272
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So when it came to the summoning materials, we identified a couple of key points of, I guess, friction that players are currently having with it.

273
00:51:49,000 --> 00:52:00,000
One is, since you have to ante up your summoning materials just to summon the boss, it's kind of a feels-bad moment when you realize that you just wasted, you know, X number of materials to find out that you can't defeat Durial.

274
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Like, okay, that's wasted materials, back to the loop, maybe I'll fight him another week or two depending on how fast you are.

275
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And it's just generally not a great feeling for myself or for players and whatnot.

276
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yeah, I definitely have run into this where it's like, I'm only going to fight the boss when I can guarantee win against it.

277
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Right.

278
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Right, so you never actually fight-

279
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And how do you know that too until, like, trial and error?

280
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Like, you never really have that, like, actual fun fight with the boss where you're like, oh, am I going to lose or not?

281
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Because it's like, well, I'm just not going to risk it.

282
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, I've had the times where I'm like, I don't know if my build's quite ready, so I'll try to fight a boss.

283
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
And then I'm like, oh, this is really tough.

284
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Like, I die a couple times and I'm like, do I really want to keep, like, retrying it?

285
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Because, like, well, I've already invested. I'm kind of, like, I'm kind of committed.

286
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So with this new way, you know, I don't need to invest those right up front.

287
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I can just go and fight them right away and see how strong I am without risking the materials.

288
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah, yeah, so we're going to cover, like, the specificities of the new system and how it all works in a little bit.

289
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
But the other kind of pain point that we identified with the current system is also just in regards to, like, the party play.

290
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I think my little earpiece is coming out of my ear. There you go.

291
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
It's a common theme on this one. The earpiece just pops out all the time.

292
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
We do it live here. Yeah, so the other element is, like, just a party play, right?

293
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And as much as we want to kind of, like, entrust in our fellow man and whatnot and engage in the boss rotations and whatnot,

294
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
we have seen, you know, some areas of friction where certain players don't engage in the boss rotations

295
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,000
and they don't submit their materials. Like, no one watching the stream would ever be guilty of this, but that does happen.

296
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It's shocking, but it does happen.

297
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Belial is on the other side of the computer. It's like, yeah, I'll definitely pay the next rotation.

298
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And then they leave and they take all their stuff. So that was another kind of area of friction that we experienced with the current summoning materials.

299
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So I think that's kind of enough of a preface just to set the tone for where the system is going now that we're introducing Season 8.

300
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
So what are we doing?

301
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
What are we? I don't know. Let's find out.

302
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:02,000
All right. So Lair Keys. So summoning materials are effectively being repurposed in their roles as a new item called Lair Keys.

303
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And what Lair Keys do, well, I'll just start with this, is since there's no more summoning materials, that just means that effectively all Lair bosses are free to summon.

304
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah. So if you're not sure if you're ready to take on a Varshan or a Durial, just go visit them.

305
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You know, kind of use them as a bit of a training dummy to see if you can actually, you know, take them on.

306
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But what Lair Keys now do is they grant access to the defeated bosses' horde or their treasure chests that they drop.

307
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So now I'll just walk you through kind of the new flow. Imagine this with me.

308
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So you enter Durial's Lair. You walk up to his altar and you just click the altar to summon him.

309
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Again, no cost to you. You fight Durial, you defeat him, out pops his horde.

310
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And now the Shards of Agony, which is now the Lair Key, you use that to open his horde and get all the oodles of loot that he went to go visit him to do.

311
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah. And these work like Helltide chests. So you have to pay in order to get the loot. And the only loot comes from the person who pays.

312
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Yeah. That's a very important distinction is that now every member in the party needs to have the appropriate type and quantity of the Lair Keys to access the loot in the horde.

313
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And you can still trade your keys with friends and things like that. If you have 9999, you know, Durial mats, you can split them in half and give them to your buddies to open the chest.

314
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah, absolutely. My sharing is caring in the system here.

315
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And then, of course, if you're really lucky, you'll get a Belial ambush and you can get double loot.

316
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah. Yeah, there you go. So again, a lot of new avenues and ways to kind of, you know, experience the system.

317
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So we also have the Stygian stones. So Stygian stones in season 8 is living a new life now in the sense that we wanted to ensure that every boss in the first rung of the ladder, our initiate Lair bosses, the Varshans, Griggers, Beasts of Nice, Lord Zers and Urvars now, that they're all equally relevant to getting you to climb to the next rung.

318
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So in addition to it, you can take a screenshot of this chart here. I won't try and walk through the entire thing, but now Stygian stones is a drop that can drop from any of the initiate Lair boss tier here.

319
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And you can crush them into your Lair key of choice for the second rung of the Lair bosses.

320
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:24,000
So let's say I fight Grigger, I get a Stygian stone and I want to go fight Ondariel. I can just crush that into some Ondariel keys.

321
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And again, just giving a little bit more flexibility and how players actually engage and progress through the Lair boss ladder.

322
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Again, as we know, all roads lead to Belial, Lord of Lies, you know, the top of the pinnacle of the ladder at the end.

323
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Ooh, there's a lot. All right. Final thing here is the item bloat reduction.

324
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
So again, with this new system, we're consolidating all the Lair keys to one Lair key type per boss.

325
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
So no more kind of managing two different materials.

326
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And so I have enough material. I have two of these, five of these. It's just one material per boss.

327
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
We're increasing the item stacking of these to 99 again to cut down some of that bloat.

328
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And one of my personal favorites here is that we're also normalizing the counts of required Lair keys per, you know, boss rank.

329
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So all the initiate tiered bosses, they require the same quantity of their respective keys.

330
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So to the graders and whatnot. So again, it's just cutting down on the total mental math and memory that is kind of affecting the, I guess, like on ramping enjoyment of the current system.

331
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah. And Dario only needs one material, for example, as part of this.

332
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah, absolutely. So you can see in this chart here, you have Pincushion Dolls, Shard of Agony, or the Stygian Stone is kind of the wild card that you can crush to any one of them.

333
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So let's say if Dario needed four Pincushion Dolls, you have three of them, but you have one Stygian Stone, you can crush that into a Pincushion Doll and go get Dario's Horde.

334
00:57:48,000 --> 00:58:04,000
So, all right, that was a pretty big overview and a lot of talking in charts, but I want to take the time to, you know, throw it over to Ruben and behind the scenes here and kind of just get into just what this all looks like as part of this in-game flow.

335
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Hey, hello, Derek. How are you doing, man?

336
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I'm doing great. How are you?

337
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Awesome. Yeah, let me open up the menu for you.

338
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:21,000
All right, cool. So in this walkthrough, I'm just going to show you kind of, or we're going to show you rather, the new flow to access the lair bosses with a little bit of a sneak peek of the Harbinger of Hatred.

339
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So one thing I want to just call out real quick is kind of some of the quality of life updates that we've taken to just the map presentation and the boss dungeon tooltips themselves.

340
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And I'll kind of just go through these kind of itemized order.

341
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So first, all of the boss dungeon map icons have been given a little bit of a beautiful beautification treatment.

342
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So they're a little bit more bold, red, and easier to identify against the sea of other icons on the map.

343
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
But now I want to talk about the tooltip and I'll just start from the top and go make my way down.

344
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So the first quality of life update that we added was just simply printing the name of the boss that resides within the dungeon.

345
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You know, one of the kind of ambiguities that we have the previous, you know, version of this system was not knowing specifically which boss lives in which dungeon.

346
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Like, oh, who does live in the gaping crevice or who lives in the malignant tunnels?

347
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So now you can see here that the Harbinger of Hatred lives in the Harbinger's Den.

348
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
This is probably not the best example because who else would live in the Harbinger's Den?

349
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Wow.

350
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah, he technically does live in every single one of them.

351
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
He's a liar. You don't know where he's at.

352
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,000
But yeah, so you can see here now, you know, we print the name of the lair boss that lives in the dungeon for a little bit easier find.

353
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Inside of the main body description, we also just give a little bit more guidance and information on, you know, what the value of defeating this boss is

354
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and they're directing players to the fact that they are a source of ancestral and mythic unique items.

355
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So, the last two updates here are some of my favorites of this is that we also display now the required items that you need to access the lair boss's horde.

356
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
If you recall the previous, you know, iteration, that was not apparent to you.

357
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,000
So, you would kind of like waste the time traveling to the boss just to find out that, oh, I have three or four Abhorrent's Hearts, so I can't fight the boss yet.

358
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
So, we wanted to, again, just smoothen out the access and onboarding to the feature.

359
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And I think my absolute favorite update of all this is, you see at the bottom, we now have the ability to travel directly into the dungeon directly from the map.

360
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So, again, no more teleporting to the nearest waypoint.

361
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
We just pop directly in and just get into it.

362
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And, you know, we have Ruben loading into here and I think this is a great time to just outline.

363
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I've talked about the new bosses, I've talked about new mechanics, but we have a collection of really great existing lair bosses.

364
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And one thing that we wanted to take as an opportunity within the season was to also enhance every other lair boss that exists within the system.

365
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So, every lair boss is getting a bit of a difficulty spike and new mechanics to, again, freshen up the fights that we've been, you know, knowing and loving.

366
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So, if you fought, you know, the Varshan's or the Durial's or even the Lilith's, you know, over and over and over again, all this is in the PTR.

367
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:20,000
So, definitely worth checking them out again to see what's changed and, you know, how much different their experience is.

368
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Yeah, Durial has some messed up surprises.

369
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Yeah, Durial eats you.

370
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Why do you spoil it?

371
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Why do you spoil it?

372
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
It's definitely worth checking out the mechanics.

373
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
But again, so this is the Harbinger of Hatred.

374
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And, you know, just as a reminder, one thing that we do when we add a boss to the lair boss system is we don't just take the carbon copy, you know, campaign version of it.

375
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
We also take the opportunity to inject some really crazy mechanics.

376
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So, I don't necessarily want to, you know, kind of spoil the surprises of the Harbinger of Hatred's mechanics here.

377
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
But he does get pretty wild.

378
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
He does.

379
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
This is a spectacle and a half of a fight.

380
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And I'm really excited to have players check it out.

381
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So, yeah, I think this is about all we might want to show of this guy.

382
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Yeah, we probably won't go into it.

383
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
We don't want to spoil all the mechanics and everything.

384
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Even though we're kind of also spoiling a little bit of, like, a Rogue build.

385
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
We might have noticed some interesting things on Rogue, which I'll get to in a bit.

386
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
It's spoil or it's teasing to maintain.

387
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Exactly.

388
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
It's teasing.

389
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Teasing.

390
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Teasing everyone along here.

391
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But, yeah, so, you know, that was a sneak peek at the Harbinger of Hatred we just talked about again, in case you missed it.

392
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
The all-layer bosses are getting a boost in both their performance and just the mechanics that they have.

393
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Yeah.

394
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
But let's, you know, we fast-forwarded past, you know, the Harbinger of Hatred's fight.

395
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:51,000
So let's imagine a world that, you know, we fought through the whole thing, we killed him, and let's show off now what to expect from the Horde loop flow.

396
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So we have some footage here with this very shiny chest.

397
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Very shiny chest.

398
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
So we have four of Horan's hearts, and now we can open up the chest.

399
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Again, each one of us needs to have it.

400
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And I mentioned that Belial has a chance to surprise ambush you after opening any Horde.

401
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And here you go.

402
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Look at this.

403
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
This is meant to be a relatively rare occurrence.

404
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
But, you know, this is the magic of pre-recorded footage.

405
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
We can make the impossible happen.

406
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And in this case, again, painting the full picture of the scenario, you defeated the Harbinger of Hatred, you got the Horde, you opened it, you got baby Belial, you killed him, and now you get another proc of...

407
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Double the loot.

408
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Yeah, double the loot, double the fun.

409
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Yeah, double the loot of what you just essentially got.

410
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
With the one-time payment of the Lair Keys that you deposited.

411
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
So, yeah, it really is, you know, kind of a two-for-one sale that Belial has for you.

412
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
And if you noticed, you might have seen, we did keep a bonus for party play.

413
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So, while you do have to pay to get the chest and open up the Horde, we kept a bonus chance for loot.

414
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So, we love that people enjoy fighting the bosses as parties, and we know that that's a fun social experience in Diablo.

415
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
So, what we've done is the Hordes themselves will have bonus chances for loot when you are in a party.

416
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And that does scale with party members.

417
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yep, absolutely.

418
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So, yeah, a lot of loot everywhere to give.

419
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And on the topic at the very top, I teased that Belial had a very special kind of role in the reward structure, different from every other boss.

420
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,000
So, defeating the ambush version of Belial is not just lucrative in the sense that it's a double payout.

421
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:33,000
He is also the sole source of the Lair Keys that you need to access his Supreme Form at the top of the ladder, the Supreme Form's Horde.

422
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:39,000
So, I want to show off now the Supreme Belial's very green chest here.

423
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So, you can see here, it doesn't open up right away.

424
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I have some options.

425
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So, the really cool thing about the Supreme Belial's Horde is that you can set it to mimic the reward drops of any other existing Lair Boss.

426
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:05,000
So, let's say if you are trying to do Durial runs to get the special stuff that he has, and you can set your Belial to drop the Durial loot, and he will do so at an enhanced rate.

427
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So, it's even better than if you just went to go fight Durial specifically.

428
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Yeah, so if you are really targeting Farming in those specific Uniques, you get, you know, this version of Belial just gives you a much better chance of doing that as well.

429
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Yeah, absolutely. And, not just that in terms of like his value, he also guarantees one Ancestral unique drop per kill, and he's also a really great source of the Infernal compasses.

430
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So, you know, if you want to, you know, empower your Infernal Horde runs and whatnot, it's never a waste of time to go visit the Belial Supreme at the top of the ladder here.

431
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Yeah, and this is in Torment 2, and it all scales with Torment.

432
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Exactly.

433
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
So, the higher the Torment, the more you go.

434
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Yeah, what we're seeing in this footage is just Torment 2, so obviously, like Torment 4, you would get more loot out of it.

435
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Because you're, it's a much more difficult challenge.

436
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It is much more.

437
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
For sure.

438
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It scales with the Torment tiers, and also if we were in a party in this example here, we'd get even, you know, more chances of great stuff out of it as well.

439
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Yep, exactly right.

440
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Alright, cool. Well, that is the Lair Key and the Lair Boss. I just have a lot of things to cover here.

441
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Yeah, you have, I know we want to talk a little bit about kind of the, it's funny because people saw it as Ruben was on the map, because they probably saw a term like with apparitions and everything.

442
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Right, yeah, there's a lot of teasing in this.

443
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I know, a lot of teasing. This happens when you use a live build and everything's fun.

444
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Yeah, it's exciting.

445
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:40,000
But one thing, before we hop into the next thing, I do want to reestablish so that everything that we just talked about as far as what we're introducing to the Lair Boss system and all the mechanics, new bosses and whatnot, that is permanent.

446
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:48,000
That is just how the system works now. So everything is getting introduced in Season 8, but it's not leaving beyond Season 8. It is just there.

447
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It'll be an Eternal, so.

448
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It will, yeah, it'll be an Eternal. That's just how the system works.

449
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
What the next segment though is, is all the Seasonal specific stuff.

450
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
So again, as Adam mentioned, you might have seen some Apparition and Incursion things pop up.

451
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
So let's get into the first kind of seasonal related content here.

452
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Oh, the top says Lair Boss. Okay.

453
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Anyways, we do it live.

454
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Apparition and Incursions.

455
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Apparition and Incursions is a new open world seasonal event to empower your leveling journeys

456
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:25,000
and also kind of just spread the narrative and dramas of Belial is back on Sanctuary

457
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
and he's spreading his own sense of, you know, twisted realities across the land.

458
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
He's always in his efforts to try and plunge, you know, the world is Sanctuary into his Realm of Lies

459
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:44,000
and he's doing it through this fast-paced boss rush style event that kind of takes the spirit of, you know, the open world social boss play of the Blood Maiden

460
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
and making a really cool kind of just really fast-paced, you know, bam, bam, bam, boss rush style event.

461
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:55,000
So I think we have some footage here just to put some, yeah, some visuals to it.

462
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:01,000
So, you know, this is an area of the world that Belial's apparitions are kind of overtaking

463
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,000
and throughout the course players are going to be defeating these apparitions to draw out up to two of his apparition bosses.

464
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
This is pulled from a total of ten potential apparition bosses.

465
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So each time you go through this you'll fight, you know, two of them kind of randomized.

466
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So each time should be a little bit different.

467
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And all of this is leading up to a showdown against Belial himself.

468
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So again, it's celebrating bosses. It's three bosses per event.

469
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And the idea for this is that they're up pretty much 24-7.

470
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So we want to just encourage that, you know, hop on the boss train, ride it to the end, find the next one,

471
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
and just, you know, go to your heart's content.

472
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And, you know, celebration of bosses this season, really.

473
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Absolutely. And what do you get for killing those bosses?

474
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Oh, you're going to get some cool stuff, Colin. Let's go to the next slide.

475
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
That kind of leads us into the collectible boss powers, seasonal powers.

476
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, spoiled it right there.

477
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Man, it's already on the slide.

478
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Yeah, we're fine.

479
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So the theme for the powers theme for Season 8 is boss powers.

480
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:09,000
So Belial being kind of like the illusionary character he is, mimicry and whatnot,

481
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:18,000
in Season 8, players will be acquiring the ability to steal and mimic the powers of up to 24 targeted bosses across Sanctuary.

482
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:29,000
So we have 24 collectible powers that are gathered from the first time kill of targeted bosses across the full content from level 1 till the very top.

483
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
So you asked about, you know, what do the apparition bosses give you?

484
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:41,000
They're, aside from the loot and all that stuff, they're also your first source of your first 10 boss powers that make up the magic tier,

485
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
as you can kind of see in this little chart here.

486
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Graduating from the apparition bosses, you now go into the world bosses.

487
01:09:50,000 --> 01:10:00,000
So each one of our three world bosses have a power associated with them, and then so too do each of our lair bosses capped off with Lilith with her own boss power that you can acquire.

488
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
It's like a ladder in the boss power.

489
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah, it's definitely celebrating the progression journey of bosses from, you know, the moment you log in to the moment that you're powerful enough to take down Lilith.

490
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah.

491
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Bilal, you know, Bilal being kind of like the star of the season, he's special, he gets two powers, because that's just how he rolls.

492
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Yeah, cheating.

493
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Yeah, and I think, you know, one of the cool things about this kind of structure, it's a very structured power climb, so little ambiguity of like, how do I get the Wandering Deaths power?

494
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Well, go fight and kill him.

495
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:39,000
It's just that nice little structured journey that kind of is a nice little stamp collection just to reward each kind of a tier progression that you make across your, you know, leveling and endgame journeys.

496
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:45,000
But that's not just the coolest part of it, in my opinion here, is that it's also just how the powers work this season.

497
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
So you can see that we have four slots, the top slot and three little kind of like supporting slots.

498
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So the really cool thing is that each one of these powers have two sides to them that activate depending on which power slot you put them in.

499
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So you can have up to one main, one power, you can have up to one power slot into your main power slots, or you can have up to three power slot into your modifier slots.

500
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And I just want to dive into this Wandering Deaths chest beam example here.

501
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So if I were to slot the Wandering Deaths power into the main power slot, I would actually unlock the full representation of his iconic chest beam power.

502
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
So the main powers is activating and unlocking the actual iconic power that is representative of the boss.

503
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:39,000
We're going to show kind of a little bit of a showcase after this, but that's how that respective area of the power system works.

504
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
The modifier slots though are super, are cool and powerful in their own right though.

505
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:51,000
So let's say I don't necessarily need the Wandering Deaths, you know, main power for whatever utility purposes.

506
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I can still get value out of the fact that I own it by slotting it into the modifier slots, which activates kind of like the side B of it, which is more of a supporting thing.

507
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So in this case, it's your main power. Now it empowers your main power to instantly execute non-boss enemies, you know, when they're within a certain threshold of life.

508
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,000
So it's not just, you know, 24 ways to kind of express your sense of power this season.

509
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
It's 48 because each of these powers have, you know, kind of like two sides to them.

510
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Yeah, it's really like build your own boss power.

511
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Essentially, yeah. It's a lot of fun just kind of like mix-match slot around and see, you know, what kind of a concoction you come up with.

512
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And that's something that I'm particularly interested in going to the PTR is like, what are some of the favorite combinations or ideally, what are the favorite combinations based off of the circumstance that you're going into?

513
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Definitely. Oh, go ahead, Charles.

514
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:53,000
One thing I wanted to, that I'm really excited about the system is in previous seasonal power systems, we sometimes found as you got really high, you know, Paragon levels, your build is like super powerful.

515
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:59,000
The relative impact of some of the seasonal powers was a little lower. They didn't really scale with you as well as we really wanted to.

516
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:06,000
We've done an update in this season where these boss powers are going to scale with your Paragon level as you're leveling up.

517
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And so they actually are going to get more powerful as you get more powerful.

518
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Right. So the exact number that you, as soon as you unlock it, it, you know, maybe is not the most powerful thing, but as you're powering up, it's still going to be relevant to your build at every stage of your progression.

519
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:26,000
That's really good. I like the fact that the powers don't kind of just live on their own little island. Like they get in degrade into the other systems that we're engaging with.

520
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Yeah. So that's a high level of the, of the boss powers for season eight. And I want to toss it back to Ruben for just kind of a little bit of a live showcase of them.

521
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Hey, Derek. Thanks for all that. That was great, man. Yeah, I'm excited. What do you got for us?

522
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Well, I get the fun job of showcasing all these powers today, but I must confess, I got my smoothie. So I'm a little jacked up today.

523
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I'm so happy you got your smoothie. So happy for you. I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled.

524
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Let's go ahead and open up our inventory here. And you'll notice on the left side, a familiar tab is our seasonal tab, which is boss powers.

525
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:11,000
So from this tab is where you'll be kind of interacting with your powers throughout the season. Like Derek mentioned, you can drag and drop them, equip them on the fly.

526
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
There's no penalty. I think the team and everybody wants you to experiment and have fun with the builds.

527
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:24,000
You can also upgrade them by hovering over them. There's a corresponding button here on PC. It's F. So you go ahead and push that to upgrade them.

528
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And yeah, so the top slot is your main slot, like Derek mentioned. This is where your main powers go. And all the bottom ones are your modifier slots.

529
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:40,000
So right here, you know, Derek's favorite was the Wandering Death's chest beam. So as a modifier, right, you can execute enemies.

530
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:48,000
But as soon as you drag it over here, boom, now it's a channeled ability. And you'll notice right away, it's a prominent beam.

531
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Yeah, it works well with channeled abilities. It only works with channeled abilities, actually.

532
01:14:52,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And it's kind of cool with Densive Knives because you can adjust and do these micro adjustments to kind of maximize the effect on your target just to keep it on them a little bit longer.

533
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Yeah, and as you can kind of tell, we're not necessarily going for subtlety in terms of the expression of these powers this season.

534
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I'm dying. Someone in chat is like, Goku?

535
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Oh, my God.

536
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I got some wonders. We'll call it real quick. Just one thing I absolutely love is just the animations of the UI itself.

537
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And, you know, you slot these little like eyeball socket, eyeball powers into the little eye sockets and it blinks.

538
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And it just is kind of just fun across the board just engaging with this.

539
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Well, true.

540
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It is and it pops.

541
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Yeah.

542
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
So what do we got next?

543
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:39,000
The next one I want to showcase is Lilith's Wind of Hate just because probably most of us have died to this before.

544
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Her spike ability from the ground.

545
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And it works on almost every skill.

546
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So you can definitely you can see as soon as I dash here, I get the spikes with barrage.

547
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You get the spikes so you can slot in almost every build and have fun with it.

548
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Even dance of knives.

549
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Really cool ability there.

550
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Let's see what else we got.

551
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Another fun one.

552
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
There's a transformative ability is Joriel's Burrow.

553
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
So it completely changes your evade skill and you burrow underground.

554
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
You deal damage when you go in to the ground and when you exit.

555
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,000
But the real cool thing is you become immune while underground and you can control the direction.

556
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Oh, that's awesome.

557
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
It is awesome.

558
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Yeah, that's one of my absolute favorite.

559
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I love that one.

560
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You can stand still if you like or whatever.

561
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And it scales as you get more evade charges, you get more burrows.

562
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So I'm sure there's a lot of especially adding three new bosses with all kinds of crazy effects.

563
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
You know, you can now dodge them a little bit easier, which is great.

564
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I'm sure there's some good use cases for that.

565
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Yeah.

566
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Even just right there, I want to just chime in and just say that, you know, we showed off a power that procs off of the evade.

567
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
We showed one that procs off channeling and one that procs off any skills.

568
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Like one of the goals going into the design of these powers was to just remove any ambiguity about how do I actually proc it.

569
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:58,000
We wanted to make it as utility focused and straightforward as possible so that players can really easily digest and how they work it into their builds.

570
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Yeah, that's a great point.

571
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Urvar's Bombs is probably my personal favorite as I like making builds and interesting builds.

572
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
This definitely supports ultimate builds.

573
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And as you can see on the screen here, it lowers your cooldown by five seconds, which is great, and gives you a nice damage component to kind of top off on it.

574
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
So we're playing Rogue and Death Trap is an ultimate ability.

575
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So as soon as I pop it, you'll see Urvar's Bombs kind of shoot out and you get that lower cooldown effect as well.

576
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
So it's great.

577
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And you get two Death Traps.

578
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I wonder how you got that.

579
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I wonder how you got that.

580
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
That's on me.

581
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That's on me, guys.

582
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yeah.

583
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
All the teasing on the stream.

584
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And finally, before they play the walk-off music, I think I could showcase, let's do Gregor's Lightning Square.

585
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
So if you noticed, Lilith's skill had like a slight cooldown.

586
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
This one scales with your build really well.

587
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,000
So the more you can cast core skills, the more you get these iconic kind of lightning strike panels shoot out from your character.

588
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So you can imagine you can just go full Thunder God here the whole time with your builds.

589
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
So yeah, I think that's all I can showcase today.

590
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
But I appreciate the time.

591
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
No, thank you.

592
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
That was awesome.

593
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Yeah, so again, those are just like a kind of a sneak peek at just a handful of the powers.

594
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Again, throughout the course of the PTR, you'll get to, you know, experiment and engage with all of them.

595
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And again, looking forward to the feedback and just, you know, just general notes of how you incorporate into your builds and what really excites you.

596
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So I think that's pretty much the wrap up for all the content coming in Season 8 that persists beyond and within.

597
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Yeah, all the Season 8 stuff that will be available in PTR for players to actually jump into.

598
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:40,000
We're still going to be talking about a few more things as we get closer to Season 8 with the launch of the actual season itself.

599
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So Derek, thank you so much for walking us through everything.

600
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And of course, with a new Season and a new PTR, we have a lot of changes that are coming into classes, specifically like the Rogue.

601
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
We saw someone doing those, yeah.

602
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
We can just skip the Rogue.

603
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
We'll just skip the Rogue.

604
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
We'll just skip the Rogue.

605
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
There's other classes to talk about.

606
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Yeah, so Charles over here is actually going to go through all the class changes that players will be able to experience and test out during the PTR.

607
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Yeah, of course. I mean, there's tons of new bosses to fight, so how are you going to fight them?

608
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Right, so let's talk about some class updates that are coming.

609
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
First, I want to talk about some updates that are going to affect all classes in some way.

610
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
These are kind of a bit more generic updates.

611
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So talking about ultimate scaling, this is something that we introduced in Season 7, the current live season,

612
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:30,000
where as you get to rank 5 of the ultimate skills, some of them had mechanics that allowed you to crank up their damage by building different stats.

613
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Right, so if you got more damage while fortified, then your blood wave is going to do more damage, for instance.

614
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
We think that's really cool. It enabled a lot of very powerful builds.

615
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
A lot of very powerful builds.

616
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And so we're looking at ensuring that those don't like really eclipse every other option in the game.

617
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
We still love that those are powerful builds. We love that you're playing them.

618
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
We don't want them to be the only option.

619
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And so with that in mind, we're looking at putting a cap on that scaling.

620
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
You can scale them up to 200% bonus damage, which is still a lot.

621
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
You're still doing, you know, like triple damage.

622
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:14,000
But we just want to make sure it doesn't get completely out of control with all the new stats and some of the scaling coming in from some of the seasonal powers that could potentially lead those to be, you know, crowding out other options of gameplay.

623
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Additionally, we're looking at crowd control.

624
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:25,000
This is something I talked about on our last campfire chat about how we're really looking at the moment to moment combat of our game.

625
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
You know, like, what are you doing like every like one second to the next?

626
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And one thing that came up a lot was sometimes enemies just randomly get crowd controlled.

627
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
They randomly are frozen or stunned.

628
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And you a lot of this comes from some of the what we call incidental crowd control as in lucky hit crowd control effects or anything that involves not like, oh, I pressed a button.

629
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Now they're stunned, right?

630
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And we noticed like, hey, we got a lot of these effects across the game in many different places.

631
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And so we looked at really toning those down specifically in the generic spaces.

632
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I know Fist of Fate is one of a very popular unique item right now for many reasons.

633
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
One of them was that kind of free crowd control.

634
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
But that's something that we think wasn't really promoting the best moment to moment combat and most engaging flow.

635
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So that particular affix has been changed to lucky hit apply vulnerable.

636
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But a lot of the other identity of Fist of Fate is still there as well.

637
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So it still has, you know, wide ranges on things.

638
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It still does random damage and a lot of lucky hit chance as well.

639
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Yeah. And this change really puts the value of Frost Nova and Ground Stomp and it sort of makes those more valuable and satisfying.

640
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Right. Yeah.

641
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So if you really want to get those kind of crowd control effects, like, it's going to be a build choice.

642
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
You're going to have to consciously do it and you're going to like know when it's happening.

643
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
It's not just, oh, they randomly got stunned.

644
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
And, you know, if they didn't get stunned, maybe you got hit.

645
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And that never felt good when it was just kind of purely random.

646
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Yeah. Yeah.

647
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Additionally, this is something that the keen-eyed among you might have spied when we were looking at some other stuff.

648
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
We've done a bit of a naming pass on some of the damage over time effects.

649
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
This is no functional change.

650
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
This is just a naming thing where we have things like physical damage.

651
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
And when it's physical damage over time, we call it bleeding.

652
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And when it's poison, we call it poisoning, for instance.

653
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
We didn't previously have names for shadow, lightning, or cold damage over time.

654
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,000
We would just call it like from shadow damage over time affected enemies, which was an absolute mouthful.

655
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
So we've got new common terms.

656
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Shadow damage over time will be called corrupting damage.

657
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Lightning damage over time is shocking damage.

658
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And cold damage over time, which we saw with the wandering death chest beam, is called frostbite damage.

659
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
So that's just a terminology thing.

660
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
It still relates to those base damage types, same as always.

661
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
It's just a terminology update.

662
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Cleans up the tooltips.

663
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Absolutely, yeah.

664
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Alright, so let's get on to some of the actual class updates.

665
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Starting, oh, we'll just go alphabetically with the Barbarian.

666
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Alright, so our focus on Barbarian this season is primarily about Barbarian's core fantasy of being physical and hitting enemies with a big weapon, right?

667
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:10,000
In the past couple seasons, a lot of the meta builds around Barbarian have focused around things like earthquakes or dusting.

668
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And they're also focused around the boss devils, which are really cool and fun.

669
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:19,000
But I think they, we got some feedback that, hey, I don't really feel like I'm hitting enemies with my big weapon.

670
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I'm just making a tornado that hits them.

671
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Which is not maybe fulfilling the fantasy that you want out of a Barbarian.

672
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Your core skill isn't the cool thing. It's the thing that the core skill spawns.

673
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Right.

674
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Yeah.

675
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Right. And that's, it's cool that those exist, but we want to make sure we're also catering to that, you know, heavy hitter kind of fantasy.

676
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And so a lot of the updates this season are focused around that.

677
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Specifically updates to double swing core skill and the twin strikes unique to make that a bit more impactful to actually be hitting.

678
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Whirlwind as well.

679
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:58,000
That's getting a buff and a rework with Gore's, its unique Gore's devastating grips.

680
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Um, and then the new unique and legendary this season really talked to mighty throw in particular and make that just like the biggest hitting thing.

681
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Let's take a look at those, uh, uniques and, or the unique and legendary here.

682
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
So we've got the Bane of Aja Den.

683
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
This is a, uh, unique glove item.

684
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
And it says that every 12 seconds your next mighty throw is going to detonate all of its pulses instantly.

685
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
You know, normally mighty throw like pulses over time.

686
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's going to do them all at once and deal massively increased damage.

687
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And that's going to pair up very well with the new legendary aspect of delayed extinction,

688
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:39,000
which causes both mighty throw and steel grasp to gain multiplicative bonus damage rather than cooldown from cooldown reduction.

689
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
So if you've got cooldown reduction on your gear or on the Bane of Aja Den, for instance,

690
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
that's not going to actually reduce the cooldown.

691
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It's going to be a multiplicative scaler for these skills.

692
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And so that now you've got a new problem to solve, right?

693
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
You, you, uh, can't cast these skills quite as often, but when you do, they're going to hit super hard.

694
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
And so we've got a video clip of it just deleting a screen.

695
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So you walk up to a ground here and they're all gone.

696
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
One hit, that's all it takes.

697
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Because you've got all these multipliers on your one big hit.

698
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
But of course, because it doesn't benefit from cooldown reduction,

699
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
that cooldown is going to be pretty much locked at that 12 second mark.

700
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And so you're going to have to find some other way to kind of fill the gap in there.

701
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And you've got a new challenge for your build to overcome.

702
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I'm hoping to see, like, Belial get decked by the...

703
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I think it is possible that you're going to melt some bosses with some really big hits.

704
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
It's a great finishing move.

705
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Oh, yeah.

706
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
All right, let's take a look at the Druid.

707
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
So for the Druid, I want to talk a little bit about...

708
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
One of the meta builds right now is revolts around Cataclysm.

709
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And kind of snapshotting issues that come up with that.

710
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And so for those of you who don't know what snapshotting basically means is...

711
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
For Cataclysm, which is one of their ultimate skills that has a duration.

712
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,000
So you press the button, it summons a storm around you that lasts for some amount of time.

713
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
And if you get a lot of that cooldown reduction and you can cast Cataclysm a second time

714
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:08,000
before the first one expires, currently on the live game, the second cast of Cataclysm

715
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:15,000
will keep all of the bonuses and, like, bonus damage effects or guaranteed overpowers or whatever

716
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
that was affecting the first one.

717
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And that was definitely not intended.

718
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
That is not how we wanted that to work.

719
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:27,000
We didn't want bonuses from one cast kind of instance to carry over to the next cast.

720
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Now this can only happen in situations where you get that lot of cooldown.

721
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
But it was kind of promoting this gameplay where it's very feast or famine.

722
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
If you successfully kind of snapshot all the buffs, this build is insanely powerful.

723
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And if you mess it up or you don't get the snapshot quite right, you're actually really weak.

724
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And that led to unintuitive gameplay and this really big divide between the best and the optimal

725
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
and, like, kind of the average normal case scenario.

726
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:03,000
So we're addressing that where we don't really want to promote that between two different cast snapshotting.

727
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Yeah, we don't like snapshotting in general.

728
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Right, yeah.

729
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:12,000
The kind of snapshotting where you are persisting things between different cast instances

730
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
or equipping gear and then unequipping it to maintain a bonus.

731
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Those are snapshotting things that we don't think promotes healthy gameplay.

732
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
It's unintuitive in a lot of cases.

733
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
You need to read a guide and follow an exact checklist to do it.

734
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
That's not something that we think is good for the game.

735
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:37,000
There are some cases where, you know, with Cataclysm, you know, giving the bonus to that whole cast,

736
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:43,000
that first time you cast it, that it, you might say it's kind of snapshots for the duration of Cataclysm,

737
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
but that's intended where it says your next cast does something.

738
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:54,000
That's what we want, but we don't want that to persist on to multiple casts or through basically infinitely.

739
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
So that's one thing that we're adjusting on Druid.

740
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
But we're also looking at promoting other play styles as well.

741
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
We think that build is fun, but there's other ways to play Druid as well.

742
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Specifically with Stoneburst, that's the Earth Core skill.

743
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:16,000
It was kind of a channeled skill, which from a lot of our channeled skills, they are not allowed to overpower.

744
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:25,000
But with Stoneburst particularly, we have reworked one of its legendary items to allow it to overpower when you detonate it at maximum size,

745
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
which is really cool and opens up some new build possibilities for Stoneburst.

746
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And finally, I want to talk about the new unique Gathlin's Birthright.

747
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
This is a, let's take a look at it on screen here.

748
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:43,000
It's in a similar vein to Tempest Roar and Vassilius Prayer, where it is a unique helm that is very transformational.

749
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,000
But rather than talking to werewolves or werebear build, it's talking to human form builds.

750
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,000
If you just, you don't want to, you don't want to embrace the wilds quite as much, you want to stay in your human form,

751
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Gathlin's Birthright is going to be the unique helm for you.

752
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:03,000
It says, while you're in human form, critically striking enemies with your nature magic skills will grant you Anima of the Forest for 10 seconds.

753
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And when you get, whenever you gain Anima of the Forest, you are infused with bonus key passives, Perfect Storm and Earthen Might.

754
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:17,000
So if you have this and you have another key passive, you can potentially have up to three key passives active at once,

755
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
which is not something we've ever done before in Diablo 4.

756
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:28,000
That's nutty. And I love that it's on the helm. So if you really want to be a human druid, which historically, you know, hasn't been as great as like Werewolf, for example, this is the helm for you.

757
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yeah, this is exactly, exactly that. It's in a similar spot as like, hey, this is build defining in the way that Tempest Roar is for werewolves.

758
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,000
We want this to be the build defining helm for human form druids.

759
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Additionally, Aspect of Impending Deluge that empowers your Storm Strike, which is probably pretty useful with this human form nature magic build,

760
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:53,000
which will cause your Storm Strike to deal more and also increase damage that they take from your other skills for a time.

761
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I think we've got a picture of this or a video of this in action where you've got your druid, it's got your, you need 200 stacks of Anima of the Force,

762
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:08,000
which sounds like a lot, but it triggers on every hit. So in most combat situations, you actually stack it up pretty quick.

763
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:15,000
And see, once you get this online, you're going to be empowered with Earthen Might and with Perfect Storm and with Nature's Fury.

764
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
You have all of this power.

765
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,000
And the idea of three passes going at once is, the key passes is crazy.

766
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Yeah.

767
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
And the boss power is slapped on top of that too.

768
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Oh yeah. It is a lot when you get this empowered state.

769
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Alright, moving on to one of my favorite classes, the Necromancer.

770
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
So Necromancer was probably the talk of the current season, season 7, with Bloodwave.

771
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I know we've mentioned it a few times on stream. Bloodwave, really good.

772
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:51,000
We've talked about how we're going to look at ultimate scaling, so maybe it won't scale up with the bonus damage,

773
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
at least not to the same level that it had before. We're going to put a cap on that.

774
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,000
We also just think we generally overshot the mark on the unique item, the Kissimmee's Legacy,

775
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
which really, like, you get this item and suddenly you're a god.

776
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:13,000
We just had so much power in one spot. And we like a bit more of that progression that Colin was alluding to before about that zero to hero journey.

777
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:19,000
And when you have one item that is, you equip it and it's over. Like, you're as powerful as you ever need to be.

778
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That really shortcuts that journey and really makes it feel less satisfying than we want.

779
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:31,000
So we're taking a look at reducing the power of that unique in particular, as well as some other adjustments to Bloodwave.

780
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:37,000
We do want Bloodwave builds to still be powerful and still be an option if you like that playstyle.

781
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
We just don't want it to be the S++ tier that it was in the past.

782
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Additionally, we're taking a look at Bloodlance. This is a core skill that has historically been very good in multi-target,

783
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:56,000
kind of clearing out pit runs or dungeon situations. But then you run up into a boss, which, hey, we're fighting a lot of bosses this season.

784
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Yeah, we'll be.

785
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And it suddenly falls really flat because its core mechanic is about, like, arcing damage between enemies.

786
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And if there's only one enemy, what are you doing here, right?

787
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:13,000
So with this update to Bloodlance, it's going to still maintain some of that fantasy where it arcs the damage between enemies.

788
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
But if you're hitting a target who's already lanced, it's going to do a massive amount more damage.

789
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
So it's much better in single-target situations and much more viable for bossing.

790
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And finally, the new legendary and unique for this season talks to minions.

791
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,000
So let's take a look at Sanguivar, Blade of Zir, the unique two-handed sword.

792
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So this weapon will empower your summons, so your minions and your army of the dead, to affect enemies with Vampiric Curse.

793
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Now, for those of you who played back in Season 2, Vampiric Curse was a mechanic that we introduced in Season of Blood

794
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
where you affect enemies with it, and as you kill them, you kind of collect their soul.

795
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:57,000
And then you can unleash these souls. They kind of run out from you and explode in this really satisfying moment.

796
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:04,000
And we put that on a handful of legendary aspects, but now all of your summons will affect enemies with Vampiric Curse.

797
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
And you can unleash them with Army of the Dead.

798
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And when you do that, the souls from Vampiric Curse and Army of the Dead itself will deal massively increased damage, scaling with how many souls you've collected.

799
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
It's huge. I love Minion Necro. It's like my favorite one.

800
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Oh yeah. Yeah. This is really cool for Army of the Dead and Minion Necro to just really be that impactful moment of summoning an army of skeletons to just eviscerate the enemies.

801
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And additionally, Aspect of Service and Sacrifice, I love playing with this one. This one feels so good to play.

802
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Your skeleton warriors explode on death, dealing a massive chunk of physical damage to surrounding enemies.

803
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:51,000
And to help make sure they die, they lose 25% life per second while in combat.

804
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:58,000
So you're going to be needing to resummon them quite often, but when you do, hey, it's good, because they're going to be detonating for this massive chunk at the end.

805
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,000
And additionally, while you're resummoning all your warriors, your mages are going to be super tanky.

806
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
They're going to take 90% less damage and deal massively increased damage.

807
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:15,000
So you're going to have your mages up pretty much all the time, and you're going to be focusing on resummoning the warriors to run in there and explode and do their damage that way.

808
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:22,000
That's awesome. It's a really clever way to make it feel like you're constantly summoning and you have your back line of mages just obliterating.

809
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Yeah, it's great. Let's take a look at Sanguevar, Blade of Xeer in action here.

810
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Oh no, sorry, this is actually service and sacrifice.

811
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
So you've got your skeleton warriors, the skirmishers, they run up there.

812
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
And then here's Blade of Xeer, right?

813
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
You get all those skeleton warriors running out when you activate Army of the Dead.

814
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,000
You just get the normal ones that are running around, but then they all...

815
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:53,000
You unleash a stream of them straight from you with the Sanguevar.

816
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Really impactful ultimate skill there.

817
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Yeah, Army of the Dead is just so underutilized, so I'm so happy to see it come back into the fold.

818
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
It's great.

819
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Alright, next up we've got the one we've been teasing for a bit.

820
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Thank you, Ruben.

821
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
The Rogue.

822
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Let's take a look at the idea with Rogue.

823
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
So, as you probably guessed, the theme of Rogue this season is looking at trap builds.

824
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Right? With both death trap and poison trap in a way.

825
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Historically, poison trap has been kind of underrepresented.

826
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Death trap builds have been quite popular, pretty powerful, and a lot of fun to play.

827
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Poison trap kind of fell by the wayside a little bit.

828
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It had a number of issues that we're looking to address this season to really promote poison trap as a viable standalone build.

829
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,000
And what we're seeing from Ruben was the Scoundrel's Leather rework.

830
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Now, this is a unique chest item that's been in the game for a while.

831
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It was about traps in the past.

832
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:55,000
We've done a rework this season where when you cast a trap, or rather every 10 seconds when you cast the trap,

833
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
you're going to get a bonus death trap.

834
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:03,000
So, you could cast poison trap, or caltrops, or death trap itself, and then you get a second death trap.

835
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:11,000
And when you actually cast the death trap active button, you're going to kind of jump or teleport to that position.

836
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
So, you can just instantly get into the fray there.

837
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Oh, that's cool.

838
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Yeah, so, you know, Rogues are all about mobility and jumping around the battlefield and doing that kind of thing.

839
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
This is just another tool in their arsenal to really jump in, put the death trap down, which groups up some enemies,

840
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
and then they're ready for you to slaughter there.

841
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,000
But let's take a look at the new items that talk to poison trap specifically.

842
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:41,000
The bands of Icarus Rose, these are unique gloves that says your poison trap, which normally has a 9 second duration,

843
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
it's always going to do its full damage over 3 seconds instead.

844
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
So, it's much shorter duration, but higher DPS.

845
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And it's always going to benefit from all of its upgrades.

846
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
You know, that enhancement and those modifications, you just get all of them.

847
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
You don't need to put skill points in.

848
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And normally, the two choices are mutually exclusive.

849
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
You get both with these.

850
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
And they're going to be even more powerful.

851
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Additionally, poison trap will now also benefit from your combo points if you're using those.

852
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
It's going to have no cooldown during the inner sight if you're using inner sight.

853
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
And if you're using preparation, its cooldown is going to be reduced by the preparation trigger.

854
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
So previously, poison trap didn't really interact with any of these three mechanics very well.

855
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
And now, it benefits from whichever one you want.

856
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
That's so cool.

857
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
So it really makes it more like a core skill, something that can work into my rotation.

858
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Oh yeah.

859
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Yeah, you're going to be wanting to use this very often with this unique.

860
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
And then, the aspect of contamination.

861
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,000
As many builds that focus around poison on Rogue often want to build critical strike damage,

862
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
because that's really good with the poison imbuement,

863
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
poison trap now also can scale up with some critical strike chance.

864
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
So with aspect of contamination, it unleashes a poison burst when it detonates,

865
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
like kind of an initial upfront hit.

866
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,000
And then, if that burst critically strikes, which, you know, if you build in a lot of crit chance, it probably will,

867
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
or if you hit a lot of enemies, then you're going to deal increased poison damage for a duration.

868
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Which will, of course, increase the rest of the duration of the poison trap.

869
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
And this is probably my favorite clip here. Let's get a clip of this one.

870
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Right? So you apply poison trap, which it's going to throw two of them out, and one of its upgrades knocks down enemies,

871
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and because it's increased, it knocks them down for quite a while, and so they just take a little nap in your poison traps.

872
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I don't recommend it, but hey, if they do, they take a ton of poison damage.

873
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I love the knockdown animation of this guy.

874
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Yeah. So good.

875
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
This guy just falls right down.

876
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Just sit down.

877
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Lay down, I guess.

878
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
His face is in it too.

879
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
His face plants and then succumbs to the poison.

880
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It's awesome.

881
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
All right. Moving on, we've got our Sorceress.

882
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:02,000
So the Sorceress class definitely is one of the ones currently on Season 7 that I think didn't have any of these real big outlier builds

883
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:12,000
that we had kind of talked about. Some of the highest highs come from like the Blood Necro or the Druid with the snapshotting Cataclysm.

884
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And I think I definitely want to acknowledge that, you know, Sorceress maybe didn't have some of those real outliers this season,

885
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
and they were maybe felt like they were a bit behind of those.

886
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So as we talked about with other classes, we're definitely looking at bringing those outlier builds down a notch

887
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:34,000
to bring them kind of back to the norm of some of the other builds so they're not so far ahead.

888
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:43,000
But for Sorceress, we're looking at improving some of the quality of life and some of the interactions between some of their mechanics,

889
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:49,000
like Crackling Energy, Meteors and Meteorites, and making sure they scale well with the build.

890
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Like Crackling Energy will now have the Shock skill tag, so if you're building up damage for Shock skills or some of the other synergies there,

891
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
those now interact with your Crackling Energy.

892
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:03,000
And additionally with Meteor and Meteorites, they're not going to be able to scale with each other's damage,

893
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:11,000
which helps builds just be a bit more cohesive and feel more robustly supported.

894
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:19,000
That being said, I think where Sorceress has been in Season 7 is in terms of its power progression

895
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:30,000
and the relative strength of its builds amongst each other is closer to the ideal state of where we envision all classes ending up.

896
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:36,000
We recognize that they are kind of a bit lower than other classes in Season 7,

897
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,000
but we're looking at bringing them up a little bit with improved quality of life and build options

898
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:47,000
and making sure that some of the outlier builds that's really skewing that perception are being brought to be...

899
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
to...

900
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Bring them close together and create some more harmony between the classes.

901
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Exactly.

902
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Yeah.

903
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Yeah, and I think this is something that we're actively looking at again to the point of early in the season.

904
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:03,000
If things aren't really performing to the level of our expectation and it doesn't feel good,

905
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
then those are things that we're going to buff and Sorceress is a great example of what we're going to be really looking at.

906
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Yeah.

907
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Yeah, and we want to do that in ways that make...

908
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
We don't just want to slap on a 50x scaler on Sorceress.

909
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,000
We want to make sure that the builds feel cohesive and coherent in a way that makes a lot of sense.

910
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
And so that's what all the bulk of our focus is for Sorc this season.

911
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Specifically, I want to talk a little bit about Ice Shards.

912
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
That's what the new Unique is going to be working with here.

913
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Let's take a look at the Unique, the Hail of Virglass.

914
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:44,000
This is a Unique Helm that's going to empower your Ice Shards to spread out rather than shoot in kind of a straight line, that kind of rapid fire.

915
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
It's now going to be a spread pattern.

916
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:55,000
You can hit more enemies with it and you get bonus shards and you're going to be dealing increased damage for every time an Ice Shard's damage is an enemy and it's going to stack up.

917
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
So it takes a lot of stacks.

918
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
You need to be spamming Ice Shards.

919
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
You need to be hitting a lot.

920
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
But once you do, it unleashes a lot of bonus damage.

921
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
And also, it just makes the skill, in my opinion, a lot more usable.

922
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I like the spread pattern a whole lot.

923
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,000
It lets you hit wider screen and you can kind of like shotgun enemies if you get nice and close to them.

924
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
That's cool.

925
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And Shivering Aspect, a new Legendary Aspect here.

926
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Enemies are going to take increased damage based on how much they're chilled or staggering.

927
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Now, historically, some of the Frost Sorcs or some of the other builds that were heavy on those crowd control effects,

928
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,000
sometimes they really struggled into bosses, which, hey, bosses are the theme of the season.

929
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
It's very appropriate.

930
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:43,000
So we're making sure that some of these new effects that scale based on the crowd control effects also work against bosses.

931
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So this will kind of take how much stagger you've built up on the boss and also give you a bonus damage based on that.

932
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,000
So we're really being cognizant of, hey, let's make sure this works in the situations you want it to.

933
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And it's not night and day, oh, I'm clearing trash mobs and then I hit the boss and you just feel so different.

934
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
We want to make sure that's a bit smoother of an experience between the two ways of playing.

935
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Alright, let's take a look at the Hail of Virglass with these new Ice Shards in action.

936
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Right, so they fire out pretty quick, they fire out in a nice spread, and you can clear through whole packs of skeletons with a single cast here.

937
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Multi-shot.

938
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Oh yeah.

939
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Multi-shot with Ice Shards.

940
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Oh yeah.

941
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Alright, and moving on to our final class here, the Spiritborn.

942
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:35,000
So the Spiritborn was in a pretty good state, I mean, similar to Sorceress where it didn't have those crazy overpowered builds.

943
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:46,000
But we think it's in a relatively healthy spot and we're just looking at empowering new build options and making tighter synergies between the builds and giving you some new tools to play with.

944
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:58,000
With that in mind, we took a look at Rushing Claw. It's one of my favorite skills on the Spiritborn, but never really found its way into any of the most popular builds in the past couple seasons since Spiritborn was released.

945
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,000
And we've updated the two upgrade choices to be kind of transformative.

946
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:13,000
It's kind of a, if you pick one upgrade, the current one, Rushing Claws has four charges, and so when you use a charge you kind of quickly dash through an enemy.

947
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
And so you have four charges, you can spam it four times real quick.

948
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:24,000
The other upgrade now has been reworked where it gains even more charges. It gains 12 charges.

949
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:36,000
But using it consumes all the charges. So really it has just one, but for every charge that it consumes it deals massively increased damage and it hits a wider area.

950
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:42,000
So now gaining cooldown reduction or gaining more charges actually just increases your damage output.

951
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And it promotes a very different play style for this. So you get kind of an option. You can choose the original version, which is still very powerful and very cool.

952
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Or you can choose the new upgrade and kind of spend all your charges at once, do a big kind of damage cooldown, and then work on building up those charges again to deal even more.

953
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Additionally, we've looked at Storm Feathers and specifically how they interact with the new unique item, the Sunbird's Gorgett, which I think we've got a picture of right here.

954
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So the Sunbird's Gorgett is a new unique amulet. This really works to synergize with the Eagle and Jaguar builds.

955
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:27,000
So it says picking up a Storm Feather, which you can create in many different ways, will form a Firestorm around you for eight seconds that deals fire damage.

956
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:37,000
And every additional Storm Feather that you pick up is going to intensify this Firestorm. It's going to make it grow in size up to a maximum, and then it's going to increase its damage output.

957
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
For as many Storm Feathers as you can spawn, this Firestorm is going to get more intense.

958
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:48,000
But it only lasts for eight seconds, so intensifying it or picking up more Storm Feathers, it's not going to extend the duration.

959
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:57,000
So it's kind of locked to that eight second duration, and then it'll reset. So you really want to collect as many Storm Feathers as possible in eight seconds, and then it restarts.

960
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:03,000
And also this Firestorm is considered an Eagle, Jaguar, and Storm Feather skill.

961
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:09,000
So you've got lots of options for how you want to increase this damage through your other talent choices or your itemization.

962
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:15,000
You've got lots of options for how to work this into a build in either Eagle or Jaguar or both.

963
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And following up on the theme with Rushing Claw, we've got the new Rip and Tear aspect, where Rushing Claw is going to deal increased damage, and is empowered based on how many charges you had when you cast it.

964
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:33,000
So if you're taking the upgrade that gives you 12 charges, it's probably always going to be with 4+, and so it's going to strike an additional time.

965
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:38,000
But if you're choosing the option where you spend each charge as you go, it's going to go through a bit of a cycle here.

966
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:48,000
You're going to get an additional Strike, then it's going to get a guaranteed Crit, then it's going to get a guaranteed Overpower, and when you just have one charge left, it's going to give you a nice chunky heal to help keep you in the fight.

967
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Nice. There's a ton of versatility in there.

968
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Yeah, yeah. Lots of different ways to play, and it works great with either way that Rushing Claw now works.

969
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Alright, let's take a look at the Sunbird's Gorget in action here, right? So you're moving along, you're picking up tons of these feathers, and the Firestorm around you just grows in intensity.

970
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:23,000
You've got lots of different ways to scale it up, and it provides a nice kind of passive AoE around you as you're picking them up, and you're really going to want to make sure you're kind of thinking about exactly how your character's moving to make sure you're picking up as many of these Storm Feathers as possible to maximize your damage output.

971
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Alright, that's a lot. We got a lot of new class content coming for every class. We did get through all of them.

972
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:46,000
But yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing all the new builds that these empower, how they modify old existing builds, and all the interesting combinations that I'm sure all of you will test out on the PTR and find out the most absolutely broken thing and let me know about it.

973
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Yes, please let us know if you find something absolutely broken, which I'm sure you will.

974
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
So thank you again, Charles, for walking us through all the different class changes.

975
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Again, this is, we do plan on having patch notes along with the blog related to everything tied to PTR.

976
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
So there's other changes that we didn't actually cover often here.

977
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:10,000
That will be on the Diablo4.com immediately after the stream.

978
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:16,000
So everyone can actually check it out, inspect it, you know, do their theory crafting and everything related to that.

979
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Of course, with PTR, we kind of want to know when PTR actually begins.

980
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
PTR is starting next Tuesday.

981
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
And this is, of course, PTR on PC Battle.net.

982
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:30,000
So players will be able to jump in starting on the 11th and it'll run for a week there.

983
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I will note that players actually will be able to also pre-download the PTR the day prior.

984
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:43,000
So around Monday afternoon here in California, translate that using some sort of time tool.

985
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
That will be when players will be able to pre-download.

986
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
So it'll be about a day beforehand.

987
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:57,000
One thing to note is, of course, the boost vendor, MRAC, will be available, which will be dancing in town for everyone.

988
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:05,000
But one thing we did want to note is that the boost themselves will be available probably two days after the PTR actually begins.

989
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,000
The reason behind this is actually a little bit tied to how Season 7 performed.

990
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:15,000
One thing we allowed players to do was immediately boost the second they got into PTR.

991
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
And we really didn't get that whole entire flow as we were kind of going through.

992
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Yeah, the headhunt and things like that.

993
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
So we also just want to hear your feedback on the leveling process, right?

994
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
This is why we run the PTR.

995
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:32,000
We really want to hear your thoughts on how the sort of more uniform leveling feels, how the legendary drop rates feel.

996
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:38,000
So that is really valuable to us for launching a really awesome Season 8 Return of the Wild.

997
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Yeah, and so after a couple days, MRAC will be more than happy to take your Paragon levels to insane numbers.

998
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
So PTR boost will be available just a couple days after that.

999
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:55,000
One other thing I do want to note is we will of course have our forums available and online for PTR.

1000
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
That is the best place to actually provide feedback.

1001
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Of course we do look in other places such as Reddit, Discord, etc.

1002
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:06,000
But I will say like the forums is kind of we turn them on specifically like a PTR section.

1003
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:13,000
So please put feedback in there because we are constantly checking in there for any notes, feedback from players on that end.

1004
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:16,000
One other note is within the PTR.

1005
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:24,000
You guys may see a term called the Reliquary that may just kind of pop up here and there and we haven't talked about the Reliquary.

1006
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Nor will the blog later today actually be talking about the Reliquary.

1007
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I will say that you guys will hear more about the Reliquary before the start of Season 8 in itself.

1008
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
But for right now, ignore it.

1009
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Turn a blind eye. I don't know.

1010
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,000
But it is a rework of our Battle Pass system that we're doing.

1011
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:51,000
We've heard a lot of comments from players related to the Battle Pass.

1012
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:55,000
We're trying to make it a little bit more customizable for people, especially for rewards that they're looking for.

1013
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
So we'll have a detailed breakdown of what the Reliquary is before Season 8.

1014
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,000
So looking forward to kind of sharing that before we actually kick off this season.

1015
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
And I know I have a lot.

1016
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I'm trying to get through all my stuff.

1017
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I'm hungry.

1018
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:17,000
The last thing we do want to talk about is I've gotten asked a million times about this and I've even seen it in chat.

1019
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
And it's related to a roadmap for Diablo 4.

1020
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:36,000
And I will say that we are actively working on a roadmap that we can share with you all, which is great because it gives you and everyone an opportunity to kind of see more of like the future vision of what's coming for Diablo 4.

1021
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
We do plan on actually having this roadmap out before Season 8.

1022
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
So we're really excited to share it.

1023
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,000
So as soon as we actually do have that available, we of course, you'll hear it everywhere.

1024
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:53,000
We will be on every single microphone and megaphone out there showcasing what the roadmap is.

1025
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
And you've probably seen roadmap.

1026
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
If you're curious, like what does a roadmap entail?

1027
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,000
You've probably seen some of our fellow teams here at Blizzard, such as like Diablo Immortal or like World of Warcraft.

1028
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
They've actually posted these more public facing roadmaps.

1029
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:15,000
And that's something that we want to do here so that you guys have that ability of being able to see what's coming up for Diablo 4 and more exciting news related to it.

1030
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
So I know we have Q&A.

1031
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
We want to jump into Q&A here really quickly.

1032
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:28,000
So if you guys do have any questions or anything, of course, we have our chat available on the Twitch link for Diablo.

1033
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
So feel free to jump in and ask any questions.

1034
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I know we always queue it up with one question specifically.

1035
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
And do we have a question slide here?

1036
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
There we go.

1037
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
How does party play work with lair bosses?

1038
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
We kind of covered this a little bit, but I don't know if you guys want to go into specifically more details on this.

1039
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Yeah, I can jump into that.

1040
01:52:46,000 --> 01:53:00,000
So when you are fighting the lair bosses in a party and the horde spawns, when you open the horde, we essentially do a bonus chance for an extra drop based on the amount of party play.

1041
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,000
So if you're in a party of four and you open up that horde, it's going to guarantee an extra unique item.

1042
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:12,000
So it scales with the amount of parties or party members you have and it's always a good time, you know, when you get together with people.

1043
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Awesome.

1044
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I'm like, I'm so unprepared.

1045
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
All right, let me look through the questions here as people are dropping in questions.

1046
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I have a team of people dropping questions to it.

1047
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,000
If you ever want to know how we do this, we just have a Google Doc and we're copying and pasting questions from chat into there.

1048
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Very high tech.

1049
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Very high tech, like super high tech.

1050
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Let's see.

1051
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
This is from Skulm TV.

1052
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Any plans to place a blacksmith or vendor near the boss rooms to help people quickly salvage slash clear inventory without having to go into town?

1053
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I think this is something that we can definitely take away and consider, especially with the revamp flow.

1054
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
That's definitely something that's interesting.

1055
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:56,000
One thing that the revamp flow does, I will touch on, is the amount of chain bossing really requires you to have a lot of power.

1056
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:07,000
If anything, you know, sort of some philosophy here is that we've heard a lot of feedback that it feels mandatory to play some of these bosses in a party just because chain bossing is so lucrative.

1057
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:14,000
And we do expect some amount of the chain bossing to come down a little bit because a lot more of the resources are being consumed when opening those chests.

1058
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
So it's not a direct answer to your question.

1059
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I think it's an interesting idea.

1060
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:29,000
But I do think the amount of chain bossing and required trips and flow breaks to go back to town from some of this bossing is going to come down a little bit, especially if you've been playing a ton of partying.

1061
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Awesome.

1062
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Question from Fan27.

1063
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Q&A, or sorry, he wrote Diablo Q&A and I just read that out loud.

1064
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Any chance we will have to redo strongholds and waypoints on every character every single season?

1065
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I can answer that one too.

1066
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Yeah, this is something I definitely experience.

1067
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:56,000
It's always a big pain in the ass where it's like, oh, there's some cool bounty or apparition incursion, but I have to go get the waypoint.

1068
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
It's something the team has been talking about.

1069
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:06,000
There's no concrete plans today, which I know is disappointing, but it's something we know is a problem and something we 100% want to tackle in the near future.

1070
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Awesome.

1071
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Jokems says, this is actually a question that we were talking about that might actually come up, but would you consider adding the frog from Witch Powers in Season 7 as a permanent companion skill for druids?

1072
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:33,000
And at the moment I can say we're not for that specifically, but it is a thing that I think we didn't really clarify in regards to what from Season 7 is kind of like for sure staying over.

1073
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I will say like the Witch Powers are most definitely like something that aren't carrying over completely over to the future seasons.

1074
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:49,000
But one thing in regards to at least the Tree of Whispers is that like we have a bunch of new NPCs there.

1075
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
We redid the layout there.

1076
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:57,000
That is made that as a hub that doesn't feel like I'm just going for the tree and I have to like immediately leave.

1077
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:02,000
It's made it as like an all-encompassing place that you can most definitely tap into from that end.

1078
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Yeah.

1079
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Oh, go ahead, Charles.

1080
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I can speak a bit to, you know, the Seasonal Powers.

1081
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
As we said, a lot of those Witchcraft Powers are specific to Season 7.

1082
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
That is true.

1083
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
They are not necessarily coming back in Season 8.

1084
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
But we do hear that feedback, right?

1085
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I think they got a really positive reception.

1086
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Yep.

1087
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:25,000
A lot of like the Poison Frog, one of my favorites, you know, the Fire Bats and all kinds of the other things that are very visually flashy and just a lot of fun to play with.

1088
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
We hear that and that definitely helps us to inform like making future content in the past.

1089
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:36,000
We've done that where we've taken some favorite Seasonal Mechanics, put them on items to return.

1090
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I can't speak to any particular plans, but just know that we do hear this feedback and it'll definitely help us to help craft content in the future.

1091
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:56,000
We got a lot of questions related to PTR because I know, as I mentioned, this is a PC Battle.net PTR and there's a few people like Kim from Canada.

1092
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:01,000
And I can't read this because the text color is so just jarring.

1093
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:10,000
But we've gotten a lot of questions related to PTR being on PC Battle.net asking like, hey, is there any plans of bringing it to console, maybe Steam?

1094
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:30,000
I'll say the reason why PC Battle.net works best for us is that Battle.net is a platform that is housed here at Blizzard and is the processes of getting builds up there, making like any type of change, especially for PTR where we're in a smaller window and we may need to change something really quickly.

1095
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Just it gives us more flexibility and allows us to be able to change those things really, really smoothly.

1096
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I know with other platforms and everything, there's more processes involved for good reason because they have more checks and balances and everything.

1097
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:51,000
So it makes it a little bit more difficult on our end to do some of those fast iterations that we may need with PTR.

1098
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:59,000
So in the foreseeable future right now, we see PC Battle.net as being kind of the home for PTRs when we do end up testing anything.

1099
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Question from...

1100
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,000
My computer is telling me to update. It's been telling me for weeks.

1101
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Don't hate me, IT.

1102
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:21,000
ChrisMate says, will the lair bosses have resilience slash damage reduction that the world bosses have to ensure that they just don't get one shot too fast with some classes or builds triv... triv... triv...

1103
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I can't talk today. Triv... I can't talk today. Triv... Triv... Yeah.

1104
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Triv... Triv... Yeah.

1105
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I can't even talk.

1106
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I think this is a great question. It's something we actually talk about on the team a bunch.

1107
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And from our perspective, adding something like resilience would sort of devalue that power progression.

1108
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Like we feel like it sort of disservices that sort of zero to hero. Once Belial was really hard, but now I've gotten so strong I can just crush him.

1109
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:50,000
That said, we do think that the level of one-shotting bosses that has been happening is a little bit too much.

1110
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:56,000
There isn't enough of a journey to get to a point where I can just stomp on Varshawn or I can stomp on the Penant to Knight.

1111
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:02,000
So what we have done is, like Derek mentioned earlier in the stream, we've massively buffed a lot of these bosses.

1112
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Like so much so that we're kind of like, try it on the PTR and see.

1113
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:13,000
But a lot of these bosses should present more of a journey to getting to a place where you can really stomp on them throughout the Torment tiers.

1114
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Even Uberlilith herself has been, or I don't remember what we actually call her.

1115
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Uberlilith.

1116
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Uberlilith.

1117
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
We just keep calling her Uberlilith.

1118
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Uberlilith.

1119
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
It's fine.

1120
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
It's fine.

1121
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Has seen quite a buff.

1122
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:33,000
And that should mean that that journey to getting to a place where you're really farming some of these bosses is a lot more fulfilling, but it's longer also.

1123
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
You're not just like walking into Torment 1 and one-shotting Varshawn.

1124
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Yeah, and that kind of ties into what I talked about with some of the outlier builds that were just like Bloodwave Necro prime example of being something where you get one item and then suddenly you can one-shot everything.

1125
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:51,000
It's really not, it doesn't promote the best gameplay.

1126
01:59:51,000 --> 02:00:02,000
It's just, it's fun for a little bit to go in and one-shot everything, but that's something we think it's much more engaging to have a little bit of back and forth and you're not just going in and stomping them.

1127
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
But you are, you do feel powerful, feel some power progression.

1128
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Yeah.

1129
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:12,000
And as you get more powerful and more gear and more Paragon levels, you do get more powerful and it becomes easier to overcome these challenges.

1130
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
And then you start feeling that real powerful stuff as you really complete your build.

1131
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Yeah, and I'll also say like, I think part of how we originally set up the boss ladder, it really did encourage the one-shotting behavior, right?

1132
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Like if you have to pay materials to fight this boss, why would you ever fight the boss when it's actually a challenge, right?

1133
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
You would only fight it when it's really difficult.

1134
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:46,000
But the changes that we've made have really sort of, you know, in a fun way I'm hoping this plays out that you can sort of maybe get a cheeky run in on Varshan when maybe he's really hard, but you get a really powerful, unique, because you don't have to risk anything anymore when to actually summon him.

1135
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Yeah, I think it also kind of speaks to just the approach of injecting challenge across the lair bosses.

1136
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Like we discussed, you know, we could just do straight stat boosts and that would definitely resolve it.

1137
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:13,000
But within Season 8, the team took the extra opportunity to also just inject new mechanics and updated mechanics to the lair bosses across the board to introduce that hiked challenge, but in an interesting way that's just more fun, I guess, really for us to enjoy.

1138
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:27,000
We have a question related to, I'm going to speed through a few last questions here. Lilith, will Lilith ever make an entry into maybe the boss lair system or anything? This is from Ganon North.

1139
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Yeah, I think that's something that we've been thinking about and like what's the right place and what's the right time for something like that.

1140
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:43,000
She's in an interesting spot now where she's kind of like the pinnacle of the season's journey a lot of times and that's something we can definitely think about, especially with this revamped.

1141
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:49,000
flow of being able to summon the bosses. So we can definitely take that into consideration. That'd be a lot of fun.

1142
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Quick question related to the Spiritborn. This is from The Schwab.

1143
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Does the new Russian Claw aspect power give you all the previous bonuses at 4 plus charges or just the extra cast?

1144
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:09,000
It's just the extra one. So if you're casting it at 4 or more charges, it only hits an extra time. It does not get guaranteed crit or overpower or heal you.

1145
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:15,000
It's you kind of either progress through one benefit at a time or you just get the 4 plus if you're using the new upgrade.

1146
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I'm gonna do two quick last questions. I will end on the one that everyone's asking. I see it in chat. Don't worry.

1147
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:37,000
In regards to... I lost it. There it is. From mid-central vowel, at what point will you start maybe potentially removing uniques that have proven to be not that useful?

1148
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Or do you guys feel like uniques are feeling bloated in the current setup?

1149
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I think... I actually feel like we don't necessarily have enough uniques in terms of speaking to every skill.

1150
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Like I think that's something that you see with the poison trap and you see with ice shards.

1151
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:03,000
That is sort of why we have the boss ladder to give you more deterministic or maybe not deterministic but targeted ways to find some of the uniques you're looking for.

1152
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,000
This lets us have a lot of different uniques but things that you actually have to target.

1153
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:14,000
The other thing I'll just say too is like part of the game is random items and figuring out how to assemble a build out of the random items.

1154
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:21,000
So like we don't want to get to a place where I just sort of log into Diablo and I get all the uniques I want and then I'm sort of done with the game.

1155
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:26,000
And it's just sort of this linear deterministic track through getting the pieces that you want.

1156
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:34,000
But that said, like we're always sort of listening to the feedback and if it does start to feel like where I'm just constantly sifting through things I don't care about.

1157
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Those are things that we can absolutely take a look at.

1158
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Yeah, and I think on the design side when we're looking at unique designs I think there are still some spots in the game like with poison trap this season where there were some skills or some play styles that had, you know, had some threads there.

1159
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:54,000
But it wasn't really a complete and cohesive build and still require a bit more support.

1160
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:02,000
So we're still going to be looking for those opportunities to support builds or play styles that we think are interesting and fun with new uniques every season.

1161
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:08,000
But additionally we are also taking a look at kind of that, you know, the catalog of uniques we have in the game.

1162
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:12,000
So a good example on Rogue again is that the Scoundrel's Leather this season.

1163
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:16,000
That was an item that was sometimes played but not often for its actual unique effect.

1164
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
For some of its affixes actually it was pretty powerful.

1165
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
But its unique effect was pretty lackluster.

1166
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
And so we've done just a whole rework on it.

1167
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
We said, hey, what's the identity of this?

1168
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Well, it's talking to death trap builds in a way, but in a way that wasn't super compelling.

1169
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,000
And so we said, well, let's kind of scrap that existing effect and how can we better support that?

1170
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Let's take another try at this.

1171
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:42,000
So that's one way that we're going to look to find those underused uniques that really maybe don't find a home.

1172
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:48,000
We're going to constantly be reevaluating them and seeing how we can kind of plus them up and make them achieve the potential

1173
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:53,000
and fulfill that build niche that they were intended to do in the first place.

1174
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Alright, I mean, I ended with the last question because everyone's asking this related to aspirational content.

1175
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Is there going to be are there more plans for that?

1176
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Things like whether it's a potential leaderboards to more like endgame type of features and stuff.

1177
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Do we where are we in regards to some of that?

1178
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Yeah, I'll say the team absolutely.

1179
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:22,000
This is top of mind and something that we absolutely want to improve in terms of adding more milestones for you to reach more satisfied.

1180
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,000
more satisfying and more rewarding milestones and celebrating those milestones.

1181
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:31,000
So the team is actively sort of looking at what are ways that we can level up some of the aspirational feel of the game.

1182
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:37,000
I'll also say just in season eight, again, a lot of the torment tiers and bosses have really been leveled up.

1183
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,000
And I'll say again, the pit has been pretty massively buff.

1184
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:49,000
So there are some tuning changes we've made just to make the game the pieces that we have today a little bit more aspirational and challenging and satisfying to overcome.

1185
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:53,000
We really think season seven was a fun candy rush.

1186
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:56,000
And it was a it was a sugar rush, sort of like the smoothie smoothies.

1187
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Everyone's been shrinking behind.

1188
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Everyone not everyone.

1189
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Not everyone.

1190
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Yeah, I got it.

1191
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
There's a note now that says that it got delivered midstream.

1192
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Oh, okay.

1193
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Well, yeah, Marcus redeemed.

1194
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Yeah, but like season seven was really fast.

1195
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:18,000
And we do think when the game reaches that state of where just nothing really you have to work for it and it's just really fast and it's over in a weekend.

1196
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Totally.

1197
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
There's not enough things to work towards.

1198
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:27,000
So we are sort of taking an approach again with some of the balance changes to make some of the game feel a little bit more aspirational.

1199
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
And it's a focus for our team going forward.

1200
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Yeah, and I will say we've had conversations about this.

1201
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I feel like almost weekly Colin and I talk about it a whole lot.

1202
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I know there's a there's a lot of discussions happening and a lot of people thinking about that specifically from that end.

1203
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:53,000
So a huge shout out and thanks to you guys for jumping in and to Ruben, of course, for jumping into the build and running through everything.

1204
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Again, PTR is going to be starting next Tuesday.

1205
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,000
You can early download on PC Battle.net starting Monday afternoon, California time.

1206
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:08,000
And we will have a blog and patch notes and everything available for people to check out immediately after this stream.

1207
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Really looking forward to everyone jumping in, testing out the new boss layer system.

1208
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Of course, the new powers that are associated with it, all the class changes and all the quality of life stuff that we talked about with in terms of like the leveling journey as you're going up within this new season.

1209
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
So really looking forward to everyone jumping in.
