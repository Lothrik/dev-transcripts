00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello Diablo community, welcome to another Diablo 4 Campfire Chat.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is our PTR Campfire Chat for Season 8.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My name is Adam Fletcher, I'm the Director of Community here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Of course I'm joined by this panel.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A lot of familiar faces, do you guys want to introduce yourself?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hi, I'm Colin Feiner, I'm a Design Director on Diablo 4.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey, I'm Derek Nunez, I'm a Lead Seasons Designer here on Diablo 4.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And hi, I'm Charles Dunn, I'm a Class Designer working on the Final Design team.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Awesome, and we're also joined by Ruben, Ruben Marquez, aka Bloodshed.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He's actually behind the scenes, he'll be playing through some gameplay that we're going to be showing off here.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, there he is, he's saying hi, waving.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We'll see more of him here in a little bit with, maybe not Marak, Stan anymore.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We got to see a good minute and a half of him before the stream actually started.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Crazy day.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
First, I do want to start off with that we had a smoothie delivery this morning, and Marcus is not here.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As you can see, I'm here hosting this because he forgot my smoothie in the order.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So I just kicked him off the stream.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, I'm just kidding.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But I told him I'd bring it up because I'm like, oh, my smoothie's not here.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But either way, we have a lot to talk about regarding Season 8.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And that's actually the end of the stream, so that's all I wanted to bring up.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, we have a lot to talk about for Season 8 PTR, but I know a few other topics that we wanted to hit on

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
was kind of related to some of the quality of life stuff that's going to be coming with this specific season

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
based off of feedback and things we've seen within the game.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And also one big topic is around mid-season updates.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's actually something that a lot of people have been asking about.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And we do want to give a little bit of an update on what mid-season updates will be going forward

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and how we're kind of thinking about it from here.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So, Colin, did you want to talk a little bit about how we're planning on doing mid-season updates?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, I think first it's helpful to sort of talk about the history of the mid-season balance patch.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Originally, when we had talked about mid-season, it was pretty early in the lifecycle of Diablo 4.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We would add a ton of items and we do sort of envision doing a lot of big swings

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
in terms of big nerfs to overperforming builds and big buffs to underperforming builds.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But as we've seen, as we've added more progression and things like Season 4 itemization,

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
there's a lot more time investment in terms of getting your build online and really refining and optimizing it.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And what we found is when you put so much time into your character, it feels really bad when we nerf things, right?

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, Season 6 is a great example where you might have done so much work to temper your gear

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and masterwork your gear and level up those paragons that we were really hesitant to do

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
like a big nerf swing as part of the mid-season balance patch.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sort of on the other hand, right, we didn't want to massively buff underperforming builds

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
to match the overperforming builds because we didn't want to create this insane, you know,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
sort of arms race and then we're at pit tier 9000, right?

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It'd be ridiculous.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So what we ended up doing was actually kind of like anemic number of tweaks.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Like they weren't really necessarily making a big impact.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And we took a step back and sort of asked ourselves like, well, what are we actually getting out of this?

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What are you, the players, actually getting out of this?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I think we're at a sort of point where we want to pivot and adjust our philosophy a little bit.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And I think we've already seen some of this philosophy come to life in Season 7.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, exactly.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I know, especially in the beginning of the season, people probably saw us make some tweaks

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
in the first couple of weeks related to some really crazy numbers that maybe they weren't even numbers

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
in some of the stuff that people saw in the start of the actual season.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So all that is to say, I think really what we're going to start taking a look at is not doing massive swings in the midseason,

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but instead focusing our efforts on the launch of a season.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So we're going to take that time and we're going to make sure that like there's a much higher quality launch release

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and taking a lot of that balance time and making sure that when we do launch a season, it's higher quality, right?

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We want the pit tier disparities to be a little bit lower.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We want to make sure that, you know, when a new season launches, the new builds that we're adding are going to be really effective

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and there's a lot of new fun ways to play.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This doesn't mean we're never going to balance or touch the game.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It actually means we're just going to shift our efforts to the beginning of the season.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So early on, we're going to be pretty vigilant in terms of things that are underperforming or way overperforming

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and acting quickly on them.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The goal here is really to get everything closer in terms of like just like less egregious, you know, builds being super, super high up there.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We saw that, I think, specifically in like season six with like the spirit born and it kind of stayed consistent that way.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We know we got a lot of feedback of like, hey, this feels kind of poopy if, you know, my build is like, you know, 30, 40 pit tiers below.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And so the goal is really to kind of bring and keep things more aligned, especially at the start of the season.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So as Colin mentioned, in the first couple of weeks, I know there's going to be more effort in putting tweaks during that time to really respect the player's time as well.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, go ahead.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The timing is really important because like our mid-season updates in the past had come a month or a month and a half into the season once players have been really invested in their build.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And now we're going to be much more focused on rapid updates, you know, within a week or two after the season launch to make sure that if we are making those adjustments, it's at a point where, hey, you're not, you know, you're not complete with the season.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're not done yet.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And you can adjust and you can, you know, make sure that your time is respected in that way.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Definitely.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So to really clarify, you know, when the season launches, I'll use Bloodwave as an example.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That was something we saw pretty early on and it was way too overtuned, right?

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Like you didn't even really have to invest in your character to get to a point where you're godlike.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And that is something that we would probably act quickly on as a part of the next season, for example.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I think like a big point of clarity is like Bloodwave using that as an example is very much an S tier build right now in this season.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
S plus.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
S plus.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, S plus for sure.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I think that the goal is not to immediately take it to F or even immediately take it to C or anything like that.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's really keep it still an S but like also make sure that it's still like at least lined up with like the other builds that might be up there in that top tier.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Conversely too, I just want to make it super clear.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If we see things that we added that are new, for example, if the seasonal powers aren't performing in a way that feels really powerful and crunchy, we're going to be buffing those.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So it's not only looking out for the S plus, it's also looking for the things that missed the mark.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So we're going to be buffing those also.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Awesome.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So I know that players at the start of season eight will see us be a lot more reactionary towards those first couple weeks in the early part of that season.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So yeah, just wanted to clarify that with players because we've seen a lot of questions about mid-season updates.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is this a mid-season update when they see a patch or something like that?

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And so going forward, I know that's going to be the plan as we look at updating the game in the future.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And if you hide things early, I will Liam Nees in your ass.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I will know.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I will know.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There you go.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We heard it first.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Colin's just waiting behind you.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's what he does.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
In the closet.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Like the little demon kid right behind you.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Exactly.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The other thing that we want to talk about is kind of like state of the game, especially with season seven, where we're at and kind of how we're looking at that towards season eight.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think one of the biggest points of feedback we've heard related to season seven is kind of the pace of the game.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You know, sometimes you blink and you're level 20 and you're like, holy crap, what happened?

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So I know you wanted to talk a little bit more about that as well.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah, absolutely.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So just sort of our perspective on season seven has been the progression is very fast, way faster than we sort of expected.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Part of it is a lot of the really cool new seasonal powers.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Part of it's the head hunts being super lucrative and awesome.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And part of it's also just like the seasonal journey and the reputation board.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There's a lot of different ways to get a ton of power in Diablo 4.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And what we've seen is compared to season six, which had a lot of positive feedback as part of our rebound progression model,

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is that a lot of that has sort of gone down the drain in terms of how fast players are chewing through some of the content.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So we actually have a graph that we could look at.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I apologize.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is terrible.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But I just pulled it from the stat, our sort of stat page.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's not the greatest.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But this is a picture of season six.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You can see on the Y-axis here.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was taking roughly people around 15 to 17 hours on average to get to max level.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We felt like that was a pretty good journey, right?

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Part of Diablo is that sort of zero to hero journey.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And part of what's fun about leveling is you start to sort of form a build and find a lot of different pieces early on

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
when you're still forming your character where customization is really fun, right?

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're not necessarily locked into a build.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So we felt like that was a pretty good clip for hitting max level.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's on average, right?

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So you could either go faster or slower depending on sort of how much of a blaster you are.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So we felt like that was a pretty good average, especially with difficulty tiers and your ability to sort of go faster or slower based on your pacing.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And let's go to season seven now.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And it nearly doubled.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So you can see that it was taking about nine hours on average, which is kind of insane, right?

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Again, this is the average.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So if you're, you know, if you're like a Wodijo of the world, it's probably more like two hours or like 30 minutes.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And that was something that we definitely feel like has sort of missed the mark in terms of that initial journey.

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So we are going to be making some changes just to adjust for a lot of the seasonal power and things like that.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We're not going to necessarily nerf the power of the seasonal power.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We still want you to feel powerful.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But we are going to essentially take a look at the one to 25 experience and just smooth that out a little bit,

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
which is going to essentially make the leveling experience a little bit closer to season six.

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So it is going to be a slower from one to 25.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But one thing we've done to sort of compensate that is we've taken a look at the itemization.

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We don't like that rares and sort of magic items immediately disappear after the first five minutes of the game.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah, I think you kind of get to that point.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Like we were talking about if you get to like level 20, you blink and you're level 20.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And then at the same time you blink and you're like, oh, blues and yellows.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Like, I only look at oranges now.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Or like, what's this other color?

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So I know that we have some changes that you wanted to talk about.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, and again, like a lot of this is in the spirit of making sure that zero to hero journey is really satisfying, right?

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's what makes it so awesome when playing Diablo is that sort of I start with nothing and become a god, right?

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So we are taking a look at the itemization so that it doesn't just feel like a slog from one to 25.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What we're going to be doing is, oh, you know what?

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to jump actually into the legendaries really quick because it's really important, a really important part of this.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The other thing that was contributing to this leveling sort of pace was that players are getting a legendary every three to four minutes.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And that's from one to 60.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's not just in the end game.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And it just felt like legendary item quality was just too prevalent across the leveling journey.

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You didn't have, you sort of hit max level.

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
There was no journey to assembling your build.

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You just had everything as part of the codex of power.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So we're also reducing the legendary rate from leveling.

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We're not really touching the end game legendary drop rates, but from leveling we are adjusting that.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And to compensate that, to jump back into the magic and rares.

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We're making it so that magics can have up to two affixes.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So sometimes you're going to find, you know, from your one to 25 journey a pretty good magic item.

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It might actually be better than a rare, for example, because it might have dropped earlier for you.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It might have higher eye power.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And then we're also making it so that rares can sometimes have up to three affixes.

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And what that means is, you know, when you get a drop at level 35 from a whisper cache, right now, you know, in Season 7 it feels terrible when you don't get a legendary item.

186
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Because you just know that it's just not even worth looking at, right?

187
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But now that rare items can have up to three affixes, that means that you might have a really good imprintable base.

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It means all the rares that drop across the game from 1 to 60 could actually be pretty great gear for you.

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Especially with all of our crafting options.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So we think that this helps smooth out the 1 to 60 journey.

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I will caveat that the rare quality is not the best at max level still.

192
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's going to be a lower eye power, so you're not going to have to filter through a bunch of rares at max level.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We're not going to go back to pre-season 4.

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So, yeah, we think this is this sort of smoothing out of the leveling curve, taking a look at the magic rarities or the item qualities,

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
is just going to make the experience feel a lot more rewarding and satisfying as you go through these levels.

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And then I know some of the other items we've been talking about have been a little bit of that torment progression.

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We've seen drastic differences between Season 6 to Season 7, and it's something I know we're making tweaks to.

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, so the other half of Diablo is obviously the max level endgame, right?

199
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And we've heard a ton of feedback that it just feels like a weak endgame right now.

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You can just blast through all the torment tiers.

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There's nothing that's really satisfying about it.

202
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There's nothing to work towards just because you're just getting so much power so frequently and just really crushing this content.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So what we've done here is, if we go to the slide, we've actually given...

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Actually, let me jump into some of the stats here because I think it's really interesting.

205
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A lot of people got to Torment 4 very quickly.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So on average, it was taking players around 15 hours to get to Torment 4.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's roughly double how quickly it took in Season 6, which is kind of insane.

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Again, it's the culmination of Seasonal Powers and all this crazy stuff going on.

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And the other part of it is that 50% of players are actually hitting Torment 4.

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And just from a philosophy standpoint, we really want whatever the hardest Torment tier is, in this case Torment 4, to be aspirational.

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And to us, that means around 10%.

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That means that, you know, if you're really Johnny Badass, you know, you need to be in the top 10% of players to actually get there.

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And it's not hitting the mark.

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So what we're going to do is make some adjustments.

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So Torment 1 is now going to start at Pit Tier 10, which means we've effectively added 10 Pit Tiers to the Pit because now Torment 1 starts earlier.

216
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And then we've also increased the Torment Pit Scaling health by roughly 20% multiplicative and then some damage increases.

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, and that Pit Scaling is, every level of a Pit is multiplicative on previous levels.

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So it's not just like, oh, whatever Pit I was at, it's now 20% harder.

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's actually like kind of stacking 20% every level.

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So the end result is that, you know, a Pit Tier 100 is much harder than it was before.

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And that will, that makes it, you know, harder to reach that absolute highest end.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And it gives you a little bit more for those builds and those Blasters who are getting up to that highest Pit Tier.

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There's going to be, it's going to be quite a bit harder to get to quite that same level next season.

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, absolutely.

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So with that, sort of culminates in moving Torment 1 to Pit Tier 10 and effectively adding 10 Pit Tiers

226
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and increasing the multiplicative scaling of the Pit Tier scaling is the journey is going to be a lot more sort of satisfying.

227
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There's a lot more sort of peaks to climb.

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And it also means Pit Tier 150 is going to be very difficult.

229
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So, so difficult that I don't believe any of you will reach it.

230
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know, I'll do something silly on the stream.

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He says this now.

232
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll probably, oh, that's not enough for doing something silly on the stream.

233
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And then like within the first stream.

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's a challenge to all of you out there.

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, you all can vote on the silly thing that I do.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But conversely, I just want to cover this really quickly though.

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Torment 4 isn't going to be insanely harder than it was before.

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's going to be roughly around Pit Tier 76 is on live right now.

239
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So season 7.

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So think about the game that you're playing right now.

241
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Torment 4 is going to be about 11 Pit Tiers harder.

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So it's still achievable.

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's just that upper end is also just going to be that much harder to sort of climb through.

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Awesome.

245
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So we've got a lot of changes coming for like Torment Scaling.

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Obviously some itemization changes.

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So the big thing being as you're leveling up, you're going to see a lot more opportunities to find items.

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Especially with the changes to blue and yellow items there.

249
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And then of course, as you mentioned, the big caveat is like at 60, the item power on Legendaries is still going to be the best method and the best items to actually grab.

250
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So yeah, lots of big changes coming up.

251
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Great to actually walk through all of them.

252
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I know we have a ton more to talk about specifically around the new season.

253
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So thank you, Colin.

254
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We're going to jump over to Derek because I know we do want to talk about the new season and what players are actually going to be experiencing in this PTR.

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Again, just to redefine what PTR is for some people because I got messages from people going like, well, PTRs are sometimes buggy.

256
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And I'm like, well, it's a PTR.

257
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So it is like a beta or an alpha, an early look into a game.

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So we expect that.

259
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There will be like known issues and we'll actually have those known issues on our forums.

260
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So people can actually see them.

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You can report bugs.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It actually helps when you guys actually jump into a PTR and experience it and give us feedback because that helps tweak the start of the season for the better, essentially.

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But with season eight, we will be having, of course, a PTR and we'll be talking about it here in a second.

264
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:39,000


265
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And then we'll be talking about that.

266
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And we'll be talking about it.

267
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But we're actually working on season seven and really amplify or celebrate or enhance it within that respective season.

268
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So we've seen that with season four with the Helltide revamps and whatnot, as you mentioned.

269
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Season seven was the emphasis on the Tree of Whispers and bounties.

270
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So as Colin kind of mapped out the journey to the endgame, we wanted to shine focus on a major endgame feature, namely surrounding our bosses.

271
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And we have a lot of really cool bosses in the world of Sanctuary, but more specifically the lair boss system, or as some of us, and we reference it to as the boss ladder.

272
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So season eight focus is on the lair boss system.

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
We're going to be doing a whole mess of new things to it.

274
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So we're adding new bosses, new mechanics, quality of life updates, and a revamped materials loop that I'm going to be covering throughout the course of this segment.

275
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So, you know, first I just want to kind of talk about, you know, the new bosses and additions to the roster.

276
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So when we're talking about the lair bosses, these are like the biggest, baddest, you know, bosses of Sanctuary.

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So we're looking at how do we add to the roster in a meaningful way, but also which bosses do we add that are impactful and versatile enough to carry the entire theme of a season.

278
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So with that in mind, we're just asking ourselves a question of which of the right bosses to bring.

279
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You mentioned an old friend.

280
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So we had to choose something that was versatile.

281
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We had to choose something that was big, bad.

282
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So that's where we go to Belial.

283
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes, season eight, Belial's return.

284
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Belial's back in Sanctuary.

285
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He is climbing his way to the top of the lair boss ladder.

286
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
He is the new, you know, exalted pinnacle challenge within the ladder.

287
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He is the highest challenge, the highest reward.

288
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And he also has some very unique reward related tricks up his sleeve that I'll cover a little bit later.

289
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So for now, just know that Belial's back and he's also just not joining the party alone.

290
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He's bringing a couple of friends from our vessel of hatred.

291
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So first up is our buddy Urvar.

292
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So Urvar's joining the roster of the lair boss ladder system.

293
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He's going to be filling out kind of like the lowest rung of the ladder.

294
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So he's going to be joining the party with the Varshawns and the Beast of Nice and whatnot.

295
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So Urvar's back and we're also bringing back another vessel of hatred.

296
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
A character, the Harbinger of Hatred.

297
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm so happy for this.

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, no, this one.

299
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I love this fight.

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We're going to see a little bit more of this guy in just a little bit.

301
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But the Harbinger of Hatred will be joining kind of the second rung of the ladder with the likes of Durial and Undarial.

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And one thing I just do want to stress is that both of these Vessel of Hatred bosses will dip into the shared loot pools of other bosses within their respective tier.

303
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But also have some additional bonuses that is specific to the Vessel of Hatred like being a great source of tributes and runes.

304
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But Belial, for all intents and purposes, is available to everyone and he is just the new pinnacle challenge of the boss ladder.

305
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
So you're saying even harder than Durial and Undarial right now.

306
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
He's going to be harder, more rewarding than even those.

307
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Absolutely.

308
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes.

309
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
New top tier.

310
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
New top tier.

311
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Belial, Lord of Lies, he does not mess around.

312
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And I'm really excited about this because I think this is going to pair really well with the sort of leveling journey and the torment progression where we're making things a little bit more aspirational, a little bit more challenging.

313
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's really like a return to the heart of the Diablo experience, right?

314
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Sort of leveling from nothing and taking on these huge big bads to claim their loot.

315
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah, absolutely.

316
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I think that's kind of like the inherent cool thing about the Lair Boss ladder system is that you start with like the initiate level floor.

317
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You take those on, you graduate to the next level.

318
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And then now you have kind of Belial just always there looming over you as kind of the aspirational, yes, I get to go fight him now.

319
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But for those who know about our buddy Belial, Lord of Lies, you know that he kind of appears in different forms.

320
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So this is what we're kind of referencing as like his supreme form that appears at the top of the Lair Boss ladder.

321
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But he also has his, I guess, smaller, more agile, compact form.

322
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I like to affectionately refer to him as baby Belial, but this is Belial in his more compact form.

323
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And throughout the course of the season, or I guess just the Lair Boss mechanics, he's going to be popping up all over the place.

324
00:21:46,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But I'm really excited about this version of Belial's new role in the Lair Boss ladder system in the sense that defeating and looting any of the Lair Bosses has a small percent chance to initiate a surprise ambush from Belial himself.

325
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And this is really cool because this is kind of like a two for the price of one payout.

326
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So let's say I fight Andario, I defeat Andario, I loot Andario, and I get this special ambush triggered.

327
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And if I defeat Belial, I'll get a double payout of Andario's loot.

328
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So I got the loot from Andario, and I get another payout of Andario's loot from defeating Belial himself.

329
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So it's a really exciting kind of just like injection of some fun novel mechanics within the Lair Boss system that we're doing over and over and over again.

330
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So again, really excited about this update.

331
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And again, in the spirit of teasing kind of the rewards relationship and connection that Belial has,

332
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
this version of Belial has a very special connection to his larger supreme form in the Lair Boss ladder that I'll touch upon a little bit later.

333
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
A lot of teasing that I'm kind of just sending that.

334
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
There's a lot to go over.

335
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
We're going to lie to everybody.

336
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah.

337
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,000
We're just kidding.

338
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We're just kidding.

339
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's the theme.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Belial's actually not here.

341
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This is a lie.

342
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah.

343
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah.

344
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So that was that.

345
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That was the, you know, the Belial ambushes.

346
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But I also want to talk about some additional major sweeping updates that's coming in with just the system as a whole.

347
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And I want to talk about the summoning materials.

348
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
As we know, the way that the system currently functions is, you know, you go do activities, you get summoning items, you go visit the boss and you plop them in, you summon the boss.

349
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And then, you know, that's kind of just a flow.

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So when we're looking at the Lair Boss system, we don't just look about ways that we can add to it.

351
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We also look about, you know, opportunities to, you know, resolve or reduce some frictions or just areas for improvement that we can have with it.

352
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Since it's a very mature system, we get a lot of feedback that we, you know, diligently ingest and talk about and whatnot on our team.

353
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So when it came to the summoning materials, we identified a couple of key points of, I guess, friction that players are currently having with it.

354
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:07,000
One is, since you have to ante up your summoning materials just to summon the boss, it's kind of a feels-bad moment when you realize that you just wasted, you know, X number of materials to find out that you can't defeat Durial.

355
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Like, okay, that's a waste of materials, back to the loop, maybe I'll fight him another week or two, depending on how fast you are.

356
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And it's just generally not a great feeling for myself or for players and whatnot.

357
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah, I definitely have run into this where it's like, I'm only going to fight the boss when I can guarantee win against it.

358
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Right.

359
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Right.

360
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So you never actually fight-

361
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And how do you know that, too, until, like, trial and error?

362
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Like, you never really have that, like, actual fun fight with the boss where you're like, oh, am I going to lose or not?

363
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Because it's like, well, I'm just not going to risk it.

364
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, I've had times where I'm like, I don't know if my build's quite ready, so I'll try to fight a boss.

365
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And then I'm like, oh, this is really tough.

366
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Like, I die a couple times, and I'm like, do I really want to keep, like, retrying it?

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah.

368
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Because, like, well, I've already invested.

369
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm kind of, like, I'm kind of committed.

370
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So with this new way, you know, I don't need to invest those right up front.

371
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I can just go and fight them right away and see how strong I am without risking the materials.

372
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So we're going to cover, like, the specificities of the new system and how it all works in a little bit.

374
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But the other kind of pain point that we identified with the current system is also just in regards to, like, the party play.

375
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I think my little earpiece is coming out of my ear.

376
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000
There you go.

377
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's a common theme on this one.

378
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The earpiece just pops out all the time.

379
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We do it live here.

380
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah, so the other element is just the party play, right?

381
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And as much as we want to kind of, like, entrust in our fellow man and whatnot and engage in the boss rotations and whatnot,

382
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
we have seen, you know, some areas of friction where certain players don't engage in the boss rotations

383
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and they don't submit their materials.

384
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Like, no one watching this stream would ever be guilty of this, but that does happen.

385
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's shocking, but it does happen.

386
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Belial is on the other side of the computer.

387
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's like, yeah, I'll definitely pay the next rotation.

388
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And then they leave and they take all their stuff.

389
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So that was another kind of area of friction that we experienced with the current summoning materials.

390
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So I think that's kind of enough of a preface just to set the tone for where the system is going now that we're introducing Season 8.

391
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So what are we doing?

392
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What are we?

393
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't know.

394
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Let's find out.

395
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,000
All right.

396
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So Lair Keys.

397
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So summoning materials are effectively being repurposed in their roles as a new item called Lair Keys.

398
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And what Lair Keys do, well, I'll just start with this, is since there's no more summoning materials,

399
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
that just means that effectively all Lair bosses are free to summon.

400
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So if you're not sure if you're ready to take on a Varshan or a Durial, just go visit them.

401
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You know, kind of use them as a bit of a training dummy to see if you can actually, you know, take them on.

402
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But what Lair Keys now do is they grant access to the defeated boss's horde or their treasure chest that they drop.

403
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So now I'll just walk you through kind of the new flow.

404
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Imagine this with me.

405
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So you enter Durial's Lair.

406
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You walk up to his altar and you just click the altar to summon him.

407
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Again, no cost to you.

408
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You fight Durial.

409
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You defeat him.

410
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Out pops his horde.

411
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And now the Shards of Agony, which is now the Lair Key, you use that to open his horde and get all the oodles of loot that he went to go visit him to do.

412
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah.

413
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And these work like Helltide chests.

414
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So you have to pay in order to get the loot.

415
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And the only loot comes from the person who pays.

416
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah.

417
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That's a very important distinction is that now every member in the party needs to have the appropriate type and quantity of the Lair Keys to access the loot in the horde.

418
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And you can still trade your keys with friends and things like that.

419
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If you have 9999, you know, Durial mats, you can split them in half and give them to your buddies to open the chest.

420
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah, absolutely.

421
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Sharing is caring in the system here.

422
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And then, of course, if you're really lucky, you'll get a Belial ambush and you can get double loot.

423
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah.

424
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah, there you go.

425
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So, again, a lot of new avenues and ways to kind of, you know, experience the system.

426
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So we also have the Stygian Stones.

427
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So Stygian Stones in Season 8 is living a new life now in the sense that we wanted to ensure that every boss in the first rung of the ladder,

428
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
our Initiate Lair bosses, the Varshans, Griggers, Beasts of Nice, Lord Zeres, and Urvars now,

429
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
that they're all equally relevant to getting you to climb to the next rung.

430
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So in addition to, you can take a screenshot of this chart here.

431
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I won't try and walk through the entire thing.

432
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But now Stygian Stones is a drop that can drop from any of the Initiate Lair Boss tier here.

433
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And you can crush them into your Lair Key of Choice for the second rung of the Lair Bosses.

434
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So let's say I fight Grigger, I get a Stygian Stone, and I want to go fight Ondariel.

435
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I can just crush that into some Ondariel keys.

436
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And, again, just giving a little bit more flexibility in how players actually engage and progress through the Lair Boss ladder.

437
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Again, as we know, all roads lead to Belial, Lord of Lies, you know, the top of the pinnacle of the ladder at the end.

438
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Ooh, there's a lot.

439
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
All right, final thing here is the item bloat reduction.

440
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So, again, with this new system, we're consolidating all the Lair Keys to one Lair Key type per boss.

441
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So no more kind of managing two different materials.

442
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And so I have enough material.

443
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I have two of these, five of these.

444
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's just one material per boss.

445
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
We're increasing the item stacking of these to 99.

446
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Again, to cut down on some of that bloat.

447
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And one of my personal favorites here is that we're also normalizing the counts of required Lair Keys per, you know, boss rank.

448
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So all the initiate tiered bosses, they require the same quantity of their respective keys.

449
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So, too, do the graders and whatnot.

450
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So, again, it's just cutting down on the total mental math and memory that is kind of affecting the, I guess, like, on-ramping enjoyment of the current system.

451
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah.

452
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And Ondariel only needs one material, for example, as part of this.

453
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah, absolutely.

454
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So you can see in this chart here, you have Pincushion Dolls, Shard of Agony, or the Stygian Stone is kind of the wild card that you can crush to any one of them.

455
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So let's say if Ondariel needed four Pincushion Dolls, you have three of them, but you have one Stygian Stone.

456
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You can crush that into a Pincushion Doll and go get Ondariel's Horde.

457
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So, all right.

458
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That was a pretty big overview and a lot of talking in charts.

459
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But I want to take the time to, you know, throw it over to Ruben and behind the scenes here and kind of just get into just what this all looks like as part of this in-game flow.

460
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Hello, Derek.

461
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,000
How are you doing, man?

462
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm doing great.

463
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
How are you?

464
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Awesome.

465
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah.

466
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Let me open up the menu for you.

467
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,000
All right.

468
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Cool.

469
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So, in this walkthrough, I'm just going to show you kind of, or we're going to show you rather, the new flow to access the lair bosses with a little bit of a sneak peek of the Harbinger of Hatred.

470
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So, one thing I want to just call out real quick is kind of some of the quality of life updates that we've taken to just the map presentation and the boss dungeon tooltips themselves.

471
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I'll kind of just go through these kind of itemized order.

472
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So, first, all of the boss dungeon map icons have been given a little bit of a beautification treatment.

473
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So, they're a little bit more bold, red, and easier to identify against the sea of other icons on the map.

474
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But now I want to talk about the tooltip, and I'll just start from the top and go make my way down.

475
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So, the first quality of life update that we added was just simply printing the name of the boss that resides within the dungeon.

476
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You know, one of the kind of ambiguities that we had with the previous version of this system was not knowing specifically which boss lives in which dungeon.

477
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Like, oh, who does live in the gaping crevice or who lives in the malignant tunnels?

478
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So, now you can see here that the Harbinger of Hatred lives in the Harbinger's Den.

479
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
This is probably not the best example because who else would live in the Harbinger's Den?

480
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Wow.

481
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah, but he technically does live in every single one of them.

482
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,000
He's a liar.

483
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah.

484
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You don't know where he's at.

485
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But yeah, so you can see here now, we print the name of the lair boss that lives in the dungeon for a little bit easier find.

486
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Instead of the main body description, we also just give a little bit more guidance and information on, you know, what the value of defeating this boss is,

487
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and they're directing players to the fact that they are a source of ancestral and mythic unique items.

488
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The last two updates here are some of my favorites of this is that we also display now the required items that you need to access the lair boss's horde.

489
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
If you recall the previous, you know, iteration, that was not apparent to you,

490
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
so you would kind of like waste the time traveling to the boss just to find out that, oh, I have three or four abhorrent's hearts,

491
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
so I can't fight the boss yet.

492
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So we wanted to, again, just smoothen out the access and onboarding to the feature.

493
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And I think my absolute favorite update of all this is you see at the bottom,

494
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
we now have the ability to travel directly into the dungeon directly from the map.

495
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So, again, no more teleporting to the nearest waypoint.

496
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We just pop directly in and just get into it.

497
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And, you know, we have Ruben loading into here, and I think this is a great time to just outline.

498
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Outline, I've talked about the new bosses, I've talked about new mechanics,

499
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
but we have a, you know, a collection of really great existing lair bosses.

500
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And one thing that we wanted to take as an opportunity within the season was to also enhance every other lair boss that exists within the system.

501
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So every lair boss is getting a bit of a difficulty spike and new mechanics to, again,

502
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
freshen up the fights that we've been, you know, knowing and love.

503
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So if you fought, you know, the Varshawns or the Durials or even the Liliths, you know, over and over and over again,

504
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
all this is in the PTR, so definitely worth checking them out again to see what's changed and, you know, how much different their experience is.

505
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Yeah, Durial has some messed up surprises.

506
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah, Durial eats you.

507
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Why are you spoiling it?

508
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Why are you spoiling it?

509
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's definitely worth checking out the mechanics.

510
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But again, so this is the Harbinger of Hatred, and, you know, just as a reminder,

511
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
one thing that we do when we add a boss to the lair boss system is we don't just take the carbon copy, you know, campaign version of it.

512
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We also take the opportunity to inject some really crazy mechanics.

513
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So I don't necessarily want to, you know, kind of spoil the surprises of the Harbinger of Hatred's mechanics here,

514
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
but he does get pretty wild.

515
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
This is a spectacle and a half of a fight, and I'm really excited to have players check it out.

516
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So, yeah, I think this is about all we might want to show of this guy.

517
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah, we probably won't go into it.

518
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
We don't want to spoil all the mechanics and everything,

519
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
even though we're kind of also spoiling a little bit of, like, a rogue build.

520
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah, we have a teen-eyed amongst you might have noticed some interesting things on rogue,

521
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
which I'll get to in a bit.

522
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's spoil or it's teasing to maintain.

523
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Exactly.

524
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Teasing, teasing.

525
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Teasing everyone along here.

526
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But, yeah, so, you know, that was a sneak peek at the Harbinger of Hatred we just talked about again,

527
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
in case you missed it, the all-lair bosses are getting a boost in both their performance

528
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and just the mechanics that they have.

529
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Yep.

530
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But let's, you know, we fast-forwarded past, you know, the Harbinger of Hatred's fight,

531
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
so let's imagine a world that, you know, we fought through the whole thing, we killed him,

532
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
and let's show off now what to expect from the Horde loop flow.

533
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So we have some footage here with this very shiny chest.

534
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Very shiny chest.

535
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So we have four of Horan's hearts, and now we can open up the chest.

536
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Again, each one of us needs to have it.

537
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And I mentioned that Belial has a chance to surprise ambush you after opening any Horde.

538
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And here you go.

539
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Look at this.

540
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
This is meant to be a relatively rare occurrence, but, you know, this is the magic of pre-recorded footage.

541
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
We can make the impossible happen.

542
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And in this case, again, painting the full picture of the scenario,

543
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
you defeated the Harbinger of Hatred, you got the Horde, you opened it,

544
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
you got baby Belial, you killed him, and now you get another proc of, yeah, double the loot, double the fun.

545
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yeah, double the loot of what you just essentially got.

546
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
With the one-time payment of the layer keys that you deposited.

547
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So, yeah, it really is, you know, kind of a two-for-one sale that Belial has for you.

548
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And if you noticed, you might have seen, we did keep a bonus for party play.

549
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So while you do have to pay to get the chest and open up the Horde,

550
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
we kept a bonus chance for loot.

551
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So we love that people enjoy fighting the bosses as parties,

552
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and we know that that's a fun social experience in Diablo.

553
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So what we've done is the Hordes themselves will have bonus chances for loot when you are in a party.

554
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And that does scale with party members.

555
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yep, no, absolutely.

556
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So, yeah, a lot of loot everywhere to give.

557
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And on the topic at the very top, I teased that Belial had a very special kind of role in the reward structure,

558
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
different from every other boss.

559
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So defeating the ambush version of Belial is not just lucrative in the sense that it's a double payout.

560
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
He is also the sole source of the layer keys that you need to access his Supreme Form at the top of the ladder,

561
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
the Supreme Form's Horde.

562
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So I want to show off now the Supreme Belial's very green chest here.

563
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So you can see here, it doesn't open up right away.

564
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I have some options.

565
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So the really cool thing about the Supreme Belial's Horde is that you can set it to mimic the reward drops of any other existing lair boss.

566
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So let's say if you are trying to do Durial runs to get the special stuff that he has,

567
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and you can set your Belial to drop the Durial loot, and he will do so at an enhanced rate.

568
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So it's even better than if you just went to go fight Durial specifically.

569
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, so if you're really targeting Farmane and those specific uniques, you get, you know,

570
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
this version of Belial just gives you a much better chance of doing that as well.

571
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Yep, absolutely.

572
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And not just that in terms of, like, his value, he also guarantees one Ancestral unique drop per kill,

573
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and he's also a really great source of the Infernal compasses.

574
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So, you know, if you want to, you know, empower your Infernal Horde runs and whatnot,

575
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,000
it's never a waste of time to go visit the Belial Supreme at the top of the ladder here.

576
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah, and this is in Torment 2, and it all scales with Torment.

577
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Exactly, yeah.

578
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah, what we're seeing in this footage is just Torment 2, so obviously, like, Torment 4,

579
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
you would get more loot out of it because it's a much more difficult challenge.

580
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It is much more difficult.

581
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It scales with the Torment tiers, and also if we were in a party in this example here,

582
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
we'd get even, you know, more chances of great stuff out of it as well.

583
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
That's exactly right.

584
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
All right, cool.

585
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Well, that is the Lair Key and the Lair Boss.

586
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I just have a lot of things to cover here.

587
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I know we want to talk a little bit about kind of the...

588
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It's funny because people saw it as Reuben was on the map,

589
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
because they probably saw a term, like, with apparitions and everything.

590
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Right, yeah, there's a lot of teasing in this.

591
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I know, a lot of teasing.

592
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
This happens when you use a live build and everything's fine.

593
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah, it's exciting.

594
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But one thing, before we hop into the next thing,

595
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I do want to reestablish so that everything that we just talked about

596
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
as far as what we're introducing to the Lair Boss system

597
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and all the mechanics, new bosses and whatnot,

598
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that is permanent.

599
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That is just how the system works now.

600
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So everything is getting introduced in Season 8,

601
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
but it's not leaving beyond Season 8.

602
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
It is just there.

603
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It'll be an Eternal, so...

604
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It will, yeah.

605
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It'll be an Eternal.

606
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
That's just how the system works.

607
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
What the next segment, though, is

608
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
is all the Seasonal-specific stuff.

609
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So, again, as Adam mentioned,

610
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
you might have seen some Apparition and Incursion things pop up.

611
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So let's get into the first kind of seasonal-related content here.

612
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh, the top says Lair Boss.

613
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Okay.

614
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Anyways, we do it live.

615
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Apparition and Incursions.

616
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Apparition and Incursions is a new open-world seasonal event

617
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
to empower your leveling journeys

618
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and also kind of just spread the narrative and dramas

619
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
of Belial is back on Sanctuary

620
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and he's spreading his own sense of, you know,

621
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
twisted realities across the land.

622
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
He's always in his efforts to try and plunge, you know,

623
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
the world of Sanctuary into his Realm of Lies

624
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and he's doing it through this fast-paced boss rush style event

625
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
that kind of takes the spirit of, you know,

626
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
the open-world social boss play of the Blood Maiden

627
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and making a really cool kind of just really fast-paced,

628
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
you know, bam, bam, bam, boss rush style event.

629
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So I think we have some footage here

630
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
just to put some, yeah, some visuals to it.

631
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So, you know, this is an area of the world

632
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
that Belial's apparitions are kind of overtaking

633
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
and throughout the course,

634
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
players are going to be defeating these apparitions

635
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
to draw out up to two of his apparition bosses.

636
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
This is pulled from a total of 10 potential apparition bosses.

637
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So each time you go through this,

638
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
you'll fight, you know, two of them kind of randomized.

639
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So each time should be a little bit different.

640
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And all of this is leading up to a showdown

641
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
against Belial himself.

642
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So again, it's celebrating bosses.

643
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's three bosses per event.

644
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And the idea for this is that they're up pretty much 24-7.

645
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So we want to just encourage that, you know,

646
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
hop on the boss train, ride it to the end,

647
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
find the next one, and just, you know,

648
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
go to your heart's content.

649
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And, you know, celebration of bosses this season, really.

650
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Absolutely.

651
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And what do you get for killing those bosses?

652
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Oh, you're going to get some cool stuff, Colin.

653
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Let's go to the next slide.

654
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That kind of leads us into the collectible boss powers,

655
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
seasonal powers.

656
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Spoiled it right there.

657
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's already on the slide.

658
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's already on the slide.

659
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah, we're fine.

660
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So the theme for, the powers theme for Season 8 is boss powers.

661
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So Belial being kind of like the illusionary character he is,

662
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
mimicry and whatnot, in Season 8,

663
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
players will be acquiring the ability to steal and mimic the powers

664
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
of up to 24 targeted bosses across Sanctuary.

665
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So we have 24 collectible powers that are gathered

666
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
from the first time kill of targeted bosses

667
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
across the full content from level 1 till the very top.

668
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So you asked about, you know,

669
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
what do the apparition bosses give you?

670
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
They're, aside from the loot and all that stuff,

671
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
they're also your first source of your first 10 boss powers

672
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
that make up the magic tiers.

673
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You can kind of see in this little chart here.

674
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Graduating from the apparition bosses,

675
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
you now go into the world bosses.

676
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So each one of our three world bosses

677
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
have a power associated with them.

678
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And then so too do each of our lair bosses,

679
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
capped off with Lilith with her own boss power

680
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
that you can acquire.

681
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's like a ladder in the boss power.

682
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah, it's definitely celebrating the progression journey

683
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
of bosses from, you know, the moment you log in

684
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
to the moment that you're powerful enough

685
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
to take down Lilith.

686
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Belial, you know, Belial being kind of like

687
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
the star of the season.

688
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
He's special. He gets two powers

689
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
because that's just how he rolls.

690
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Yeah, cheating.

691
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah.

692
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And I think, you know, one of the cool things

693
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
about this kind of structure,

694
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
it's a very structured power climb.

695
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So little ambiguity of like,

696
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
how do I get the Wandering Deaths power?

697
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Well, go fight and kill him.

698
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's just that nice little structured journey

699
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
that kind of is a nice little stamp collection

700
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
just to reward each kind of a tier of progression

701
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
that you make across your, you know,

702
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
leveling and endgame journeys.

703
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But that's not just the coolest part of it.

704
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
In my opinion here is that it's also just

705
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
how the powers work this season.

706
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So you can see that we have four slots,

707
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
the top slot and three little kind of like supporting slots.

708
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So the really cool thing is that each one of these powers

709
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
have two sides to them that activate

710
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
depending on which power slot you put them in.

711
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So you can have up to one main,

712
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
one power, you can have up to one power slot

713
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
into your main power slots,

714
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
or you can have up to three power slot

715
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
into your modifier slots.

716
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And I just want to dive into this

717
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Wandering Deaths chest beam example here.

718
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So if I were to slot the Wandering Deaths power

719
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
into the main power slot,

720
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I would actually unlock the full representation

721
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
of his iconic chest beam power.

722
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So the main powers is activating and unlocking

723
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
the actual iconic power

724
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
that is representative of the boss.

725
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
We're going to show kind of a little bit

726
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
of a showcase after this, but that's how

727
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that respective area of the power system works.

728
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The modifier slots though are super,

729
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
are cool and powerful in an own right though.

730
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So let's say I don't necessarily need

731
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the Wandering Deaths, you know,

732
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
main power for whatever utility purposes.

733
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I can still get value out of the fact that I own it

734
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
by slotting it into the modifier slots,

735
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
which activates kind of like the side B of it,

736
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
which is more of a supporting thing.

737
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So in this case, it's your main power.

738
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Now it empowers your main power

739
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
to instantly execute non-boss enemies,

740
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
you know, when they're within a certain threshold of life.

741
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So it's not just, you know,

742
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
24 ways to kind of express your, you know,

743
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
sense of power this season.

744
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's 48 because each of these powers have,

745
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
you know, kind of like two sides to them.

746
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, it's really like build your own boss power.

747
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Essentially, yeah.

748
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's a lot of fun just kind of like

749
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
mix-match slot around and see, you know,

750
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
what kind of a concoction you come up with.

751
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And that's something that I'm particularly interested

752
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
in going to the PTR is like,

753
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
what are some of the favorite combinations?

754
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Or, you know, ideally,

755
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
what are the favorite combinations

756
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
based off of the circumstance that you're going into?

757
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Definitely.

758
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Oh, go ahead, Charles.

759
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
One thing I wanted to,

760
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
that I'm really excited about the system

761
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
is in previous seasonal power systems,

762
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
we sometimes found as you got really high,

763
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
you know, Paragon levels,

764
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
your build is like super powerful.

765
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
The relative impact of some of the seasonal powers

766
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000
was a little lower.

767
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
They didn't really scale with you

768
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
as well as we really wanted to.

769
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
We've done an update in this season

770
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
where these boss powers are going to scale

771
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
with your Paragon level as you're leveling up.

772
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And so they actually are going to get more powerful

773
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
as you get more powerful.

774
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So the exact number that you,

775
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
as soon as you unlock it,

776
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
it, you know, maybe is not the most powerful thing,

777
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
but as you're powering up,

778
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
it's still going to be relevant to your build

779
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
at every stage of your progression.

780
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
That's really good.

781
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And I like the fact that the powers

782
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
don't kind of just live on their own little island.

783
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Like they get ingrained into the other systems

784
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
that we're engaging with.

785
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So, yeah, so that's a high level

786
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
of the boss powers for season eight.

787
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And I want to toss it back to Ruben

788
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
for just kind of a little bit of a live showcase of them.

789
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Hey, Derek, thanks for all that.

790
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That was great, man.

791
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah, I'm excited.

792
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
What do you got for us?

793
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Well, I get the fun job of showcasing

794
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
all these powers today,

795
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
but I must confess I got my smoothie,

796
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
so I'm a little jacked up today.

797
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm so happy you got your smoothie.

798
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So happy for you.

799
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I try not to talk too fast.

800
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm thrilled.

801
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm thrilled.

802
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Let's go ahead and open up our inventory here.

803
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And you'll notice on the left side,

804
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
a familiar tab is our seasonal tab,

805
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
which is boss powers.

806
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So from this tab is where you'll be kind of interacting

807
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
with your powers throughout the season.

808
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Like Derek mentioned,

809
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
you can drag and drop them,

810
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
equip them on the fly.

811
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,000
There's no penalty.

812
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I think the team and everybody wants you

813
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
to experiment and have fun with the builds.

814
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
You can also upgrade them by hovering over them.

815
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
There's a corresponding button here on PC.

816
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It's F.

817
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So go ahead and push that to upgrade them.

818
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And yeah, so the top slot is your main slot,

819
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,000
like Derek mentioned.

820
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
This is where your main powers go.

821
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And all the bottom ones are your modifier slots.

822
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So right here, you know,

823
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Derek's favorite was the wandering death chest beam.

824
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So as a modifier, right, you can execute enemies.

825
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But as soon as you drag it over here,

826
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
boom, now it's a channeled ability.

827
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And you'll notice right away, it's a prominent beam.

828
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah, it works well with channeled abilities.

829
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It only works with channeled abilities, actually.

830
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And it's kind of cool with densive knives

831
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
because you can adjust and do these micro adjustments

832
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
to kind of maximize the effect on your target

833
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and just to keep it on them a little bit longer.

834
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yeah, and as you can kind of tell,

835
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
we're not necessarily going for subtlety

836
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
in terms of the expression of these powers this season.

837
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm dying.

838
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Someone in chat's like, Goku?

839
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Oh, my God.

840
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I also want to call it real quick.

841
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Just one thing I absolutely love

842
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
is just the animations of the UI itself.

843
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And, you know, you slot these little, like, eyeball socket,

844
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
eyeball powers into the little eye sockets,

845
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and it blinks.

846
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And it just is kind of just fun across the board,

847
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
just engaging with this.

848
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Squelchers and pops.

849
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Yeah.

850
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So what do we got next?

851
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
The next one I want to showcase is Lilith's Wind of Hate

852
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
just because probably most of us have died to this before,

853
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
her spike ability from the ground.

854
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And it works on almost every skill.

855
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So you can definitely,

856
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
you can see as soon as I dash here,

857
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I get the spikes.

858
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
With Barrage, you get the spikes.

859
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So you can slot in almost every build

860
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,000
and have fun with it,

861
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
even Dance of Knives.

862
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Really cool ability there.

863
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Let's see what else we got.

864
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Another fun one,

865
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
there's a transformative ability,

866
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
is Juryal's Burrow.

867
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So it completely changes your evade skill,

868
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and you burrow underground.

869
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You deal damage when you go into the ground

870
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
and when you exit.

871
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
But the real cool thing is you become immune while underground,

872
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
and you can control the direction.

873
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Oh, that's awesome.

874
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
It is awesome.

875
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
That's one of my absolute favorite.

876
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I love that one.

877
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You can stand still if you like or whatever,

878
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and it scales.

879
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
As you get more evade charges,

880
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
you get more burrows.

881
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So I'm sure there's a lot of,

882
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
especially adding three new bosses

883
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
with all kinds of crazy effects,

884
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
you can now dodge them a little bit easier,

885
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
which is great.

886
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm sure there's some good use cases for that.

887
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah, and even just right there,

888
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I want to just chime in and just say that,

889
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
you know, we showed off a power

890
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
that procs off of the evade.

891
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
We showed one that procs off channeling,

892
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and one that procs off any skills.

893
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
One of the goals going into the design of these powers

894
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
was to just remove any ambiguity

895
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
about how do I actually proc it.

896
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We wanted to make it as utility-focused

897
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and straightforward as possible

898
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
so that players can really easily digest

899
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
and how they work it into their builds.

900
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah, that's a great point.

901
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Urvar's Bombs is probably my personal favorite

902
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
as I like making builds and interesting builds.

903
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
This definitely supports ultimate builds,

904
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
and as you can see on the screen here,

905
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
it lowers your cooldown by five seconds,

906
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,000
which is great,

907
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and gives you a nice damage component

908
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
to kind of top off on it.

909
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So we're playing Rogue,

910
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
and Death Trap is an ultimate ability,

911
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
so as soon as I pop it,

912
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
you'll see Urvar's Bombs kind of shoot out,

913
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and you get that lower cooldown effect as well,

914
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,000
so it's great.

915
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And you get two Death Traps.

916
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I wonder how he's doing that.

917
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
That's on me.

918
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,000
That's on me, guys.

919
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah.

920
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
All the teasing on this stream.

921
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And finally, before they play the walk-off music,

922
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I think I could showcase...

923
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Let's do Gregor's Lightning Square.

924
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So if you notice,

925
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Lilith's skill had like a slight cooldown.

926
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
This one scales with your build really well,

927
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
so the more you can cast core skills,

928
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
the more you get these iconic kind of lightning strike panels

929
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
shoot out from your character,

930
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
so you can imagine you can just go full Thunder God here

931
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
the whole time with your builds.

932
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So, yeah, I think that's all I can showcase today,

933
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
but I appreciate the time.

934
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
No, thank you.

935
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
That was awesome.

936
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yeah, so again,

937
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
those are just like kind of a sneak peek

938
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
at just a handful of the powers.

939
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Again, throughout the course of the PTR,

940
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
you'll get to experiment and engage with all of them,

941
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
and again, looking forward to the feedback

942
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and just general notes

943
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
of how you incorporate into your builds

944
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
and what really excites you.

945
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So I think that's pretty much the wrap-up

946
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
for all the content coming in Season 8

947
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
that persists beyond and within.

948
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yeah, all the Season 8 stuff

949
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
that will be available in PTR

950
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
for players to actually jump into.

951
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
We're still going to be talking about

952
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
a few more things

953
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
as we get closer to Season 8

954
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
with the launch of the actual season itself.

955
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So, Derek, thank you so much

956
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
for walking us through everything.

957
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And of course, with a new Season

958
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and a new PTR,

959
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
we have a lot of changes

960
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
that are coming to classes,

961
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
specifically like the Rogue,

962
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
which...

963
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
We saw so many things in those.

964
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
We'll just skip the Rogue.

965
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
There's other classes to talk about.

966
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah, so Charles over here

967
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
is actually going to go through

968
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,000
all the class changes

969
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
that players will be able to experience

970
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
and test out during the PTR.

971
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah, of course.

972
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I mean, there's tons of new bosses to fight,

973
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
so how are you going to fight them?

974
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So let's talk about some class updates

975
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
that are coming.

976
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
First, I want to talk about some updates

977
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
that are going to affect all classes

978
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
in some way.

979
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
These are kind of a bit more generic updates.

980
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So talking about ultimate scaling,

981
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
this is something that we introduced

982
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
in Season 7,

983
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,000
the current live season,

984
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
where as you get to rank 5

985
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
of the ultimate skills,

986
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
some of them had mechanics

987
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
that allowed you to crank up their damage

988
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
by building different stats, right?

989
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So if you got more damage while fortified,

990
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
then your blood wave

991
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
is going to do more damage, for instance.

992
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We think that's really cool.

993
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It enabled a lot of very powerful builds.

994
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
A lot of very powerful builds.

995
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And so we're looking at ensuring

996
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
that those don't really eclipse

997
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
every other option in the game.

998
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
We still love that those are powerful builds.

999
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
We love that you're playing them.

1000
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
We don't want them to be the only option.

1001
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And so with that in mind,

1002
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
we're looking at putting a cap on that scaling.

1003
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You can scale them up to 200% bonus damage,

1004
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
which is still a lot.

1005
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
You're still doing triple damage.

1006
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
But we just want to make sure

1007
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
it doesn't get completely out of control

1008
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
with all the new stats

1009
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
and some of the scaling coming in

1010
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
from some of the seasonal powers

1011
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
that could potentially lead those to be,

1012
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
you know, crowding out other options of gameplay.

1013
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Additionally, we're looking at crowd control.

1014
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
This is something I talked about

1015
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
on our last Campfire Chat

1016
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
about how we're really looking

1017
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
at the moment-to-moment combat of our game.

1018
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You know, like, what are you doing, like,

1019
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
like, one second to the next?

1020
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And one thing that came up a lot was

1021
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
sometimes enemies just randomly get crowd controlled.

1022
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
They randomly are frozen or stunned.

1023
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And a lot of this comes from some of the,

1024
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
what we call incidental crowd control,

1025
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
as in lucky hit crowd control effects

1026
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
or anything that involves not like,

1027
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
oh, I pressed a button, now they're stunned, right?

1028
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
And we noticed, like, hey,

1029
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
we got a lot of these effects across the game

1030
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
in many different places.

1031
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And so we looked at really toning those down,

1032
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
specifically in the generic spaces.

1033
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I know Fist of Fate is one of,

1034
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
a very popular unique item right now

1035
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
for many reasons.

1036
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
One of them was that,

1037
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
that kind of free crowd control.

1038
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But that's something that we think

1039
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
wasn't really promoting the best

1040
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
moment-to-moment combat

1041
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and most engaging flow.

1042
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So that particular affix has been changed

1043
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
to lucky hit apply vulnerable.

1044
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But a lot of the other identity of Fist of Fate

1045
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
is still there as well.

1046
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
So it still has, you know,

1047
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
wide ranges on things.

1048
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It still does random damage

1049
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and a lot of lucky hit chance as well.

1050
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Yeah, and this change really

1051
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
puts the value of Frost Nova

1052
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and Ground Stomp

1053
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and it sort of makes those

1054
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
more valuable and satisfying.

1055
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Right, yeah.

1056
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
So if you really want to get

1057
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
those kind of crowd control effects,

1058
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
like, it's going to be

1059
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
a build choice.

1060
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
You're going to have to

1061
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
consciously do it

1062
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
and you're going to, like,

1063
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
know when it's happening.

1064
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,000
It's not just,

1065
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
oh, they randomly got stunned

1066
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
and, you know,

1067
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
if they didn't get stunned,

1068
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
maybe you got hit.

1069
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And that never felt good

1070
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
when it was just kind of purely random.

1071
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Yeah.

1072
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Yeah.

1073
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Additionally, this is something

1074
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
that the keen-eyed among you

1075
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,000
might have spied

1076
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
when we were looking

1077
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
at some other stuff.

1078
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
We've done a bit of a naming pass

1079
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
on some of the damage over time effects.

1080
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
This is no functional change.

1081
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
This is just a naming thing

1082
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
where we have things like

1083
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
physical damage

1084
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and when it's physical damage

1085
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
over time,

1086
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,000
we call it bleeding.

1087
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And when it's poison,

1088
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
we call it poisoning,

1089
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
for instance.

1090
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
We didn't previously have names

1091
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
for shadow, lightning,

1092
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
or cold damage over time.

1093
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
We would just call it, like,

1094
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
from shadow damage over time

1095
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
affected enemies,

1096
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
which was an absolute mouthful.

1097
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So we've got new common terms.

1098
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Shadow damage over time

1099
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
will be called corrupting damage.

1100
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Lightning damage over time

1101
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
is shocking damage.

1102
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And cold damage over time,

1103
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
which we saw with

1104
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
the wandering death chest beam,

1105
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
is called frostbite damage.

1106
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So that's just a terminology thing.

1107
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
It still relates

1108
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
to those base damage types,

1109
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
same as always.

1110
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It's just a terminology update.

1111
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Cleans up the tooltips.

1112
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Absolutely, yeah.

1113
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Alright, so let's get on

1114
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
to some of the actual

1115
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
class updates,

1116
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
starting, oh,

1117
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
we'll just go alphabetically

1118
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
with the Barbarian.

1119
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Alright, so our focus

1120
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
on Barbarian this season

1121
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
is about,

1122
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,000
primarily about

1123
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Barbarian's core fantasy

1124
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
of being physical

1125
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,000
and hitting enemies

1126
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
with a big weapon, right?

1127
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
In the past couple seasons,

1128
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
a lot of the meta builds

1129
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
around Barbarian

1130
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
have focused around

1131
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
things like earthquakes

1132
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
or dust devils,

1133
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
which are really cool

1134
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
and fun,

1135
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
but I think they,

1136
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
we got some feedback

1137
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that, hey,

1138
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I don't really feel like

1139
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm hitting enemies

1140
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
with my big weapon,

1141
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I'm just making

1142
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
a tornado that hits them,

1143
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
which is not maybe

1144
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
fulfilling the fantasy

1145
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
that you want

1146
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,000
out of a Barbarian.

1147
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Your core skill

1148
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
isn't the cool thing,

1149
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
it's the thing

1150
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
that the core skill spawns.

1151
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Right, right.

1152
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And that's,

1153
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
it's cool that those exist,

1154
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
but we want to make sure

1155
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
we're also catering

1156
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
to that, you know,

1157
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
heavy hitter

1158
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
kind of fantasy.

1159
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And so a lot of the updates

1160
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
this season are focused

1161
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,000
around that,

1162
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
specifically updates

1163
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
to double swing core skill

1164
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
and the twin strikes unique

1165
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
to make that a bit more impactful

1166
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
to actually be hitting.

1167
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Whirlwind as well,

1168
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
that's getting a buff

1169
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and a rework

1170
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
with Gore's,

1171
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
its unique Gore's

1172
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
devastating grips.

1173
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And then the new unique

1174
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
and legendary this season

1175
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
really talk to Mighty Throw

1176
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,000
in particular

1177
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and make that just like

1178
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
the biggest hitting thing.

1179
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Let's take a look

1180
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
at those uniques

1181
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and the unique

1182
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and legendary here.

1183
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So we've got the Bane

1184
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,000
of Aja Den.

1185
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
This is a unique glove item.

1186
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And it says that

1187
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
every 12 seconds

1188
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
your next Mighty Throw

1189
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
is going to detonate

1190
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
all of its pulses instantly.

1191
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You know,

1192
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,000
normally Mighty Throw

1193
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
like pulses over time.

1194
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It's going to do them

1195
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,000
all at once

1196
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and deal massively

1197
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
increased damage.

1198
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And that's going to

1199
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
pair up very well

1200
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,000
with the new legendary

1201
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
aspect of delayed extinction,

1202
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
which causes both Mighty Throw

1203
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and Steel Grasp

1204
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
to gain multiplicative

1205
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,000
bonus damage

1206
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
rather than cooldown

1207
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
from cooldown reduction.

1208
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
So if you've got

1209
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,000
cooldown reduction

1210
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
on your gear

1211
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
or on the Bane

1212
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
of Aja Den,

1213
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,000
for instance,

1214
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
that's not going

1215
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
to actually reduce

1216
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,000
the cooldown.

1217
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's going to be

1218
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
a multiplicative scaler

1219
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
for these skills.

1220
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So now you've got

1221
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
a new problem to solve,

1222
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000
right?

1223
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
You can't cast

1224
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
these skills quite as often,

1225
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,000
but when you do,

1226
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,000
they're going to hit

1227
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
super hard.

1228
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And so we've got

1229
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
a video clip of it

1230
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
just deleting a screen.

1231
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,000
So you walk up

1232
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
and they're all got.

1233
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,000
One hit,

1234
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
that's all it takes

1235
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
because you've got

1236
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
all these multipliers

1237
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
on your one big hit.

1238
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,000
But of course,

1239
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
because it doesn't

1240
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
benefit from cooldown reduction,

1241
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,000
that cooldown is going

1242
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
to be pretty much

1243
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
locked at that 12 second mark.

1244
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
And so you're going

1245
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,000
to have to find

1246
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
some other way

1247
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
to kind of fill the gap

1248
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,000
in there

1249
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and you've got

1250
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
a new challenge

1251
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
for your build to overcome.

1252
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I'm hoping to see

1253
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
like Belial get decked

1254
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,000
by this.

1255
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I think it is possible

1256
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
that you're going to

1257
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
melt some bosses

1258
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
with some really big hits.

1259
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
It's a great finishing move.

1260
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Oh yeah.

1261
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
All right,

1262
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
let's take a look

1263
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,000
at the Druid.

1264
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
So for the Druid,

1265
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I want to talk

1266
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
a little bit about

1267
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
one of the meta builds

1268
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
right now

1269
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
is revolts around Cataclysm

1270
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
and kind of

1271
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
snapshotting issues

1272
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
that come up with that.

1273
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And so for those

1274
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
of you who don't know

1275
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
what snapshotting

1276
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
basically means

1277
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
is for Cataclysm,

1278
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,000
which is one of their

1279
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
ultimate skills

1280
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
that has a duration.

1281
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So you press the button,

1282
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
it summons a storm

1283
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
around you that lasts

1284
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
for some amount of time.

1285
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And if you get a lot

1286
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
of that cooldown reduction

1287
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
and you can cast Cataclysm

1288
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
a second time

1289
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
before the first one expires,

1290
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
currently on the live game,

1291
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
the second cast of Cataclysm

1292
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
will keep all of the bonuses

1293
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and like bonus damage effects

1294
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
or guaranteed overpowers

1295
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,000
or whatever

1296
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
that was affecting

1297
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
the first one.

1298
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And that was definitely

1299
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,000
not intended.

1300
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,000
That is not how

1301
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
we wanted that to work.

1302
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
We didn't want bonuses

1303
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
from one cast

1304
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
kind of instance

1305
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
to carry over

1306
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
to the next cast.

1307
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Now this can only happen

1308
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
in situations

1309
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
where you get

1310
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
that lot of cooldown,

1311
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
but it was kind of

1312
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
promoting this gameplay

1313
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
where it's very

1314
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
feast or famine.

1315
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
If you successfully

1316
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
kind of snapshot

1317
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
all the buffs,

1318
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
this build is insanely powerful.

1319
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And if you mess it up

1320
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
or you don't get

1321
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
the snapshot quite right,

1322
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
you're actually really weak.

1323
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And that led to

1324
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
unintuitive gameplay

1325
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
and this really

1326
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
big divide

1327
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
between the best

1328
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and the optimal

1329
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and like kind of

1330
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
the average normal case scenario.

1331
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So we're addressing that

1332
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,000
where we don't really

1333
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
want to promote that

1334
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
between two different

1335
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
cast snapshotting.

1336
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Yeah, we don't like

1337
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
snapshotting in general.

1338
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Right, yeah.

1339
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
The kind of snapshotting

1340
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
where you are

1341
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
persisting things

1342
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
between different

1343
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
cast instances

1344
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
or equipping gear

1345
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and then unequipping it

1346
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
to maintain a bonus.

1347
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Those are snapshotting things

1348
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
that we don't think

1349
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
promotes healthy gameplay.

1350
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
It's unintuitive

1351
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,000
in a lot of cases.

1352
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You need to read a guide

1353
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and follow an exact checklist

1354
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
to do it.

1355
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
That's not something

1356
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
that we think

1357
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
is good for the game.

1358
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
There are some cases

1359
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
where, you know,

1360
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
with Cataclysm,

1361
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000
you know,

1362
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
giving the bonus

1363
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
to that whole

1364
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
that first time

1365
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,000
you cast it,

1366
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,000
that it,

1367
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,000
you might say

1368
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
it's kind of snapshots

1369
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
for the duration

1370
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,000
of Cataclysm,

1371
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
but that's intended

1372
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
where it says

1373
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
your next cast

1374
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,000
does something.

1375
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
That's what we want,

1376
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,000
but we don't want

1377
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
that to persist on

1378
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
to multiple casts

1379
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
or through

1380
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
basically infinitely.

1381
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So that's one thing

1382
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
that we're adjusting

1383
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,000
on Druid,

1384
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
but we're also looking

1385
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
at promoting

1386
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
other play styles

1387
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,000
as well.

1388
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
We think that build

1389
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,000
is fun,

1390
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
but there's other ways

1391
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
to play Druid as well.

1392
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Specifically with Stoneburst,

1393
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
that's the Earth Core skill,

1394
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
it was kind of

1395
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000
a channeled skill,

1396
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
which from a lot

1397
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
of our channeled skills,

1398
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
they are not allowed

1399
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
to overpower,

1400
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
but with Stoneburst

1401
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
particularly,

1402
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,000
we have reworked

1403
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
one of its legendary items

1404
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
to allow it to overpower

1405
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
when you detonate it

1406
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
at maximum size,

1407
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,000
which is really cool

1408
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
and opens up

1409
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
some new build possibilities

1410
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
for Stoneburst.

1411
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And finally,

1412
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I want to talk about

1413
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
the new unique

1414
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Gathlin's Birthright.

1415
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
This is a,

1416
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
let's take a look

1417
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
at it on screen here.

1418
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It's in a similar vein

1419
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
to Tempest Roar

1420
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
and Vassilius Prayer,

1421
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
where it is a unique helm

1422
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
that is very transformational,

1423
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
but rather than talking

1424
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
to werewolves

1425
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
or werebear builds,

1426
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
it's talking to

1427
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,000
human form builds.

1428
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
If you just,

1429
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
you don't want to,

1430
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
you don't want to embrace

1431
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the wilds quite as much,

1432
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
you want to stay

1433
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
in your human form,

1434
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Gathlin's Birthright

1435
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,000
is going to be

1436
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
the unique helm for you.

1437
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,000
It says,

1438
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
while you're in human form,

1439
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
critically striking enemies

1440
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
with your nature magic skills

1441
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,000
will grant you

1442
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Anima of the Forest

1443
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,000
for 10 seconds.

1444
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And when you get,

1445
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
whenever you gain

1446
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Anima of the Forest,

1447
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
you are infused

1448
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
with bonus key passives,

1449
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Perfect Storm

1450
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
and Earthenmite.

1451
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
So if you have this

1452
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,000
and you have

1453
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
another key passive,

1454
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
you can potentially

1455
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
have up to three

1456
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
key passives active

1457
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,000
at once,

1458
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,000
which is not something

1459
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
we've ever done before

1460
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
in Diablo 4.

1461
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
That's nutty.

1462
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And I love that

1463
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
it's on the helm,

1464
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
so if you really want

1465
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,000
to be a human druid,

1466
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
which historically,

1467
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,000
you know,

1468
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
hasn't been as great

1469
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
as a werewolf,

1470
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
for example,

1471
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
this is the helm for you.

1472
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Yeah,

1473
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
this is exactly,

1474
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
exactly that.

1475
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It's in a similar spot

1476
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
as like,

1477
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
hey,

1478
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
this is build defining

1479
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
in the way that

1480
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Tempest Roar is

1481
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,000
for werewolves.

1482
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,000
We want this to be

1483
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
the build defining helm

1484
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
for human form druids.

1485
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Additionally,

1486
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
aspect of impending deluge

1487
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
that empowers your storm strike,

1488
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,000
which is probably

1489
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
pretty useful

1490
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
with this human form

1491
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
nature magic build,

1492
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
which will cause

1493
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,000
your storm strike

1494
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
to deal more

1495
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
and also increase damage

1496
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
that they take

1497
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
from your other skills

1498
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,000
for a time.

1499
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I think we've got

1500
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
a picture of this,

1501
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
or a video of this

1502
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,000
in action,

1503
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
where you've got

1504
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
your druid,

1505
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,000
it's got your,

1506
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
you need 200 stacks

1507
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
of Anima of the Force,

1508
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
which sounds like a lot,

1509
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
but it triggers on every hit,

1510
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
so in most combat situations,

1511
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
you actually stack it up

1512
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
pretty quick,

1513
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
and see,

1514
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
once you get this online,

1515
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
you're going to be empowered

1516
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
with Earth and Might

1517
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
and with Perfect Storm

1518
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
and with Nature's Fury.

1519
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You have all of this power.

1520
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And the idea of three passes

1521
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,000
going at once,

1522
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
the key passes is crazy.

1523
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yeah.

1524
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And the boss power

1525
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
slapped on top of that, too.

1526
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Oh, yeah.

1527
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It is a lot

1528
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
when you get this empowered state.

1529
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,000
All right,

1530
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
moving on to

1531
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
one of my favorite classes,

1532
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
the Necromancer.

1533
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So,

1534
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Necromancer was probably

1535
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
the talk of the current season,

1536
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Season 7,

1537
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
with Bloodwave.

1538
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I know we've mentioned it

1539
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,000
a few times on stream.

1540
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Bloodwave,

1541
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
really good.

1542
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
We've talked about

1543
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
how we're going to look

1544
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
at ultimate scaling,

1545
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
so maybe it won't scale up

1546
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
with the bonus damage,

1547
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
at least not to the

1548
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
same level

1549
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that it had before.

1550
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
We're going to put a cap on that.

1551
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
We also just think

1552
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
we generally overshot the mark

1553
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
on the unique item,

1554
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
the Kissimmee's Legacy,

1555
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
which really, like,

1556
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
you get this item

1557
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
and suddenly you're a god.

1558
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It just had

1559
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
so much power

1560
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
in one spot.

1561
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And we like a bit more

1562
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
of that progression

1563
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
that Colin

1564
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
was alluding to before

1565
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,000
about that

1566
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
zero-to-hero journey.

1567
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And when you have one item

1568
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,000
that is,

1569
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,000
you equip it

1570
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
and it's over.

1571
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Like,

1572
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
you're as powerful

1573
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
as you ever need to be.

1574
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,000
That really shortcuts

1575
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
that journey

1576
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
and really makes it feel

1577
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
less satisfying

1578
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,000
than we want.

1579
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So we're taking a look

1580
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
at reducing the power

1581
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
of that unique in particular,

1582
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:37,000
as well as some other

1583
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
adjustments to Bloodwave.

1584
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
We do want Bloodwave

1585
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
builds to still be powerful

1586
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
and still be an option

1587
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
if you like that playstyle.

1588
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
We just don't want it

1589
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
to be the S++ tier

1590
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
that it was in the past.

1591
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Additionally,

1592
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,000
we're taking a look

1593
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
at Bloodlance.

1594
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
This is a core skill

1595
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
that has historically

1596
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
been very good

1597
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
in multi-target

1598
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
kind of clearing out

1599
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
pit runs

1600
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
or dungeon situations.

1601
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
But then you run up

1602
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,000
into a boss,

1603
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,000
which, hey,

1604
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
we're fighting a lot

1605
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,000
of bosses this season.

1606
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yeah, we'll be.

1607
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
And it suddenly falls

1608
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
really flat

1609
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
because its core mechanic

1610
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
is about, like,

1611
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
arcing damage

1612
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
between enemies

1613
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
and if there's only

1614
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,000
one enemy,

1615
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
what are you doing here?

1616
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Right?

1617
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So with this update

1618
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
to Bloodlance,

1619
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
it's going to still

1620
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
maintain some of that fantasy

1621
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
where it arcs

1622
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
the damage between enemies,

1623
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
but if you're hitting

1624
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
a target who's already lanced,

1625
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,000
it's going to do

1626
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
a massive amount

1627
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,000
more damage.

1628
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So it's much better

1629
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,000
in single-target situations

1630
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
and much more viable

1631
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,000
for bossing.

1632
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
And finally,

1633
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
the new legendary

1634
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
and unique for this season

1635
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
talks to minions.

1636
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So let's take a look

1637
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
at Sanguivar,

1638
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Blade of Zir,

1639
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
the unique

1640
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
two-handed sword.

1641
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So this weapon

1642
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
will empower

1643
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
your summons,

1644
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
so your minions

1645
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
and your army of the dead,

1646
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
to affect enemies

1647
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
with Vampiric Curse.

1648
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Now, for those of you

1649
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
played back in Season 2,

1650
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Vampiric Curse

1651
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
was a mechanic

1652
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,000
that we introduced

1653
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
in Season of Blood

1654
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
where you affect enemies

1655
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
with it,

1656
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
and as you kill them,

1657
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,000
you kind of collect

1658
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
their soul.

1659
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,000
And then you can

1660
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
unleash these souls.

1661
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
They kind of run out

1662
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
from you and explode

1663
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,000
in this really

1664
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
satisfying moment.

1665
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And we put that on

1666
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,000
a handful of

1667
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
legendary aspects,

1668
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
but now all of your

1669
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,000
summons will affect

1670
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
enemies with Vampiric Curse.

1671
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
And you can unleash them

1672
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
with Army of the Dead.

1673
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And when you do that,

1674
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
the souls from

1675
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Vampiric Curse

1676
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
and Army of the Dead

1677
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
itself will deal

1678
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
massively increased damage,

1679
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
scaling with how many

1680
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
souls you've collected.

1681
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It's huge.

1682
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I love Minion Necro.

1683
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It's like my favorite one.

1684
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Oh, yeah.

1685
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Yeah, this is really cool

1686
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
for Army of the Dead

1687
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
and Minion Necro

1688
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
to just really be

1689
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
that impactful moment

1690
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
of summoning

1691
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
an army of skeletons

1692
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
to just eviscerate

1693
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
the enemies.

1694
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And additionally,

1695
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
aspect of service

1696
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
and sacrifice,

1697
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I love playing

1698
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
with this one.

1699
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,000
This one feels

1700
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
so good to play.

1701
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Your skeleton warriors

1702
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
explode on death,

1703
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
dealing a massive chunk

1704
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
of physical damage

1705
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
to surrounding enemies.

1706
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And to help make sure

1707
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
they die,

1708
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
they lose 25% life

1709
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
per second while in combat.

1710
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
So you're going to be

1711
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
needing to resummon

1712
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
them quite often,

1713
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
but when you do,

1714
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,000
hey, it's good

1715
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
because they're going

1716
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
to be detonating

1717
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
for this massive chunk

1718
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
at the end.

1719
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And additionally,

1720
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
while you're resummoning

1721
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,000
all your warriors,

1722
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
your mages are going

1723
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
to be super tanky.

1724
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
They're going to take

1725
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
90% less damage

1726
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
and deal massively

1727
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
increased damage.

1728
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,000
So you're going

1729
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
to have your mages

1730
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,000
up pretty much

1731
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
all the time

1732
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,000
and you're going

1733
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
to be focusing

1734
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
on resummoning

1735
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,000
the warriors

1736
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
to run in there

1737
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and explode

1738
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
and do their damage

1739
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
that way.

1740
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
That's awesome.

1741
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,000
It's a really clever way

1742
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
to make it feel

1743
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
like you're constantly

1744
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,000
summoning

1745
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
and you have your

1746
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
back line of mages

1747
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,000
just obliterating.

1748
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Yeah, it's great.

1749
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Let's take a look

1750
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
at Sanguivar Blade of Zier

1751
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
in action here.

1752
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Oh no, sorry,

1753
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
this is actually

1754
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
service and sacrifice.

1755
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So you've got

1756
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
your skeleton warriors,

1757
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
the skirmishers,

1758
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,000
they run up there

1759
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
and then here's

1760
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Blade of Zier, right?

1761
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
You get all those

1762
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
like skeleton warriors

1763
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,000
running out

1764
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
when you activate

1765
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Army of the Dead.

1766
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
You just get the

1767
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
normal ones

1768
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
that are running around

1769
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
but then they all

1770
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
you unleash

1771
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
a stream of them

1772
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
straight from you

1773
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
with the

1774
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Sanguivar.

1775
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Really impactful

1776
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
ultimate skill there.

1777
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Yeah, Army of the Dead

1778
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
is just so underutilized

1779
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
so I'm so happy

1780
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
to see it come back

1781
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,000
into the fold.

1782
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
It's great.

1783
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,000
All right,

1784
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
next up we've got

1785
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,000
the one we've been

1786
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
teasing for a bit.

1787
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Thank you, Ruben.

1788
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
The Rogue.

1789
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Let's take a look

1790
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
at the idea with Rogue.

1791
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
So as you probably guessed,

1792
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
the theme of Rogue

1793
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
this season

1794
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
is looking at

1795
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Trap builds,

1796
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,000
right,

1797
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,000
with both

1798
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Death Trap

1799
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
and Poison Trap

1800
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,000
in a way.

1801
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Historically,

1802
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Poison Trap

1803
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
has been kind of

1804
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
underrepresented.

1805
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Death Trap builds

1806
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
have been quite popular,

1807
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
pretty powerful

1808
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
and a lot of fun

1809
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
to play.

1810
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Poison Trap

1811
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
kind of fell

1812
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
by the wayside

1813
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,000
a little bit.

1814
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It had a number

1815
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:39,000
of issues

1816
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
that we're looking

1817
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
to address this season

1818
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
to really promote

1819
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Poison Trap

1820
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
as a viable

1821
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:44,000
standalone build.

1822
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
And what we're seeing

1823
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
from Ruben

1824
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
was the Scoundrel's

1825
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Leather rework.

1826
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Now this is a unique

1827
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
chest item

1828
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,000
that's been in the game

1829
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
for a while.

1830
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It was about traps

1831
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,000
in the past.

1832
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,000
We've done a rework

1833
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
this season

1834
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
where when you cast

1835
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,000
a trap,

1836
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
or rather every 10 seconds

1837
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
when you cast the trap,

1838
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,000
you're going to get

1839
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
a bonus Death Trap.

1840
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So you could cast

1841
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Poison Trap

1842
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
or Caltrops

1843
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
or Death Trap itself

1844
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and then you get

1845
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
a second Death Trap.

1846
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
And when you actually

1847
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
cast the Death Trap

1848
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
active button,

1849
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,000
you're going to

1850
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
kind of jump

1851
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
or teleport

1852
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
to that position

1853
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:18,000
so you can just

1854
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
instantly get

1855
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
into the fray there.

1856
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Oh, that's cool.

1857
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Yeah, so rogues

1858
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
are all about mobility

1859
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,000
and jumping around

1860
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
the battlefield

1861
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and doing that

1862
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,000
kind of thing.

1863
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:28,000
This is just another

1864
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
tool in their arsenal

1865
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
to really jump in,

1866
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
put the Death Trap

1867
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,000
down,

1868
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
which groups up

1869
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,000
some enemies

1870
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
and then they're

1871
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
ready for you

1872
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,000
to slaughter there.

1873
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
But let's take a look

1874
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,000
at the new items

1875
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
that talk to

1876
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Poison Trap

1877
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,000
specifically.

1878
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
The Bands of Icarus Rose,

1879
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
these are unique gloves

1880
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
that says your Poison Trap,

1881
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
which normally has

1882
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
a 9 second duration,

1883
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
it's always going to do

1884
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
its full damage

1885
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
over 3 seconds instead.

1886
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So it's much shorter duration

1887
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
but higher DPS.

1888
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And it's always going to

1889
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,000
benefit from all

1890
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
of its upgrades.

1891
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,000
You know,

1892
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
that enhancement

1893
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
and those modifications,

1894
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
you just get all of them.

1895
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,000
You don't need to put

1896
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
skill points in

1897
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and normally

1898
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
the two choices

1899
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
are mutually exclusive.

1900
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,000
You get both

1901
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
with these

1902
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
and they're going to

1903
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
be even more powerful.

1904
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Additionally,

1905
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Poison Trap

1906
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
will now also

1907
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
benefit from your

1908
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
combo points

1909
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,000
if you're using those.

1910
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:15,000
It's going to have

1911
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
no cooldown

1912
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
during the Inner Sight

1913
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
if you're using Inner Sight

1914
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
and if you're using

1915
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Preparation,

1916
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,000
its cooldown

1917
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
is going to be reduced

1918
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
by the Preparation Trigger.

1919
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,000
So previously,

1920
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Poison Trap

1921
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
didn't really interact

1922
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
with any of these

1923
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
three mechanics very well

1924
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
and now it benefits

1925
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
from whichever one you want.

1926
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
That's so cool.

1927
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
So it really makes it

1928
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
more like a core skill,

1929
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,000
something I can work

1930
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
into my rotation.

1931
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Oh yeah.

1932
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Yeah, you're going to

1933
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
be wanting to use this

1934
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,000
very often

1935
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
with this unique.

1936
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And then the aspect

1937
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,000
of Contamination,

1938
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
as many builds

1939
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
that focus around

1940
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Poison on Rogue

1941
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
often want to build

1942
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Critical Strike Damage

1943
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
because that's really good

1944
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
with the Poison Imbuement,

1945
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Poison Trap

1946
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
now also can scale up

1947
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
with some Critical Strike Chance.

1948
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
So with Aspect of Contamination,

1949
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
it unleashes a Poison Burst

1950
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
when it detonates,

1951
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,000
like kind of initial

1952
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
upfront hit.

1953
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And then if that Burst

1954
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
critically strikes,

1955
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
which, you know,

1956
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
if you're building

1957
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
a lot of Crit Chance,

1958
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
it probably will,

1959
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
or if you hit a lot of enemies,

1960
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
then you're going to deal

1961
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
increased Poison Damage

1962
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
for a duration,

1963
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
which will of course

1964
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
increase the rest

1965
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
of the duration

1966
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,000
of the Poison Trap.

1967
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And this is probably

1968
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
my favorite clip here.

1969
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Let's get a clip

1970
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,000
of this one.

1971
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Right?

1972
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
So you apply Poison Trap,

1973
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
which it's going

1974
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
to throw two of them out.

1975
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
And one of its upgrades

1976
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
knocks down enemies.

1977
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And because it's increased,

1978
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
it knocks them down

1979
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
for quite a while.

1980
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And so they just

1981
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
take a little nap

1982
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
in your Poison Traps.

1983
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I don't recommend it,

1984
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,000
but hey,

1985
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
if they do,

1986
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
they take a ton

1987
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
of Poison Damage.

1988
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I love the knockdown animation

1989
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
of this guy's enemy.

1990
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Yeah.

1991
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
This guy just falls right down.

1992
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Just sit down.

1993
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Lay down, I guess.

1994
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
His face is in it.

1995
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
His face plants

1996
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
and then succumbs

1997
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
to the Poison.

1998
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It's awesome.

1999
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
All right.

2000
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Moving on,

2001
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
we've got our Sorceress.

2002
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So the Sorceress class

2003
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
definitely is one

2004
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
of the ones

2005
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
currently on Season 7

2006
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
that I think

2007
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
didn't have

2008
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
any of these

2009
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
real big outlier builds

2010
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,000
that we'd kind of

2011
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
talked about.

2012
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Some of the highest highs

2013
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,000
come from like

2014
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
the Blood Necro

2015
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
or the Druid

2016
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
with the snapshotting

2017
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Cataclysm.

2018
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And I think

2019
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I definitely want

2020
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
to acknowledge

2021
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
that Sorceress

2022
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
maybe didn't have

2023
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,000
some of those

2024
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
real outliers

2025
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
this season

2026
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,000
and they were

2027
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
maybe felt like

2028
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
they were a bit behind

2029
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
of those.

2030
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
So as we talked about

2031
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
with other classes,

2032
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
we're definitely looking

2033
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
at bringing those

2034
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
outlier builds

2035
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
down a notch

2036
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
to bring them

2037
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
kind of back

2038
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
to the norm

2039
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
of some of the

2040
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
other builds

2041
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,000
so they're not

2042
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
so far ahead.

2043
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But for Sorceress,

2044
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:43,000
we're looking at

2045
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
improving some of

2046
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
the quality of life

2047
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
and some of the

2048
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
interactions between

2049
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
some of their mechanics

2050
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
like Crackling Energy,

2051
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Meteors and Meteorites

2052
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and making sure

2053
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
they scale well

2054
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,000
with the build.

2055
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Like Crackling Energy

2056
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
will now have

2057
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
the Shock skill tag

2058
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
so if you're building up

2059
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
damage for Shock skills

2060
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
or some of the other

2061
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
synergies there,

2062
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
those now interact

2063
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
with your Crackling Energy

2064
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
and additionally

2065
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
with Meteor and Meteorites

2066
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
they're not going to be able

2067
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
to scale with each other's

2068
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
damage which helps

2069
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
builds just be a bit

2070
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
more cohesive

2071
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
and feel more

2072
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
robustly supported.

2073
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That being said,

2074
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I think where Sorceress

2075
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
has been in Season 7

2076
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
is in terms of

2077
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
like its power progression

2078
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
and the relative strength

2079
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
of its builds

2080
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
amongst each other

2081
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
is more of the

2082
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
closer to the ideal state

2083
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
of where we envision

2084
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
all classes ending up.

2085
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
We recognize that

2086
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
they are kind of

2087
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
a bit lower

2088
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
than other classes

2089
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
in Season 7

2090
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
but we're looking at

2091
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
bringing them up

2092
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,000
a little bit

2093
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
with improved quality of life

2094
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
and build options

2095
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
and making sure

2096
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
that some of the

2097
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,000
outlier builds

2098
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
that's really skewing

2099
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
that perception

2100
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
are being brought

2101
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,000
to be

2102
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
to

2103
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
bring them close together

2104
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
and create some more

2105
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
harmony between the classes.

2106
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Exactly.

2107
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Yeah.

2108
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Yeah.

2109
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And I think this is something

2110
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
that we're actively looking at

2111
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
again to the point

2112
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
of early in the season

2113
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
if things aren't really

2114
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
performing to

2115
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
the level of our expectation

2116
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
and it doesn't feel good

2117
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
then those are things

2118
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
that we're going to buff

2119
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
and Sorceress is a great example

2120
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
of like what we're going

2121
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
to be really looking at.

2122
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah.

2123
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Yeah.

2124
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And we want to do that

2125
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
in ways that make

2126
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
we don't just want to slap

2127
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
on a 50x scaler

2128
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,000
on Sorceress

2129
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
we want to make sure

2130
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
that the builds feel

2131
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
cohesive and coherent

2132
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
in a way that makes

2133
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,000
a lot of sense.

2134
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And so that's what

2135
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
all the bulk of our focus

2136
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,000
is for Sorc

2137
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
this season.

2138
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Specifically

2139
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I want to talk a little bit

2140
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
about Ice Shards

2141
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
that's what

2142
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
the new Unique

2143
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
is going to be

2144
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
working with here.

2145
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Let's take a look

2146
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
at the Unique

2147
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
The Hail of Virglass.

2148
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
This is a Unique Helm

2149
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
that's going to empower

2150
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
your Ice Shards

2151
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
to spread out

2152
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
rather than shoot

2153
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
in kind of a straight line

2154
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
that kind of rapid fire.

2155
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's now going to be

2156
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
a spread pattern.

2157
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
You can hit more enemies

2158
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,000
with it

2159
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
and you get bonus shards

2160
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
and you're going to be

2161
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
dealing increased damage

2162
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
for every time

2163
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
an Ice Shard's

2164
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
damages an enemy

2165
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
and it's going to stack up.

2166
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
So it takes a lot of stacks

2167
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:03,000
you need to be

2168
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
spamming Ice Shards

2169
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
you need to be hitting a lot

2170
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
but once you do

2171
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
it unleashes a lot

2172
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
of bonus damage.

2173
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And also

2174
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
it just makes the skill

2175
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
in my opinion

2176
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:13,000
a lot more usable.

2177
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I like the spread pattern

2178
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
a whole lot

2179
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
unless you hit

2180
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
wider screen

2181
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and you can kind of

2182
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
like shotgun enemies

2183
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,000
if you get nice

2184
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
and close to them.

2185
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
That's cool.

2186
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And Shivering Aspect

2187
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
a new legendary aspect here

2188
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
enemies are going to

2189
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:27,000
take increased damage

2190
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
based on how much

2191
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
they're chilled

2192
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
or staggering.

2193
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Now historically

2194
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
some of the Frost Sorcs

2195
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
or some of the other

2196
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
builds that were heavy

2197
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
on those crowd control effects

2198
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
sometimes they really

2199
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
struggled into bosses

2200
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
which hey

2201
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
bosses are the theme

2202
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,000
of the season.

2203
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's very appropriate.

2204
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So we're making sure

2205
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
that some of these

2206
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,000
new effects

2207
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
that scale based

2208
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
on the crowd control effects

2209
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
also work against bosses.

2210
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So this will

2211
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
kind of

2212
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
take how much stagger

2213
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:53,000
you've built up

2214
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:53,000
on the boss

2215
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and also give you

2216
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
a bonus damage

2217
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,000
based on that.

2218
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
So really being cognizant

2219
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,000
of hey let's make sure

2220
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
this works

2221
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
in the situations

2222
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,000
you want it to

2223
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
and it's not

2224
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
night and day

2225
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
oh I'm clearing

2226
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,000
trash mobs

2227
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and then I hit the boss

2228
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
and you just feel

2229
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,000
so different.

2230
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:07,000
We want to make sure

2231
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
that's a bit smoother

2232
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
of an experience

2233
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
between the two

2234
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
ways of playing.

2235
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Alright let's take a look

2236
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
at the hail of virglass

2237
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,000
with these new

2238
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
ice shards in action.

2239
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Right so they

2240
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
fire out pretty quick

2241
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
they fire out

2242
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
in a nice spread

2243
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
and you can clear

2244
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
through whole packs

2245
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
of skeletons

2246
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
with a single cast here.

2247
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Multi shot.

2248
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Oh yeah.

2249
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Multi shot with ice shards.

2250
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Oh yeah.

2251
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Alright and moving on

2252
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
to our final class here

2253
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
the spirit born.

2254
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
So the spirit born

2255
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
was in a pretty good state

2256
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I mean similar to

2257
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
to sorceress

2258
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,000
where it didn't have

2259
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
those crazy

2260
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
overpowered builds

2261
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
but we think it's

2262
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
in a relatively

2263
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
healthy spot

2264
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
and we're just

2265
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
looking at empowering

2266
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
new build options

2267
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
and making tighter

2268
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
synergies between the

2269
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
builds and giving you

2270
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
some new tools

2271
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
to play with.

2272
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
With that in mind

2273
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,000
we took a look

2274
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
at rushing claw.

2275
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
It's one of my

2276
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,000
favorite skills

2277
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
on the spirit born

2278
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
but never really

2279
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,000
found its way

2280
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
into any of the

2281
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
most popular builds

2282
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
in the past couple

2283
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:03,000
seasons since

2284
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
spirit born was

2285
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:04,000
released.

2286
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And we've updated

2287
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
the two upgrade

2288
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
choices to be

2289
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
kind of transformative.

2290
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
It's kind of a

2291
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
if you pick one upgrade

2292
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
the current one

2293
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
rushing claws

2294
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
has four charges

2295
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
and so when you

2296
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,000
use a charge

2297
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
you kind of

2298
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,000
quickly dash

2299
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
through an enemy.

2300
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
And so you have

2301
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
four charges

2302
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,000
you can spam it

2303
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
four times

2304
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,000
real quick.

2305
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
The other upgrade

2306
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
now has been

2307
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,000
reworked where it

2308
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
gains even more

2309
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
charges.

2310
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
It gains 12 charges

2311
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
but using it

2312
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
consumes all the

2313
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:34,000
charges.

2314
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
So really it

2315
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
has just one

2316
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
but for every

2317
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
charge that it

2318
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
consumes it deals

2319
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
massively increased

2320
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
damage and it

2321
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
hits a wider area.

2322
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So now gaining

2323
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,000
cooldown reduction

2324
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
or gaining more

2325
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
charges actually just

2326
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
increases your damage

2327
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
output and it

2328
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
promotes a very

2329
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
different play style

2330
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,000
for this.

2331
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,000
So you get kind of

2332
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
an option.

2333
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You can choose the

2334
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
original version

2335
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
which is still very

2336
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
powerful and very

2337
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
cool or you can

2338
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,000
choose the new

2339
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
upgrade and kind of

2340
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
spend all your

2341
01:16:59,000 --> 01:16:59,000
charges at once,

2342
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
do a big kind of

2343
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
damage cooldown

2344
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
and then work on

2345
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
building up those

2346
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
charges again to

2347
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
deal even more.

2348
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Additionally we've

2349
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
looked at storm

2350
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
feathers and

2351
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
specifically how they

2352
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
interact with the

2353
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
new unique item

2354
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
the sunbird's

2355
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
gorget which I

2356
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
think we've got a

2357
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
picture of right

2358
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,000
here.

2359
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
So the sunbird's

2360
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
gorget is a new

2361
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
unique amulet.

2362
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
This really works

2363
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
to synergize with

2364
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
the eagle and

2365
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
jaguar builds.

2366
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So it says picking

2367
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
up a storm feather

2368
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
which you can create

2369
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
in many different

2370
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,000
ways.

2371
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
will form a fire

2372
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
storm around you

2373
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,000
for 8 seconds

2374
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
that deals fire

2375
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:33,000
damage.

2376
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And every additional

2377
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
storm feather that

2378
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
you pick up is

2379
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
going to intensify

2380
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,000
this firestorm.

2381
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
It's going to make

2382
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
it grow in size

2383
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
up to a maximum

2384
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
and then it's going

2385
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
to increase its

2386
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,000
damage output.

2387
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,000
For as many

2388
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
storm feathers as

2389
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
you can spawn

2390
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
this firestorm is

2391
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:47,000
going to get more

2392
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
intense.

2393
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
But it only lasts

2394
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
for 8 seconds

2395
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
so intensifying it

2396
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
or picking up more

2397
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
storm feathers

2398
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
it's not going to

2399
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:54,000
extend the duration.

2400
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:55,000
So it's kind of

2401
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
locked to that 8

2402
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
second duration

2403
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,000
and then it'll

2404
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
reset.

2405
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So you really want

2406
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,000
to collect as many

2407
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
storm feathers as

2408
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
possible in 8 seconds

2409
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
and then it restarts.

2410
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And also this firestorm

2411
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
is considered an eagle,

2412
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
jaguar, and storm feather

2413
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,000
skill.

2414
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
So you've got lots of

2415
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
options for how you

2416
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
want to increase this

2417
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,000
damage through your

2418
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
other talent choices

2419
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
or your itemization.

2420
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,000
You've got lots of

2421
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
options for how to

2422
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
work this into a build

2423
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
in either eagle or

2424
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
jaguar or both.

2425
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
And following up on the

2426
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
theme with rushing

2427
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,000
claw we've got the

2428
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
new rip and tear

2429
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
aspect where rushing

2430
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
claw is going to

2431
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
deal increased damage

2432
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
and is empowered based

2433
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
on how many charges

2434
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
you had when you

2435
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
cast it.

2436
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
So if you're taking

2437
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
the upgrade that

2438
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
gives you 12 charges

2439
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
it's probably always

2440
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
going to be with 4

2441
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
plus and so it's

2442
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:39,000
going to strike an

2443
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
additional time.

2444
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
But if you're

2445
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
choosing the option

2446
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
where you spend each

2447
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
charge as you go

2448
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,000
it's going to go

2449
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
through a bit of a

2450
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,000
cycle here.

2451
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
You're going to get

2452
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
an additional strike

2453
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,000
then it's going to

2454
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
get a guaranteed crit

2455
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
then it's going to

2456
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:49,000
get a guaranteed

2457
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
overpower and when

2458
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,000
you just have one

2459
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
charge left it's

2460
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,000
going to give you

2461
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
a nice chunky heal

2462
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
to help keep you

2463
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,000
in the fight.

2464
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Nice.

2465
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:56,000
There's a ton of

2466
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
versatility in there.

2467
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

2468
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Lots of different

2469
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,000
ways to play and

2470
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
it works great with

2471
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
either way that

2472
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,000
rushing claw now

2473
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
works.

2474
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Alright, let's take

2475
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
a look at the

2476
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Sunbird's Gorget in

2477
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,000
action here, right?

2478
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
So you're moving

2479
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
along, you're picking

2480
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
up tons of these

2481
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
feathers and the

2482
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
firestorm around you

2483
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
just grows in

2484
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:12,000
intensity.

2485
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
You've got lots of

2486
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
different ways to

2487
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
scale it up and it

2488
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
provides a nice

2489
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
kind of passive AoE

2490
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
around you as you're

2491
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
picking them up and

2492
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,000
you're really going to

2493
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
want to make sure

2494
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
you're kind of

2495
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
thinking about

2496
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
exactly how your

2497
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
character's moving to

2498
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,000
make sure you're

2499
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
picking up as many

2500
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,000
of these storm

2501
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
feathers as possible

2502
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
to maximize your

2503
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
damage output.

2504
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Alright, that's a

2505
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
lot.

2506
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,000
We got a lot of

2507
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
new class content

2508
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
coming for every

2509
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:36,000
class.

2510
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,000
We did get through

2511
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
all of them.

2512
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:39,000
But yeah, I'm

2513
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
really looking forward

2514
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
to seeing all the

2515
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
new builds that

2516
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
these empower, how

2517
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
they modify old

2518
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
existing builds, and

2519
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
all the interesting

2520
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
combinations that I'm

2521
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
sure all of you

2522
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
will test out on the

2523
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
PTR and find out the

2524
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
most absolutely

2525
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
broken thing and let

2526
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
me know about it.

2527
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Yes, please let us

2528
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,000
know if you find

2529
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
something absolutely

2530
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
broken, which I'm

2531
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
sure you will.

2532
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Thank you again,

2533
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Charles, for walking

2534
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,000
us through all the

2535
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
different class

2536
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,000
changes.

2537
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Again, we do plan on

2538
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
having patch notes

2539
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,000
along with the blog

2540
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
related to everything

2541
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
tied to PTR.

2542
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
So there's other

2543
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
changes that we

2544
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:11,000
didn't actually cover

2545
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
often here.

2546
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
That will be on

2547
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
the Diablo4.com

2548
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
immediately after the

2549
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
stream.

2550
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
So everyone can

2551
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
actually check it

2552
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,000
out, inspect it,

2553
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
do their theory

2554
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,000
crafting and

2555
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
everything related to

2556
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:23,000
that.

2557
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Of course, with PTR,

2558
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
we kind of want to

2559
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
know when PTR

2560
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
actually begins.

2561
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
PTR is starting

2562
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
next Tuesday, and

2563
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,000
this is, of course,

2564
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
PTR on PC Battle

2565
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Net, so players

2566
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,000
will be able to

2567
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
jump in starting on

2568
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
the 11th, and it

2569
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
will run for a week

2570
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,000
there.

2571
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I will note that

2572
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
players actually will

2573
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
be able to also

2574
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
pre-download the

2575
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
PTR the day prior,

2576
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
so around Monday

2577
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
afternoon here in

2578
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
California.

2579
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Translate that

2580
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
using some sort

2581
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:49,000
of time tool.

2582
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
That will be when

2583
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
players will be able

2584
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
to pre-download, so

2585
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
it will be about a

2586
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:55,000
day beforehand.

2587
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
One thing to note

2588
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
is, of course, the

2589
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
boost vendor,

2590
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
MRAC, will be

2591
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
available, which

2592
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
will be dancing in

2593
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
town for everyone.

2594
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
But one thing we

2595
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
did want to note is

2596
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
that the boost

2597
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
themselves will be

2598
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
available probably

2599
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
two days after the

2600
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
PTR actually begins.

2601
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
The reason behind

2602
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
this is actually a

2603
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
little bit tied to

2604
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
how Season 7

2605
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:16,000
performed.

2606
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
One thing we

2607
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
allowed players to

2608
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,000
do was immediately

2609
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
boost the second

2610
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
they got into PTR,

2611
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
and we really

2612
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:23,000
didn't get that

2613
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
whole entire flow

2614
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
as we were

2615
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,000
kind of going

2616
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,000
through.

2617
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Yeah, the

2618
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
head hunt and

2619
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,000
things like that.

2620
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So we also just

2621
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:29,000
want to hear your

2622
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
feedback on the

2623
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
leveling process.

2624
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
This is why we

2625
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
run the PTR.

2626
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
We really want to

2627
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,000
hear your thoughts

2628
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
on how the

2629
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
sort of more

2630
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
uniform leveling

2631
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
feels, how the

2632
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,000
legendary drop

2633
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
rates feel.

2634
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
so that is

2635
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
really valuable

2636
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,000
to us for

2637
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
launching a

2638
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
really awesome

2639
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Season 8

2640
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Return of the

2641
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Wild.

2642
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yeah, and so

2643
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
after a couple

2644
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:46,000
days, MRAC

2645
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
will be more

2646
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
than happy to

2647
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,000
take your

2648
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Paragon levels

2649
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
to insane

2650
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,000
numbers.

2651
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
So PTR boost

2652
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
will be available

2653
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
just a couple

2654
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
days after that.

2655
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
One other thing

2656
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I do want to

2657
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
note is we

2658
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
will of course

2659
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,000
have our

2660
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
forums available

2661
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
and online

2662
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
for PTR.

2663
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,000
That is the

2664
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
best place to

2665
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:03,000
actually provide

2666
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
feedback.

2667
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Of course, we

2668
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,000
do look in

2669
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
other places

2670
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
such as Reddit,

2671
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Discord, etc.

2672
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
but I will

2673
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,000
say the

2674
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
forums is

2675
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:10,000
kind of

2676
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
we turn

2677
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,000
them on

2678
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
specifically

2679
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,000
like a

2680
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
PTR section

2681
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:13,000
so please

2682
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
put feedback

2683
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
in there

2684
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,000
because we

2685
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
are constantly

2686
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
checking in

2687
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:17,000
there for

2688
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
any notes

2689
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,000
feedback from

2690
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
players on

2691
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:19,000
that end.

2692
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,000
One other

2693
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
note is

2694
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,000
within the

2695
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
PTR, you

2696
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
guys may

2697
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
see a term

2698
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
called the

2699
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Reliquary

2700
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
that may

2701
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
just kind

2702
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:28,000
of pop

2703

2704
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
and there

2705
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,000
and we

2706
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
haven't talked

2707
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,000
about the

2708
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Reliquary

2709
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
nor will

2710
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
the blog

2711
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,000
later today

2712
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
actually be

2713
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,000
talking about

2714
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
the Reliquary.

2715
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I will say

2716
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,000
that you guys

2717
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
will hear more

2718
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,000
about the

2719
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Reliquary

2720
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
before the

2721
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
start of

2722
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Season 8

2723
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
in itself

2724
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
but for

2725
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
right now

2726
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
ignore it

2727
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
turn a blind

2728
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,000
eye

2729
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I don't

2730
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:47,000
know

2731
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
but it

2732
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
is a

2733
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
rework of

2734
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
our Battle

2735
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Pass system

2736
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,000
that we're

2737
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,000
doing

2738
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,000
we're trying

2739
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
to

2740
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
we've heard

2741
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
a lot of

2742
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,000
comments from

2743
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
players related

2744
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
to the Battle

2745
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Pass

2746
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
trying to make

2747
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it a little

2748
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,000
bit more

2749
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
customizable

2750
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
for people

2751
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,000
especially

2752
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
for rewards

2753
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,000
that they're

2754
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
looking for

2755
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:02,000
so we'll

2756
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
have a

2757
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,000
detailed

2758
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,000
breakdown

2759
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
of what

2760
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
the Reliquary

2761
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,000
is before

2762
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Season 8

2763
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
so looking

2764
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
forward to

2765
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:08,000
kind of

2766
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
sharing that

2767
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
before we

2768
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,000
actually kick

2769
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
off this

2770
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:11,000
season

2771
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
and I

2772
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,000
know I

2773
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
have a lot

2774
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I'm trying to

2775
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,000
get through all my

2776
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,000
stuff

2777
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I know

2778
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:15,000
it's like

2779
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I'm hungry

2780
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
the last thing

2781
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,000
we do want to

2782
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,000
talk about

2783
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
is I've

2784
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
gotten asked

2785
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
a million

2786
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
times about

2787
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,000
this and I've

2788
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
even seen it

2789
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,000
in chat

2790
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
and it's

2791
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,000
related to

2792
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
a roadmap

2793
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
for Diablo

2794
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
4 and I

2795
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:29,000
will say

2796
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
that we

2797
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
are actively

2798
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
working on

2799
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,000
a roadmap

2800
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
that we can

2801
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,000
share with

2802
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,000
you all

2803
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
which is

2804
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
great because

2805
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:35,000

01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000

2809
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:39,000

2810
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000

01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,000
here

2906
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,000
there we

2907
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,000
go

2908
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
how does

2909
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
party play

2910
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,000
work with

2911
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
lair bosses

2912
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,000
we kind of

2913
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
covered this

2914
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,000
a little bit

2915
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,000
but I don't

2916
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
know if you

2917
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,000
guys want to

2918
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,000
go into

2919
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
specifically

2920
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
more details

2921
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
on this

2922
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
yeah I can

2923
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,000
jump into

2924
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,000
that

2925
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
so when

2926
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
you are

2927
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
fighting

2928
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:56,000
the lair

2929
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:56,000
bosses

2930
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
in a party

2931
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and the

2932
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
horde

2933
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
spawns

2934
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
when you

2935
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
open the

2936
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
horde

2937
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
we essentially

2938
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
do a bonus

2939
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
chance for

2940
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,000
an extra

2941
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,000
drop

2942
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
based on

2943
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
the amount

2944
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
of party

2945
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
play

2946
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,000
players

2947
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
party

2948
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,000
play

2949
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
so if

2950
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,000
you're

2951
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,000
in a

2952
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,000
party

2953
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
of four

2954
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:09,000
and you

2955
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
open up

2956
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,000
that

2957
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,000
horde

2958
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,000
it's

2959
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,000
going

2960
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,000
to

2961
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
guarantee

2962
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,000
an

2963
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,000
extra

2964
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
unique

2965
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,000
item

2966
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
so it

2967
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,000
scales

2968
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
with

2969
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,000
the

2970
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:36,000

2971
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:36,000
tech

2972
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
super

2973
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,000
high

2974
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,000
tech

2975
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
let's

2976
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,000
see

2977
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,000
this

2978
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,000
is

2979
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,000
from

2980
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000

2981

tv

2982
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
any

2983
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,000
plans

2984
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,000
to

2985
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,000
place

2986
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
a

2987
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,000
blacksmith

2988
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,000
or

2989
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
vendor

2990
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,000
near

2991
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,000
the

2992
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,000
boss

2993
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
rooms

2994
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:44,000
to

2995
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:44,000
help

2996
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
people

2997
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,000
quickly

2998
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
salvage

2999
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,000
slash

3000
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,000
clear

3001
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
inventory

3002
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,000
without

3003
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,000
having

3004
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,000
to

3005
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
go

3006
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,000
into

3007
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,000
town

3008
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I

3009
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,000
think

3010
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,000
this

3011
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,000
is

3012
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,000
something

3013
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
that

3014
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,000
we

3015
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,000
can

3016
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,000
definitely

3017
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
take

3018
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,000
away

3019
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,000
and

3020
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
consider

3021
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,000
especially

3022
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,000
with

3023
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,000
the

3024
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
revamp

3025
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:54,000
flow

3026
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
that's

3027
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:55,000
definitely

3028
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:55,000
something

3029
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
that's

3030
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,000
interesting

3031
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
one

3032
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,000
thing

3033
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,000
that

3034
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,000
the

3035
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
revamp

3036
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,000
flow

3037
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
does

3038
01:25:59,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I

3039
01:25:59,000 --> 01:25:59,000
will

3040
01:25:59,000 --> 01:25:59,000
touch

3041
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
some

3042
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,000
philosophy

3043
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,000
here

3044
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,000
is

3045
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
we've

3046
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,000
heard

3047
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,000
a lot

3048
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,000
of

3049
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,000
feedback

3050
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
that

3051
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,000
it

3052
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,000
feels

3053
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
mandatory

3054
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,000
to

3055
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,000
play

3056
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
some

3057
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,000
of

3058
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,000
these

3059
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
bosses

3060
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,000
in

3061
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,000
a

3062
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,000
party

3063
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
just

3064
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,000
because

3065
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,000
chain

3066
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
bossing

3067
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,000
is

3068
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,000
so

3069
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,000
lucrative

3070
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
and

3071
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:15,000
we

3072
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:15,000
do

3073
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
expect

3074
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,000
some

3075
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,000
amount

3076
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,000
of

3077
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,000
the

3078
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,000
chain

3079
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
bossing

3080
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
to

3081
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,000
come

3082
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,000
down

3083
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,000
a

3084
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,000
little

3085
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,000
bit

3086
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
because

3087
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,000
a

3088
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,000
lot

3089
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,000
more

3090
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,000
of

3091
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,000
the

3092
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
resources

3093
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,000
are

3094
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,000
being

3095
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
consumed

3096
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,000
when

3097
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,000
opening

3098
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
those

3099
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,000
chests

3100
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,000
so

3101
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
it's

3102
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,000
not

3103
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,000
a

3104
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
direct

3105
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,000
answer

3106
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,000
to

3107
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,000
your

3108
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
question

3109
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,000
I

3110
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,000
think

3111
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,000
it's

3112
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,000
an

3113
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
interesting

3114
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,000
idea

3115
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
but

3116
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I

3117
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,000
do

3118
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
think

3119
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:28,000

bossing

3124
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,000
and

3125
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,000
required

3126
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
trips

3127
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and

3128
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,000
flow

3129
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,000
breaks

3130
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
to

3131
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:31,000
go

3132
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:31,000

I

3184
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,000

is

3192
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
something

3193
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I

3194
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
definitely

3195
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,000
experience

3196
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,000

big

3200
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,000
pain

3201
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,000
in

3202
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,000
the

3203
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,000
ass

3204
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,000
where

3205
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
it's

3206
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,000
like

3207
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,000
oh

3208
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,000
there's

3209
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,000
some

3210
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000

3211
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
bounty

3212
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
or

3213
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
apparition

3214
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:01,000
incursion

3215
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
but I

3216
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,000
have to

3217
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,000
go

3218
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,000
get

3219
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,000
the

3220
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
waypoint

3221
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
it's

3222
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,000
something

3223
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,000
the team

3224
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,000
has

3225
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
been

3226
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:05,000
talking

3227
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:05,000
about

3228
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:05,000
there's

3229
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:05,000
no

3230
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
concrete

3231
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
plans

3232
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:07,000

know

3236
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:07,000
is

3237
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
disappointing

3238
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,000
but

3239
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
it's

3240
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,000
something

3241
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,000
we

3242
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,000
know

3243
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,000
is

3244
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,000
a

3245
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
problem

3246
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,000
and

3247
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,000
something

3248
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,000
we

3249
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
100%

3250
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,000
want

3251
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,000
to

3252
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
tackle

3253
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,000
in

3254
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,000
the

3255
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
near

3256
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,000
future

3257
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
awesome

3258
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
jokums

3259
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
says

3260
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
this is

3261
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
actually a

3262
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,000
question

3263
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,000
that

3264
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
you know

3265
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
we were

3266
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,000
talking

3267
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,000
about

3268
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,000
that

3269
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,000
might

3270
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
actually

3271
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,000
come

3272
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,000
up

3273
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,000
but

3274
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
would

3275
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,000
you

3276
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,000
consider

3277
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,000
adding

3278
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
the

3279
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:23,000
frog

3280
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:23,000
from

Season 7

3285
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,000
as a

3286
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
permanent

3287
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,000
companion

3288
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
skill

3289
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,000
for

3290
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Druids

3291
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
and

3292
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
at the

3293
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:29,000
moment

3294
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:29,000
I

3295
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:29,000
can

3296
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:29,000
say

3297
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
we're

3298
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,000
not

3299
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
for

3300
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,000
that

3301
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
specifically

3302
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:32,000
but

3303
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
it

3304
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:33,000
is

3305
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:33,000
a

3306
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
thing

3307
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,000
that

3308
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I

3309
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,000
think

3310
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,000
we

3311
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
didn't

3312
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:35,000
really

3313
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:35,000
clarify

3314
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
in

3315
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:36,000
regards

3316
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:36,000
to

3317
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
what

3318
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:37,000
from

3319
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Season 7

3320
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,000

01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
too

3789
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:25,000
fast

3790
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:25,000

3793
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:26,000
or

3794
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:26,000
build

3795
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
trivial

3796
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
trivial

3797
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I can't

01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
trivial

3801
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I can't

3802
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,000
even

01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,000
talk

3804
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I think

3805
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
this is

3806
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,000
a great

3807
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,000
question

3808
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,000
it's

3809
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
something

3810
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,000
we

3811
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,000
talk

3812
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,000
about

3813
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,000
on

3814
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
the

3815
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,000
team

3816
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
a

3817
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:36,000
bunch

3818
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
and

3819
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:37,000
from

3820
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
our

3821
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,000
perspective

3822
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
adding

3823
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
something

3824
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,000
like

3825
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,000
resilience

3826
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
would

3827
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,000
sort

3828
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
of

3829
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:42,000
devalue

3830
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:42,000
that

3831
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
power

3832
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:43,000
progression

3833
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
we feel

3834
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:44,000
like

3835
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:44,000
it

3836
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
disservices

3837
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
that

3838
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,000
zero

3839
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,000
to

3840
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
hero

3841
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
once

3842
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Belial

3843
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,000
was

3844
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
really

3845
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:49,000
hard

3846
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:49,000
but

3847
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:49,000
now

3848
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I've

3849
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
gotten

3850
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,000
so

3851
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,000
strong

3852
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I

3853
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,000
can

3854
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,000
just

3855
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
crush

3856
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:51,000
him

3857
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
that

3858
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:52,000
said

3859
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
we

3860
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,000
do

3861
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,000
think

3862
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,000
that

3863
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000

3869
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,000
bosses

3870
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
that

3871
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,000
has

3872
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,000
been

3873
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,000
happening

3874
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,000
is

3875
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
a

3876
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,000
little

3877
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,000
bit

3878
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,000
too

3879
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,000
much

3880
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
there

3881
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,000
isn't

3882
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,000
enough

3883
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,000
of

3884
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,000
a

3885
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
journey

3886
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,000
to

3887
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,000

point

3891
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
where

3892
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I

3893
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
can

3894
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
just

3895
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
stomp

3896
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000

01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Varshawn

3898
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,000

I

3900
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,000

knight

3907
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
so

3908
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,000
what

3909
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,000
we

3910
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,000
have

3911
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
done

3912
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,000
is

3913
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,000
like

3914
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Derek

3915
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,000

3916
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,000
earlier

3917
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
in

01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:07,000
the

01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:07,000
stream

3920
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:07,000
we've

3921
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
massively

3922
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,000
buffed

3923
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,000
a lot

3924
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,000

3927
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
so

3928
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,000
much

3929
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
so

3930
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,000
they

3931
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,000
were

we

01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:32,000
a

that

where

01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,000
you're

4005
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,000
really

4006
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,000
farming

4007
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
some

4008
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,000
of

4009
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,000
these

4010
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,000
bosses

4011
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
is

4012
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:38,000
a

4016
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
but

4017
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,000
it's

4018
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,000
longer

4019
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
also

4020
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:40,000
you're

4021
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:40,000
not

4022
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:40,000
just

4023
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
walking

4024
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:41,000

01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:41,000
1

4027
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
and

4028
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,000
one

4029
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,000
shot

4030
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,000
and

4031
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
that

4032
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,000
ties

4033
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,000
into

4034
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
what

4035
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I

4036
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,000
talked

4037
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,000
about

4038
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,000
with

4039
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,000
some

4040
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
of

4041
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,000
the

4042
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,000
outlier

4043
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,000
builds

4044
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,000
that

4045
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
were

4046
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,000
just

4047
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,000
blood

4048
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,000
wave

4049
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
macro

4050
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,000
prime

4051
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
example

4052
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:49,000
of

4053
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
being

4054
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:50,000
something

4055
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:50,000
where

4056
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
you get

4057
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,000
one

4058
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,000
item

4059
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,000
and

4060
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,000
then

4061
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
suddenly

4062
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,000
you

4063
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,000
can

4064
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,000
one

4065
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,000
shot

4066
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
everything

4067
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
it's

4068
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,000
really

4069
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
not

4070
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
it

4071
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,000
doesn't

4072
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,000
promote

4073
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
the best

4074
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:57,000
gameplay

4075
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
it's

4076
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
fun

4077
01:31:59,000 --> 01:31:59,000
for a

4078
01:31:59,000 --> 01:31:59,000
little

4079
01:31:59,000 --> 01:31:59,000
bit

4080
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
to

4081
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,000
go

4082
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,000
in

4083
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,000
one

4084
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,000
shot

4085
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
everything

4086
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,000
but

4087
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
that's

4088
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
something

4089
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:03,000
we

4090
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:03,000
think

4091
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
it's

4092
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,000
much

4093
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,000
more

4094
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,000
engaging

4095
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
to

4096
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,000
have

4097
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,000
a

01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
power

4099
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:12,000
progression

4100
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:12,000

4101
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
as

4102
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,000
you

4103
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,000
get

4104
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,000
more

4105
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,000
powerful

4106
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
and

4107
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:14,000
more

4108
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:14,000
gear

4109
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:14,000
and

4110
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:14,000
more

4111
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
paragon

4112
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:15,000
levels

4113
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:15,000
you

4114
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
do

4115
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,000
get

4116
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,000
more

4117
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,000
powerful

4118
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,000
and

4119
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,000
it

4120
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
becomes

4121
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:17,000
easier

4122
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:17,000
to

4123
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
overcome

4124
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,000
these

4125
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,000
challenges

4126
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
and

4127
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,000
then

4128
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,000
you

4129
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,000
start

4130
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,000
feeling

4131
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:19,000
that

4132
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
real

4133
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,000
powerful

4134
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,000
stuff

4135
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
as

4136
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,000
you

4137
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,000
really

4138
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
complete

4139
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,000
your

4140
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,000
build

4141
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
yeah

4142
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,000
and

4143
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,000
I'll

4144
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,000
also

4145
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
say

4146
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:24,000
like

4147
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I

4148
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,000
think

4149
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
part

4150
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,000
of

4151
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,000
how

4152
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,000
we

4153
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
set

4154
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,000
up

4155
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
the

4156
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:28,000

4159
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000

4165
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
right

4166
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:31,000
like

4167
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
if

4168
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,000
you

4169
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,000

boss

4177
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,000
why

4178
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,000
would

4179
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,000
you

4180
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,000
ever

4181
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,000

4182
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
the

4183
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
boss

4184
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
when

4185
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
it's

4186
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
actually

4187
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
a

4188
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,000
challenge

4189
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,000
right

4190
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,000
you

4191
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,000
would

4192
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
only

4193
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,000
fight

4194
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,000
it

4195
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,000
when

4196
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,000
it's

4197
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,000
really

4198
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
difficult

4199
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:38,000
but

4200
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:38,000
the

4201
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
changes

4202
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:39,000
that

4203
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
we've

4204
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,000
made

4205
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,000
have

4206
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
really

4207
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,000
sort

4208
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
of

4209
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,000
you

4210
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,000
know

4211
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,000
in a

4212
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
fun

4213
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,000
way

4214
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I'm

4215
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,000
hoping

4216
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
this

4217
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,000
plays

4218
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,000
out

4219
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,000
that

4220
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,000
you

4221
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
can

4222
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,000
sort

4223
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,000
of

4224
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,000
maybe

4225
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,000
get

4226
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,000
a

4227
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
cheeky

4228
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,000
run

4229
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,000
in

4230
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,000
on

4231
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Varshan

4232
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,000
when

4233
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,000
maybe

4234
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,000
he's

4235
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,000
really

4236
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
hard

4237
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,000
but

4238
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,000
you

4239
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,000
get

4240
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,000
a

4241
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,000
really

4242
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,000
would

4243
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,000
definitely

4244
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
resolve

4245
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:03,000
it

4246
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:03,000
but

4247
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
within

4248
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,000
season

4249
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,000
eight

4250
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,000
the

4251
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,000
team

4252
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
took

4253
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,000
the

4254
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,000
extra

4255
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
opportunity

4256
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,000
to

4257
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,000
also

4258
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
just

4259
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:07,000
inject

4260
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
new

4261
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,000
mechanics

4262
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,000
and

4263
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,000
updated

4264
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
mechanics

4265
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:09,000
to

4266
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:09,000
the

4267
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
lair bosses

4268
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,000
across

4269
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,000
the board

4270
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
to

4271
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
introduce

4272
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000

4273
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:13,000

01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:13,000
challenge

4275
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
but

4276
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,000
in an

4277
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,000
interesting

4278
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
way

4279
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:15,000
that's

4280
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:15,000
just

4281
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:15,000
more

4282
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
fun

4283
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I guess

4284
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
really

4285
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:18,000

4286
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000

01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000

4294
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,000
through

4295
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,000
a few

4296
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000

4297
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,000

01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:29,000
an

4305
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000

4306
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,000

4308
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,000
the

4309
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,000
boss

4310
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,000

4312
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,000

4313
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,000
anything

4314
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,000
this

01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
that's

4322
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:36,000

this

4576
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:11,000
lets

4577
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:11,000
us

4578
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:11,000
have

4579
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:11,000

4584
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
but

4585
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:13,000
things

4586
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:13,000
that

4587
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:13,000
you

4588
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000

4594
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
I'll

4595
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,000
just

4596
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,000
say

4597
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,000
too

4598
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,000
is

4599

4600
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,000

4601
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,000
the

4602
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,000
game

4603
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,000
is

4604
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
random

4605
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,000

4606
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,000
and

4607
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
figuring

4608
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:19,000
out

4609
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:19,000
how

4610
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:19,000
to

4611
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
assemble

4612
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,000
a

4614
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,000

4619
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,000
so

4620
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
we

4621
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:22,000
don't

4622
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:22,000

4634
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I

4635
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,000
get

4636
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,000
all

4637
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,000

01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:27,000
and

4642
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I'm

4643
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
done

4644
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,000
with

4645
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,000
the

4647
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,000
and

4648
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
it's

4649
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:29,000
this

4650
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
linear

4651
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:30,000

4657
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,000
that

4658
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,000
you

4659
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
want

4660
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
but

4661
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,000
that

4662
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,000
said

4663
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
we're

4664
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:35,000
always

4665
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
listening

4666
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,000

4669
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,000

4670
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
if

4671
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:37,000
it

4672
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:37,000
does

4673
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:37,000
start

4674
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:37,000
to

01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:37,000
feel

4676
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
like

4677
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I'm

4678
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
constantly

4679
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:39,000
sifting

4682
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I

4683
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,000
don't

4684
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,000
care

01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,000

4690
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
we

4691
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,000
can

4692
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,000
absolutely

4693
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,000

01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,000
yeah

4698
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,000

4699
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000

4700
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:44,000

4721
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:49,000

01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,000
had

4738
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000

01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
it

4743
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:57,000
wasn't

season

4784
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
but

4785
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:10,000
additionally

4786
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
we are

4787
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,000
also

4788
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,000
taking

4789
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,000
a look

4790
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,000

4795
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:14,000

4799
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000

4800
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,000
a

4801
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,000
good

4811
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:18,000
season

4812
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
that

4813
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:19,000
was

4814
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:19,000
an

4818
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
sometimes

4819
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,000
played

4820
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,000
but

4821
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,000
not

4822
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
often

4823
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,000
for

4824
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,000
its

4825
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,000
actual

4826
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000

4827
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,000

4828
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,000
for

4829
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,000
some

4830
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,000
of

4831
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,000
its

4832
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000

4833
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:24,000
actually

4834
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:24,000
it

4835
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:24,000
was

4836
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
pretty

4837
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,000
powerful

4838
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
but

4839
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,000
its

4840
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,000

lackluster

4845
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,000
and

4846
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,000
so

4847
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,000
we've

4848
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
done

4849
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:29,000
a

4850
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:29,000
whole

4852
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
on

4853
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,000
it

4854
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,000
we

4855
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,000
said

4856
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,000
hey

4857
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
what's

4858
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:31,000
the

4859
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:31,000
identity

4860
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:31,000
of

4861
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:31,000
this

4862
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:31,000
well

4863
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
it's

4864
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,000
talking

4865
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,000
to

4866
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
death

4867
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,000
trap

4868
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,000
builds

4869
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,000
in

4870
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,000
a

4871
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,000
way

4872
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
but

4873
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,000
in

4874
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,000
a

4875
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,000
way

4876
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
that

4877
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,000
wasn't

4878
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,000
super

4879
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,000
compelling

4880
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
and

4881
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,000
so

4882
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,000
we

4883
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,000
said

4884
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
well

4885
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:37,000
let's

4886
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
scrap

4887
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:38,000
that

4888
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
existing

4889
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,000
effect

4890
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,000
and

4891
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
how

4892
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,000
can

4893
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,000
we

4894
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,000
better

4895
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
support

4896
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,000
that

4897
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,000
let's

4898
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,000
take

4899
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,000
another

4901
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,000
at

4902
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,000
this

4903
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
so

4904
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:43,000
that's

4905
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
one

4906
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,000
way

4907
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,000
that

4908
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,000
we're

4909
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,000
going

4910
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,000
to

4911
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,000
look

4912
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
to

4913
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
find

4914
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:46,000
those

4915
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
underused

4916
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:47,000
uniques

4917
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
that

4918
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,000
really

4919
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,000
don't

4920
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,000
find

4921
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
a

4922
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,000
home

4923
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
we're

4924
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,000
going

4925
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,000
to

4926
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,000
constantly

4927
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,000
be

4928
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
reevaluating

4929
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,000
them

4930
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,000
and seeing

4931
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
how

4932
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,000
we can

4933
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,000
plus

4934
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
them

4935
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:53,000
up

4936
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:53,000
and

4937
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
make

4938
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,000
them

4939
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,000
achieve

4940
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
the

4941
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,000
potential

4942
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,000
and

4943
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
fulfill

4944
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:56,000
that

4945
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
build

4946
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,000
niche

4947
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,000
that

4948
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
they

4949
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,000
were

4950
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,000
intended

4951
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,000
to

4952
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,000
do

4953
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,000
in

4954
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
the

4955
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,000
first

4956
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,000
place

4957
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
all right

4958
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I mean

4959
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I ended

4960
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
with the

4961
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,000
last

4962
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,000
question

4963
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,000
because

4964
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
everyone's

4965
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:03,000
asking

4966
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
this

4967
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,000
related

4968
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,000
to

4969
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
aspirational

4970
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
content

4971
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
is there

4972
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,000
going to

4973
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,000
be

4974
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,000

4977
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:08,000
for that

4978
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
things

4979
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:09,000
like

4980
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
whether

4981
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,000
it's

4982
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
potential

4983
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
leader

4984
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:12,000

like

4988
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,000
endgame

4989
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000

game

5058
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I'll

5059
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
also

5060
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,000

tiers

5071
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:42,000

5072
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000

up

5078
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
a little

5079
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,000
bit

01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,000

challenging

5084
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000

5085
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,000
satisfying

5086
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,000

01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,000
season

5092
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,000

and

5099
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,000
it

5100
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,000
was

5101
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
a

5102
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,000

5106
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,000
like

5107
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,000
the

5108
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000

5112
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
scenes

5113
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000

01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
only

5118
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,000
the

5119
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,000
important

5120
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
people

01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,000
it

5125
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,000

5129
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
redeemed

5130
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
yeah but

5131
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
season seven

5132
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
was really

5133
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
fast and

5134
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,000
we do

5135
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,000
think

5136
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
when the

5137
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:19,000
game

5138
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:19,000
reaches

5139
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
that

5140
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,000
state

5141
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,000
if

5142
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,000
we're

5143
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,000
just

5144
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
nothing

5145
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:21,000
really

5146
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:21,000
you have

5147
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
to

5148
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
work

5149
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
towards

5150
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:27,000
so

5151
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:27,000
we

5152
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
are

5153
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:28,000
sort

5154
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:28,000
of

5155
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:28,000
taking

5156
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
an

5157
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,000
approach

5158
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,000
again

5159
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
with

5160
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,000
some

5161
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,000
of

5162
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,000
the

5163
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,000
balance

5164
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
changes

5165
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,000
to

5166
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
make

5167
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,000
some

5168
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,000
of

5169
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,000
the

5170
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,000
game

5171
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,000
feel

5172
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,000
a little

5173
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
bit

5174
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:33,000
more

5175
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:33,000
aspirational

5176
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
and

5177
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,000
it's

5178
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,000
a

5179
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
focus

5180
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,000
for

5181
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,000
our

5182
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,000
team

5183
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,000
going

5184
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
forward

5185
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:36,000
yeah

5186
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
and

5187
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I

5188
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,000
will

5189
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
say

5190
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,000
we've

5191
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,000
had

5192
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
conversations

5193
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:39,000
about

5194
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
this

5195
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I

5196
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,000
feel

5197
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,000
like

5198
