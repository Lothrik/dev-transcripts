00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello Diablo community, welcome to another Diablo 4 Campfire Chat.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is our PTR Campfire Chat for Season 8.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My name is Adam Fletcher, I'm the Director of Community here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Of course I'm joined by this panel.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A lot of familiar faces, do you guys want to introduce yourself?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hi, I'm Colin Feiner, I'm a Design Director on Diablo 4.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey, I'm Derek Nunez, I'm a Lead Seasons Designer here on Diablo 4.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And hi, I'm Charles Dunn, I'm a Class Designer working on the Final Design team.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Awesome, and we're also joined by Ruben, Ruben Marquez, aka Bloodshed.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He's actually behind the scenes, he'll be playing through some gameplay that we're going to be showing off here.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, there he is, he's saying hi, waving.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We'll see more of him here in a little bit with, maybe not Marak, Stan anymore.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We got to see a good minute and a half of him before the stream actually started.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Crazy day.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
First, I do want to start off with that we had a smoothie delivery this morning, and Marcus is not here.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As you can see, I'm here hosting this because he forgot my smoothie in the order.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So I just kicked him off the stream.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, I'm just kidding.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But I told him I'd bring it up because I'm like, oh, my smoothie's not here.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But either way, we have a lot to talk about regarding Season 8.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And that's actually the end of the stream, so that's all I wanted to bring up.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, we have a lot to talk about for Season 8 PTR, but I know a few other topics that we wanted to hit on

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
was kind of related to some of the quality of life stuff that's going to be coming with this specific season

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
based off of feedback and things we've seen within the game.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And also one big topic is around mid-season updates.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's actually something that a lot of people have been asking about.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And we do want to give a little bit of an update on what mid-season updates will be going forward

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and how we're kind of thinking about it from here.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So, Colin, did you want to talk a little bit about how we're planning on doing mid-season updates?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, I think first it's helpful to sort of talk about the history of the mid-season balance patch.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Originally, when we had talked about mid-season, it was pretty early in the lifecycle of Diablo 4.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We would add a ton of items and we do sort of envision doing a lot of big swings

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
in terms of big nerfs to overperforming builds and big buffs to underperforming builds.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But as we've seen, as we've added more progression and things like Season 4 itemization,

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
there's a lot more time investment in terms of getting your build online and really refining and optimizing it.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And what we found is when you put so much time into your character, it feels really bad when we nerf things, right?

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So, Season 6 is a great example where you might have done so much work to temper your gear

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and masterwork your gear and level up those paragons that we were really hesitant to do

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
like a big nerf swing as part of the mid-season balance patch.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sort of on the other hand, right, we didn't want to massively buff underperforming builds

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
to match the overperforming builds because we didn't want to create this insane, you know,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
sort of arms race and then we're at pit tier 9000, right?

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It'd be ridiculous.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So what we ended up doing was actually kind of like anemic number of tweaks.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Like they weren't really necessarily making a big impact.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And we took a step back and sort of asked ourselves like, well, what are we actually getting out of this?

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What are you, the players, actually getting out of this?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I think we're at a sort of point where we want to pivot and adjust our philosophy a little bit.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And I think we've already seen some of this philosophy come to life in Season 7.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, exactly.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I know, especially in the beginning of the season, people probably saw us make some tweaks

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
in the first couple of weeks related to some really crazy numbers that maybe they weren't even numbers

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
in some of the stuff that people saw in the start of the actual season.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So all that is to say, I think really what we're going to start taking a look at is not doing massive swings in the midseason,

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
but instead focusing our efforts on the launch of a season.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So we're going to take that time and we're going to make sure that like there's a much higher quality launch release

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and taking a lot of that balance time and making sure that when we do launch a season, it's higher quality, right?

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We want the pit tier disparities to be a little bit lower.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We want to make sure that, you know, when a new season launches, the new builds that we're adding are going to be really effective

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and there's a lot of new fun ways to play.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This doesn't mean we're never going to balance or touch the game.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It actually means we're just going to shift our efforts to the beginning of the season.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So early on, we're going to be pretty vigilant in terms of things that are underperforming or way overperforming

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and acting quickly on them.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The goal here is really to get everything closer in terms of like just like less egregious, you know, builds being super, super high up there.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We saw that, I think, specifically in like season six with like the spirit born and it kind of stayed consistent that way.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We know we got a lot of feedback of like, hey, this feels kind of poopy if, you know, my build is like, you know, 30, 40 pit tiers below.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And so the goal is really to kind of bring and keep things more aligned, especially at the start of the season.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So as Colin mentioned, in the first couple of weeks, I know there's going to be more effort in putting tweaks during that time to really respect the player's time as well.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, go ahead.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The timing is really important because like our mid-season updates in the past had come a month or a month and a half into the season once players have been really invested in their build.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And now we're going to be much more focused on rapid updates, you know, within a week or two after the season launch to make sure that if we are making those adjustments, it's at a point where, hey, you're not, you know, you're not complete with the season.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're not done yet.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And you can adjust and you can, you know, make sure that your time is respected in that way.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Definitely.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So to really clarify, you know, when the season launches, I'll use Bloodwave as an example.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That was something we saw pretty early on and it was way too overtuned, right?

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Like you didn't even really have to invest in your character to get to a point where you're godlike.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And that is something that we would probably act quickly on as a part of the next season, for example.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I think like a big point of clarity is like Bloodwave using that as an example is very much an S tier build right now in this season.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
S plus.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
S plus.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, S plus for sure.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I think that the goal is not to immediately take it to F or even immediately take it to C or anything like that.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's really keep it still an S but like also make sure that it's still like at least lined up with like the other builds that might be up there in that top tier.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Conversely too, I just want to make it super clear.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If we see things that we added that are new, for example, if the seasonal powers aren't performing in a way that feels really powerful and crunchy, we're going to be buffing those.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So it's not only looking out for the S plus, it's also looking for the things that missed the mark.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So we're going to be buffing those also.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Awesome.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So I know that players at the start of season eight will see us be a lot more reactionary towards those first couple weeks in the early part of that season.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So yeah, just wanted to clarify that with players because we've seen a lot of questions about mid-season updates.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is this a mid-season update when they see a patch or something like that?

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And so going forward, I know that's going to be the plan as we look at updating the game in the future.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And if you hide things early, I will Liam Nees in your ass.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I will know.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I will know.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There you go.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We heard it first.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Colin's just waiting behind you.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's what he does.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
In the closet.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Like the little demon kid right behind you.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Exactly.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The other thing that we want to talk about is kind of like state of the game, especially with season seven, where we're at and kind of how we're looking at that towards season eight.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think one of the biggest points of feedback we've heard related to season seven is kind of the pace of the game.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You know, sometimes you blink and you're level 20 and you're like, holy crap, what happened?

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So I know you wanted to talk a little bit more about that as well.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah, absolutely.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So just sort of our perspective on season seven has been the progression is very fast, way faster than we sort of expected.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Part of it is a lot of the really cool new seasonal powers.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Part of it's the head hunts being super lucrative and awesome.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And part of it's also just like the seasonal journey and the reputation board.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There's a lot of different ways to get a ton of power in Diablo 4.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And what we've seen is compared to season six, which had a lot of positive feedback as part of our rebound progression model,

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is that a lot of that has sort of gone down the drain in terms of how fast players are chewing through some of the content.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So we actually have a graph that we could look at.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I apologize.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is terrible.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But I just pulled it from the stat, our sort of stat page.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's not the greatest.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But this is a picture of season six.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You can see on the Y-axis here.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was taking roughly people around 15 to 17 hours on average to get to max level.

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We felt like that was a pretty good journey, right?

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Part of Diablo is that sort of zero to hero journey.

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And part of what's fun about leveling is you start to sort of form a build and find a lot of different pieces early on

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
when you're still forming your character where customization is really fun, right?

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're not necessarily locked into a build.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So we felt like that was a pretty good clip for hitting max level.

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's on average, right?

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So you could either go faster or slower depending on sort of how much of a blaster you are.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So we felt like that was a pretty good average, especially with difficulty tiers and your ability to sort of go faster or slower based on your pacing.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And let's go to season seven now.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And it nearly doubled.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So you can see that it was taking about nine hours on average, which is kind of insane, right?

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Again, this is the average.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So if you're, you know, if you're like a Wodijo of the world, it's probably more like two hours or like 30 minutes.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And that was something that we definitely feel like has sort of missed the mark in terms of that initial journey.

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So we are going to be making some changes just to adjust for a lot of the seasonal power and things like that.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We're not going to necessarily nerf the power of the seasonal power.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We still want you to feel powerful.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But we are going to essentially take a look at the one to 25 experience and just smooth that out a little bit,

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
which is going to essentially make the leveling experience a little bit closer to season six.

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So it is going to be a slower from one to 25.

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But one thing we've done to sort of compensate that is we've taken a look at the itemization.

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We don't like that rares and sort of magic items immediately disappear after the first five minutes of the game.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah, I think you kind of get to that point.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Like we were talking about if you get to like level 20, you blink and you're level 20.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And then at the same time you blink and you're like, oh, blues and yellows.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Like, I only look at oranges now.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Or like, what's this other color?

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So I know that we have some changes that you wanted to talk about.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, and again, like a lot of this is in the spirit of making sure that zero to hero journey is really satisfying, right?

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's what makes it so awesome when playing Diablo is that sort of I start with nothing and become a god, right?

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So we are taking a look at the itemization so that it doesn't just feel like a slog from one to 25.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What we're going to be doing is, oh, you know what?

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to jump actually into the legendaries really quick because it's really important, a really important part of this.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The other thing that was contributing to this leveling sort of pace was that players are getting a legendary every three to four minutes.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And that's from one to 60.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's not just in the end game.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And it just felt like legendary item quality was just too prevalent across the leveling journey.

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You didn't have, you sort of hit max level.

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
There was no journey to assembling your build.

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You just had everything as part of the codex of power.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So we're also reducing the legendary rate from leveling.

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We're not really touching the end game legendary drop rates, but from leveling we are adjusting that.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And to compensate that, to jump back into the magic and rares.

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We're making it so that magics can have up to two affixes.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So sometimes you're going to find, you know, from your one to 25 journey a pretty good magic item.

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It might actually be better than a rare, for example, because it might have dropped earlier for you.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It might have higher eye power.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And then we're also making it so that rares can sometimes have up to three affixes.

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And what that means is, you know, when you get a drop at level 35 from a whisper cache, right now, you know, in Season 7 it feels terrible when you don't get a legendary item.

186
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Because you just know that it's just not even worth looking at, right?

187
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But now that rare items can have up to three affixes, that means that you might have a really good imprintable base.

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It means all the rares that drop across the game from 1 to 60 could actually be pretty great gear for you.

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Especially with all of our crafting options.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So we think that this helps smooth out the 1 to 60 journey.

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I will caveat that the rare quality is not the best at max level still.

192
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's going to be a lower eye power, so you're not going to have to filter through a bunch of rares at max level.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We're not going to go back to pre-season 4.

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So, yeah, we think this is this sort of smoothing out of the leveling curve, taking a look at the magic rarities or the item qualities,

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
is just going to make the experience feel a lot more rewarding and satisfying as you go through these levels.

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And then I know some of the other items we've been talking about have been a little bit of that torment progression.

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We've seen drastic differences between Season 6 to Season 7, and it's something I know we're making tweaks to.

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, so the other half of Diablo is obviously the max level endgame, right?

199
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And we've heard a ton of feedback that it just feels like a weak endgame right now.

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You can just blast through all the torment tiers.

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There's nothing that's really satisfying about it.

202
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There's nothing to work towards just because you're just getting so much power so frequently and just really crushing this content.

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So what we've done here is, if we go to the slide, we've actually given...

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Actually, let me jump into some of the stats here because I think it's really interesting.

205
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A lot of people got to Torment 4 very quickly.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So on average, it was taking players around 15 hours to get to Torment 4.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's roughly double how quickly it took in Season 6, which is kind of insane.

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Again, it's the culmination of Seasonal Powers and all this crazy stuff going on.

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And the other part of it is that 50% of players are actually hitting Torment 4.

210
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And just from a philosophy standpoint, we really want whatever the hardest Torment tier is, in this case Torment 4, to be aspirational.

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And to us, that means around 10%.

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That means that, you know, if you're really Johnny Badass, you know, you need to be in the top 10% of players to actually get there.

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And it's not hitting the mark.

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So what we're going to do is make some adjustments.

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So Torment 1 is now going to start at Pit Tier 10, which means we've effectively added 10 Pit Tiers to the Pit because now Torment 1 starts earlier.

216
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And then we've also increased the Torment Pit Scaling health by roughly 20% multiplicative and then some damage increases.

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, and that Pit Scaling is, every level of a Pit is multiplicative on previous levels.

218
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So it's not just like, oh, whatever Pit I was at, it's now 20% harder.

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's actually like kind of stacking 20% every level.

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So the end result is that, you know, a Pit Tier 100 is much harder than it was before.

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And that will, that makes it, you know, harder to reach that absolute highest end.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And it gives you a little bit more for those builds and those Blasters who are getting up to that highest Pit Tier.

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There's going to be, it's going to be quite a bit harder to get to quite that same level next season.

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, absolutely.

225
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So with that, sort of culminates in moving Torment 1 to Pit Tier 10 and effectively adding 10 Pit Tiers

226
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and increasing the multiplicative scaling of the Pit Tier scaling is the journey is going to be a lot more sort of satisfying.

227
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There's a lot more sort of peaks to climb.

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And it also means Pit Tier 150 is going to be very difficult.

229
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So, so difficult that I don't believe any of you will reach it.

230
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know, I'll do something silly on the stream.

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He says this now.

232
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll probably, oh, that's not enough for doing something silly on the stream.

233
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And then like within the first stream.

234
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's a challenge to all of you out there.

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, you all can vote on the silly thing that I do.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But conversely, I just want to cover this really quickly though.

237
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Torment 4 isn't going to be insanely harder than it was before.

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's going to be roughly around Pit Tier 76 is on live right now.

239
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So season 7.

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So think about the game that you're playing right now.

241
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Torment 4 is going to be about 11 Pit Tiers harder.

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So it's still achievable.

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's just that upper end is also just going to be that much harder to sort of climb through.

244
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Awesome.

245
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So we've got a lot of changes coming for like Torment Scaling.

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Obviously some itemization changes.

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So the big thing being as you're leveling up, you're going to see a lot more opportunities to find items.

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Especially with the changes to blue and yellow items there.

249
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And then of course, as you mentioned, the big caveat is like at 60, the item power on Legendaries is still going to be the best method and the best items to actually grab.

250
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So yeah, lots of big changes coming up.

251
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Great to actually walk through all of them.

252
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I know we have a ton more to talk about specifically around the new season.

253
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So thank you, Colin.

254
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We're going to jump over to Derek because I know we do want to talk about the new season and what players are actually going to be experiencing in this PTR.

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Again, just to redefine what PTR is for some people because I got messages from people going like, well, PTRs are sometimes buggy.

256
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And I'm like, well, it's a PTR.

257
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So it is like a beta or an alpha, an early look into a game.

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So we expect that.

259
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There will be like known issues and we'll actually have those known issues on our forums.

260
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So people can actually see them.

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You can report bugs.

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It actually helps when you guys actually jump into a PTR and experience it and give us feedback because that helps tweak the start of the season for the better, essentially.

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But with season eight, we will be having, of course, a PTR and we'll be talking about it here in a second.

264
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:39,000


265
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And really amplify or celebrate or enhance it within that respective season.

266
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So we've seen that with Season Four with the Helltide revamps and whatnot, as you mentioned.

267
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Season seven was the emphasis on the Tree of Whispers and Bounties.

268
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
so as colin kind of mapped out the journey to the end game we wanted to shine focus on a major end

269
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
game uh feature namely surrounding our bosses and we have a lot of really cool bosses in you know

270
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
the world of sanctuary but more specifically the lair boss system or as some of us and we reference

271
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
it to as the boss ladder um so season eight focus is on the lair boss system we're going to be doing

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
a whole mess of new things to it so we're adding new bosses uh new mechanics quality of life

273
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
updates and a revamped materials loop that i'm going to be covering throughout the course of

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
the segment um so you know first i just want to kind of talk about you know the new bosses and

275
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
additions to the roster so when we're talking about the lair bosses these are like the biggest baddest

276
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
you know bosses of sanctuary um so we're looking at how do we add to the roster in a meaningful way

277
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
but also which bosses do we add that are impactful and versatile enough to carry the entire theme of

278
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
a season so with that in mind we're just asking ourselves a question of which of the right bosses

279
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to bring you mentioned an old friend so we had to choose something that was versatile we had to

280
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
choose something that was big bad so that's where we go to belial yes season eight belial's return

281
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
belial's back in sanctuary he is climbing his way to the top of the lair boss ladder he is the new

282
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you know exalted pinnacle challenge within the ladder he is the highest challenge the highest

283
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
reward and he also has some very uh unique reward related uh tricks up his sleeve that i'll cover a

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
little bit later so for now just know that belial's back and he's also just not joining the party alone

285
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
he's bringing a couple of friends from our vessel of hatred so first up is our buddy urvar so urvar is

286
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
joining the roster of the lair boss uh ladder system uh he's going to be filling out kind of like the

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
lowest rung of the ladder so he's going to be joining the party with the varshans and the

288
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
beast of nice and whatnot um so urvar is back and we're also bringing back another vessel of hatred

289
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
uh character the harbinger of hatred i'm so happy for this yeah no this one i love this fight we're

290
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
going to see a little bit more of this guy in just a little bit but uh the harbinger of hatred

291
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
will be joining kind of the second rung of the ladder uh with the likes of duriel and andariel

292
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and one thing i just do want to stress is that both these vessel of hatred bosses will dip into

293
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
the shared loot pools of other bosses within their respective tier but also have some uh additional

294
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
bonuses that is specific to the vessel of hatred like being a great source of tributes and runes

295
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
but belial for all intents and purposes is available to everyone and he is just the new pinnacle

296
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
challenge of the boss ladder so you're saying even harder than duriel and andariel right now

297
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
he's going to be harder more rewarding than even those absolutely yes yeah you're top tier

298
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
yeah new top tier blot lord of lies he does not mess around and i'm really excited about this because

299
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
i think this is going to pair really well with the sort of leveling journey in the torment progression

300
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
where we're making things a little bit more aspirational a little bit more challenging it's

301
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
really like a return to the heart of the diablo experience right sort of leveling from nothing

302
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and taking on these huge big bads to claim their loot yeah absolutely i think that's kind of the

303
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
inherent cool thing about the lair boss ladder system is that you start with like the initiate

304
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
level floor you take those on you graduate to the next level and then now you have kind of belial just

305
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
always there looming over you that's kind of the aspirational yes i get to go fight him now

306
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
um but for those who know about our buddy belial lord of lies you know that he kind of appears in

307
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
different forms so this is what we're kind of referencing is like his supreme form that appears at the

308
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
top of the lair boss ladder but he also has his uh i guess smaller more agile compact form i like

309
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
to effectually refer to him as baby belial but this is belial in his more compact form and throughout the

310
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
course of the season or i guess just the lair boss mechanics he's going to be popping up all over the

311
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
place but i'm really excited about this version of belial's new role in the lair boss ladder system in the

312
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
sense that defeating and looting any of the lair bosses has a small percent chance to initiate a

313
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
surprise ambush from belial himself and this is really cool because this is kind of like a two for

314
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
the price of one payout so let's say i fight and dario i defeat and dario i loot and dario and i get

315
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
this special ambush triggered and if i defeat belial i'll get a double payout of and dario's loot so i

316
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
got the loot from and dario and i get another payout of and dario's loot from defeating belial himself

317
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
so it's it's really exciting kind of just like injection of some you know fun novel mechanics

318
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
within the lair boss system that we're doing over and over and over again um so again really excited

319
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
about this update and again in the spirit of teasing kind of the rewards relationship and

320
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
connection that belial has this version of belial has a very special connection to his larger supreme

321
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
form in in the lair boss ladder that i'll touch upon a little bit later a lot of teasing that i'm

322
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
kind of just sending that there's a lot to go over we're gonna lie to everybody yeah we're just kidding

323
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,000
yeah the theme yeah belial's actually not here this is a lie yeah um yeah so so that was that that

324
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
you know the blau ambushes but i also want to talk about um some additional major sweeping updates

325
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that's coming in with just the system as a whole and i want to talk about the summoning materials

326
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
um as we know the way that the system currently functions is you know you go do activities you get

327
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
summoning items you go visit the boss and you plop them in you summon the boss and then you know

328
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
that's kind of just a flow so when we're looking at the lair boss system we don't just look about

329
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
ways that we can add to it we also look about um you know opportunities to you know resolve or reduce

330
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
some frictions or just areas for improvement that we can have with it since it's a very mature system

331
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
we get a lot of feedback that we you know you know diligently ingest and talk about and whatnot on our

332
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
team so when it came to the summoning materials we identified a couple of key points of i guess

333
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
friction that players are currently having with it one is since you have to ante up your summoning

334
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
materials just to summon the boss it's kind of a feels bad moment when you realize that you just

335
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
wasted you know x number of materials to find out that you can't defeat durial like okay that's

336
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
wasting materials back to the loop maybe i'll fight him another week or two depending how fast you are

337
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and it's just generally not a great feeling for for myself or for players and whatnot yeah i definitely

338
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
have run into this where it's like i'm only going to fight the boss when i can guaranteed win

339
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
against it right right so you never actually and how do you know that too until like you know

340
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
travel and error like you never really have that like actual fun fight with the boss where you're

341
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
like oh am i going to lose or not because it's like well i'm just not going to risk it yeah i've

342
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
had at times where i'm like i don't know if my build's quite ready so i'll try to fight a boss

343
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and then i'm like oh this is really tough like i die a couple times i'm like do i really want to keep

344
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
like retrying it yeah because like well i've already invested i'm kind of like i'm kind of committed

345
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
uh so with this new way you know i don't i don't need to invest those right up front i can just go and

346
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and fight them right away and see how how strong i am uh without risking the materials yeah yeah so

347
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
we're going to cover like the specificities of the new system and how it all works a little bit

348
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
but the other kind of pain point that we identified with the current system is also just in regards

349
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
to like the party play i think my little earpiece is coming out of my ear there you go it's a common

350
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
theme on this one yeah the earpiece just pops out all the time um we do it live here um yeah so the

351
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
other element is like just a party play right and as much as we want to kind of like entrust in our

352
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
fellow man and whatnot and engage in the boss rotations and whatnot we have seen you know some

353
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
areas of friction where certain players don't engage in the boss rotations and they don't submit

354
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
their materials like no one watching the stream would ever be guilty of this but that does happen

355
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
it's shocking but it does happen belial is on the other side of the computer yeah i'll definitely pay

356
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
the next rotation yeah and then they leave and they take all their stuff so that was another kind of

357
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
area of friction um that we experienced with the current summoning materials so i think that's kind

358
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
of enough of a preface just to set the tone for where the system is going now that we're introducing

359
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
season eight so so what are we doing what do we i don't know let's find out all right so layer keys

360
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
so summoning materials are effectively being repurposed in their roles as a new item called layer keys

361
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and what layer keys do well i'll just start with this is since there's no more summoning materials

362
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
that just means that effectively all layer bosses are free to summon yeah so if you're not sure if

363
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
you're ready to take on a varshan or a durial just go visit them you know kind of use them as a bit of

364
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
a training dummy to see if you can actually uh you know take them on but what layer keys now do is

365
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
they grant access to the defeated bosses horde or their treasure chest that they drop so now i'll just walk

366
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
you through kind of the new flow imagine this with me so you enter durial's lair you walk up to his

367
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
altar and you just click the altar to summon him again no cost to you you fight durial you defeat him

368
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
out pops his horde and now the shards of agony which is now the lair key you use that to open his

369
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
horde and get all the oodles of loot that you went to go visit him to do yeah and these work like hell

370
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
tight chests so you have to pay in order to get the loot and the only loot or the loot comes for the

371
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
person who pays yeah that's a very important distinction is that now every member in the

372
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
party needs to have the appropriate type and quantity of the lair keys to access the loot in

373
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
the horde and you can still trade your keys with your friends and things like that if you have

374
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
nine nine nine nine you know durial mats you can split them in half and give them to your buddies to

375
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
open the chest yeah absolutely sharing is caring in the system here and then of course if you're really

376
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
lucky you'll get a belial ambush and you can get double loot yeah yeah there you go uh so a lot again a lot

377
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
a lot of new avenues and ways to kind of uh you know experience the system um so we also have the

378
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
stygian stones um so stygian stones in season eight is living a new life now in the sense that we wanted

379
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
to ensure that every boss in the first rung of the ladder our initiate lair bosses the varshans griggers

380
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
beasts of nice lord's ears and ur of ours now that they're all equally relevant to getting you to

381
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
climb to the next rung so in addition to it kind of you can take a screenshot of this chart here i

382
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
won't try and walk through the entire thing but now stygian stones is a drop that can drop from any

383
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
of the initiate lair boss tier here and you can crush them into your lair key of choice for the second

384
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
rung of the lair bosses so let's say i fight grigor i get a stygian stone and i want to go fight

385
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and dario i can just crush that into some and dario keys and again just giving a little bit more

386
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
flexibility and how players actually engage and progress through the lair boss ladder again as we

387
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
know all roads lead to belial lord of lies you know the top of the pinnacle of the ladder at the end

388
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
there's a lot all right final thing here is the item bloat reduction so again with this new system

389
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
we're consolidating all the lair keys to one lair key type per boss so no more kind of managing two

390
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
different materials and so i have enough material i have two of these five of these it's just one

391
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
material per boss we're increasing the item stacking of these to 99 again to cut down on some of that

392
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
bloat and one of my personal favorites here is that we're also normalizing the counts of required

393
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
lair keys per you know boss rank so all the initiate uh tiered bosses they require the same quantity of

394
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
their respective keys so to the graders and whatnot so again it's just cutting down on the total mental

395
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
math and memory uh that is kind of affecting the i guess like on ramping enjoyment of the current

396
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
system yeah and dario only needs one material for example as part of this yeah yeah absolutely so you

397
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
can see in this chart here you have pincushion dolls shard of agony or the stijian stone is kind

398
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
of the wild card that you can crush to any one of them so um let's say if andaro needed four pincushion

399
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
dolls you have three of them but you have one stijian stone you can crush that into a pincushion

400
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:00,000
doll and go get andaro's horde um so all right that was a a pretty big overview and a lot of talking

401
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and charts but i want to take the time to you know throw it over uh to ruben and uh behind the scenes

402
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
here and kind of just get into just what this all looks like as part of this in-game flow

403
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
hello derek how you doing man i'm doing great how are you awesome yeah let me open up the menu for

404
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
you all right cool so in this walkthrough i'm just going to show you kind of uh we're going to show

405
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,000
you rather the new flow to access the lair bosses with a little bit of a sneak peek of the harbinger

406
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
of hatred so one thing i want to just call out real quick is kind of some of the quality of life

407
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
updates that we've taken to just the map presentation and the boss dungeon tool tips themselves and i'll kind

408
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
just go through these kind of itemized order so first all of the boss uh dungeon map icons have

409
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
been uh given a little bit of a a beautiful beautification treatment so they're a little

410
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
bit more bold red and easier to identify against the sea of other icons on the map but now i want to

411
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
talk about the tool tip and i'll just start from the you know top and go make my way down so the first

412
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
quality of life update that we added was just simply printing the name of the boss that lives that

413
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
resides within the dungeon um you know one of the kind of ambiguities that we have the previous uh

414
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
you know version of this uh system was not knowing specifically which boss lives in which dungeon like

415
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
oh who does live in the gaping crevice or who lives in the malignant uh tunnels um so now you can see

416
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
here that the harbinger of hatred lives in the harbinger's den this is probably not the best example

417
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
because who else would live in the harbinger's den uh yeah but he technically does live in every

418
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
single one of them yeah you don't know where he's at uh but yeah so you can see here now you know we

419
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
print the name of the uh lair boss that lives in the dungeon for a little bit easier find uh instead

420
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
of the main body description we also just give a little bit more guidance and information on uh you

421
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
know what the value of defeating this boss is and they're directing players to the fact that they are

422
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
a source of ancestral and mythic unique items um the last two updates here are some of my favorites of

423
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
this is that we also display now the required items uh that you need to access the lair boss's

424
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
hoard if you recall the previous um you know iteration that was not apparent to you so you

425
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
would kind of like waste the time traveling to the boss just to find out that oh i have three or four

426
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
abhorrence heart so i can't fight the boss yet so we wanted to again just smoothen out the access and

427
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
onboarding to the feature and i think my absolute favorite update of all this is you see at the bottom

428
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
we now have the ability to travel directly into the dungeon directly from the map so again no more

429
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
teleporting to the nearest waypoint uh we just pop directly in and just get into it and uh you know

430
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
we have a ruben loading into here and i think this is a great time to just outline i've talked about

431
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
the new bosses i've talked about new mechanics but we have a you know a collection of really great

432
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:59,000
existing lair bosses and one thing that we wanted to take is is an opportunity within the season was to

433
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
also enhance every other lair boss that exists within the system so every lair boss is getting a bit of a

434
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
difficulty spike and new mechanics you know to again freshen up the fights that we've been you know

435
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
knowing and love so if you fought you know the varshans or the durials or even the liliths you know over and

436
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
over and over again all this is in the ptr so definitely worth checking them out again to see

437
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
what's changed and you know how much uh different their experience is yeah durial has some messed up

438
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
surprises yeah durial eats you

439
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:42,000
but again so this is the harbinger of hatred and you know just as a reminder one thing that we do when

440
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
we add a boss to the to the lair boss system is we don't just take the carbon copy you know campaign

441
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
version of it we also take the opportunity to inject some really crazy mechanics so i don't necessarily

442
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
want to you know kind of spoil the surprises of the harbinger of hatred's mechanics here but he does get

443
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
pretty wild this is it this is a spectacle and a half of a fight and i'm really excited to have

444
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
players check it out so um yeah and i think uh i think this is about uh all we might want to show

445
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
of this guy yeah we probably won't go into it we don't want to spoil all the mechanics and everything

446
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
i even though we're kind of also spoiling a little bit of like a rogue build

447
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
you might have noticed some interesting things on rogue which i'll get to in a bit

448
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
it's it's spoil or it's teasing to make it teasing teasing teasing everyone along here

449
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
um but yeah so now that was a sneak peek at the harbinger of hatred we just talked about again

450
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
in case you missed it the all their bosses are getting a boost in both their performance and just

451
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
the mechanics that they have yep um but let's you know we fast forwarded past you know the harbinger

452
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
of hatred's fight so let's imagine a world that you know we fought through the whole thing we killed

453
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
him and let's show off now what to expect from the horde uh loop flow so we have some uh some footage

454
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
here with this very shiny very shiny chest um so we have four important hearts and now we can open

455
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
up the chest again each one of us needs to have it and i mentioned that belial has a chance to surprise

456
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
ambush you after opening any horde and here you go look at this this is meant to be a relatively rare

457
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:23,000
occurrence um but you know this is the the magic of pre-recorded footage we can make the impossible

458
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
happen and in this case again painting the full picture of the scenario you defeated the harbinger of

459
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
hatred you got the horde you opened it you got baby belial you killed him and now you get another

460
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
proc of yeah double the loot double the fun yeah double the loot of what you just essentially got

461
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
with the one time uh payment of the lair keys that you deposited so yeah it really is you know kind of

462
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
a two-for-one sale that belial has for you and if you noticed you might have seen we did keep a bonus

463
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
for party play so while you do have to pay to get the chest and open up the horde we kept a bonus chance

464
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
for loot so we love that people enjoy fighting the bosses as uh parties and we know that that's a fun

465
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
social experience in diablo so what we've done is the hordes themselves will have bonus chances for

466
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
loot when you are in a party and that does scale with party members yep no absolutely so yeah a lot

467
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:21,000
of loot everywhere to give and on the topic at the very top i teased that belial had a very special kind

468
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
of role in the reward structure different from every other boss so defeating the ambush version of belial

469
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
is not just lucrative in the sense that it's a double payout he is also the sole source of the lair keys

470
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
that you need to access his supreme form at the top of the ladder the supreme forms horde so i want to show

471
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:48,000
off now the supreme belial's very green uh chest here so you can see here i it doesn't open up right

472
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
away i have some options so the really cool thing about the supreme belial's horde is that you can set

473
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:03,000
it to mimic the reward drops of any other existing lair boss so let's say if you are trying to do durial

474
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,000
runs to get the special stuff that he has and you can set your belial to drop the durial loot and he will

475
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
do so at an enhanced rate so it's even better than if you just went to go fight durial specifically

476
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
yeah so if you're really targeted farmanine those specific uniques you get you know uh this durial

477
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
this version of uh of belial just gives you a much better chance of doing that as well yeah absolutely

478
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:35,000
and not just that in terms of like his value he also guarantees one ancestral unique drop uh per kill

479
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and he's also a really great source of the infernal compasses so you know for if you want to you

480
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
empower your infernal horde runs and whatnot uh it's never a waste of time to go visit uh the belial

481
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
supreme at the top of the uh the ladder here yeah and this is in torment two and it all scales with

482
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
torment so exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we're so yeah what we're seeing in this footage is just

483
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
torment two so obviously like torment four you would get more loot out of it because you're it's a much more

484
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
more difficult challenge it is much for sure yeah it scales with the torment tears and also if we were in a

485
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
party in this example here we'd get even you know more chances of great stuff out of it as well that's

486
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,000
exactly right um all right cool well that is the lair key and the lair boss i'm just have a lot of

487
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
things to cover here yeah i know we want to talk a little bit about kind of the it's funny because

488
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
people saw it as ruben was on the map because they probably saw a a term like with apparitions and

489
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
everything right yeah there's a lot of teasing in this i know a lot of teasing this is a live build and

490
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
everything's going yeah it's exciting but one thing before we hop into the next day i do want to

491
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
re-establish so that everything that we just talked about as far as what we're introducing to

492
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
the lair boss system and all the mechanics new bosses and whatnot that is permanent that is just how

493
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,000
the system works now so everything is getting introduced in season eight but it's not leaving

494
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
beyond season eight it is just there it'll be an eternal so it will yeah it'll be an eternal that's

495
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
just how the system works what the next segment though is is all the seasonal specific stuff so

496
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
again as adam mentioned you might have seen some uh apparition incursion things pop up so let's get into

497
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:17,000
the first kind of a seasonal related content here oh the top says layer basket okay anyways um we do it

498
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
live uh apparition incursions uh apparition incursions is a new open world seasonal event uh to empower your

499
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
leveling journeys and also kind of just spread the narrative and uh dramas of belial is back on

500
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
sanctuary and he's spreading his own sense of you know twisted realities across the land uh he's always

501
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
in his efforts to try and plunge you know the world of sanctuary into his realm of lies and he's doing

502
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
it through this fast-paced boss rush style event that kind of takes the spirit of you know the open world

503
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
social boss play of the blood maiden and making a really cool kind of uh just really fast-paced you know

504
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
bam bam bam boss rush style events so i think we have some uh some footage here just to put some uh

505
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
yeah some visuals to it so you know this is an area of the world that belial's apparitions are kind of

506
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
overtaking um and throughout the course players are going to be defeating these apparitions to draw out

507
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:20,000
up to two of his apparition bosses this is pulled from a total of 10 potential apparition bosses so each

508
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
time you go through this you'll fight you know two of them kind of randomized so each time should be a

509
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,000
little bit different and all this is leading up to a showdown against belial himself so again it's

510
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
celebrating bosses it's three bosses per um event and the idea for this is that they're up pretty much

511
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
24 7 so we want to just encourage that you know hop on the boss train ride it to the end find the next

512
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
one and just you know go to your heart's content and you know celebration of bosses this season

513
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
really absolutely and what do you get for killing those bosses oh you're gonna get some cool stuff

514
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
colin let's go to the next slide um that kind of uh leads us into the collectible boss powers uh

515
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
our seasonal powers uh spoiled it right there it's already on the slide yeah we're fine so the theme

516
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,000
for uh the the powers theme for season eight is boss powers so belial being kind of like the uh the

517
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,000
illusionary character he is mimicry and whatnot in season eight players will be acquiring the ability

518
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:27,000
to steal and mimic the powers of up to 24 targeted bosses across sanctuary so we have 24 collectible powers

519
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
that are gathered from the first time kill of targeted bosses across the full content from

520
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
level one until the very top so you asked about you know what do the apparition bosses give you

521
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
they're aside from the loot and all that stuff they are also your first source of your first 10

522
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
uh boss powers that make up the magic tiers you can kind of see in this little chart here

523
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
graduating from the apparition uh

524
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,000
uh bosses you now go into the world bosses so each one of our three world bosses have a power

525
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
associated with them and then so to do each of our lair bosses capped off with lilith with her own

526
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
boss power that you can acquire like a ladder in the boss yeah it's definitely celebrating the

527
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
progression journey of bosses from you know the moment you log in to the moment that you're powerful

528
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
enough to take down lilith yeah um below you know below being kind of like the the star of the season

529
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
he's special he gets two powers because that's just how he rules yeah cheating yeah and i think you know

530
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
one of the cool things about this kind of structure it's a very structured power climb so little ambiguity

531
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
of like how do i get the wandering death's power well go fight and kill him it's just that nice little

532
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
structured journey that kind of is a nice little stamp collection just to reward each kind of a tier

533
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
progression that you make across your you know leveling and end game journeys um but that's not

534
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
just the coolest part of it in my opinion here is that it's also just how the powers work this season

535
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
so you can see that we have uh four slots the top slot and three little kind of like supporting slots so

536
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
the really cool thing is that each one of these powers have two sides to them they that activate

537
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,000
depending on which power slot you put them in so you can have up to one main uh one power you can

538
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
have up to one power slot into your main power slots or you can have up to three power slot into your

539
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
modifier slots and i just want to dive into this wandering deaths chest beam example here so if i were

540
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
to slot the wandering deaths power into the main power slot i would actually unlock the full representation

541
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
of his iconic chest beam power so the main powers is activating and unlocking the actual iconic power

542
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
that is representative of the boss we're going to show kind of a little bit of a showcase after this

543
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,000
but that's how that respective area of the power system works the modifier slots though are super are

544
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
cool and powerful in their own right though so let's say i don't necessarily need the wandering deaths

545
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
you know main power for whatever utility purposes i can still get value out of the fact that i

546
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
own it by slotting it into the modifier slots which activates kind of like the side b of it

547
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
which is more of a supporting thing so in this case it's your main power now it empowers your main

548
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
power to instantly execute non-boss enemies um you know when they're within a you know certain threshold

549
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
of life so it's not just uh you know 24 ways to kind of express your uh you know sense of power this

550
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
season it's 48 because each of these powers have you know kind of like two sides to them yeah it's really

551
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
like build your own boss power essentially yeah it's a lot of fun just kind of like mix match slot

552
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
around and see uh you know what what kind of a concoction you come up with and that's something

553
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
that i'm uh particularly interested in going to the ptr is like what are some of the favorite

554
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
combinations or and ideally what are the favorite combinations based off of the circumstance that

555
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
you're going into definitely yeah oh go ahead charles one thing i wanted to that i'm really excited

556
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
about the system is uh in previous um seasonal power systems we sometimes found as you got really high uh

557
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
you know paragon levels your build is like super powerful the the relative impact of of some of the

558
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
seasonal powers was a little lower they didn't really scale with you as well as we really wanted

559
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
to we we've done an update in in this season where these boss powers are going to uh scale with your

560
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
paragon level as you're as you're leveling up and so they actually are going to get more powerful as you

561
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
get more powerful right so the exact number uh that you as soon as you unlock it it you know maybe is not

562
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
the most powerful thing but as you're you're powering up it's it's still going to be relevant to your

563
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
build at every stage of your progression that's really good i like the fact that the powers don't

564
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
kind of just live on their own little island like they get ingrained into the other systems that we're

565
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:40,000
engaging with um so yeah so that's a high level of the of the boss powers for season eight and i want

566
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
to toss it back to ruben for just kind of a little bit of a live showcase of them hey derek thanks for

567
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
all that that was great man yeah i'm excited what do you got for us uh well i get the fun job of

568
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
showcasing all these powers today but i must confess i got my smoothie so i'm a little jacked up

569
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:05,000
today so i'll try not to talk to you i'm thrilled i'm thrilled let's go ahead and open up uh our

570
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
inventory here and you'll notice on the left side a familiar tab is our seasonal tab which is boss powers

571
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
so from this tab is where you'll be kind of interacting with your powers throughout the season

572
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
like derek mentioned you can drag and drop them equip them on the fly there's no penalty

573
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
i think the team and everybody wants you to experiment and have fun with the builds

574
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
you can also upgrade them by hovering over them there's a corresponding button here on pc it's f

575
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
so go ahead and push that to upgrade them and yeah so uh the top slot is your main slot like derek

576
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
mentioned this is where your main powers go and all the bottom ones are your modifier slots so right

577
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
here um you know derek's favorite was the wandering death's chest beam so as a modifier right you can

578
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
execute enemies but as soon as you drag it over here boom now it's a channeled ability and you'll

579
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,000
notice right away it's a prominent beam um yeah it works well with channeled abilities it only works

580
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
with channeled abilities actually and it's kind of cool with densive knives because you can uh adjust

581
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
and do these micro adjustments to kind of maximize the effect on your target just to keep it on them a

582
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
little bit longer yeah and as you can kind of tell we're not necessarily going for subtlety in terms of

583
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the expression of these powers this season i'm dying someone in chat's like goku oh my god

584
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
all right i also we'll just we'll call it real quick just one thing i absolutely love is just the

585
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
uh the animations of the ui itself and you know you slot these little like eyeball socket eyeball

586
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
powers into the little eye sockets and it blinks and um yeah it just is kind of just fun across

587
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the board just engaging with this and pops yeah so what do we got next uh the next one i want to

588
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
showcase is lilis wind of hate just because probably most of us have died to this before

589
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
her spike ability from the ground and it works on almost every skill so you can definitely you can

590
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
see as soon as i dash here i get the spikes with barrage you get the spikes so you can slot in almost

591
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
every build and have fun with it even dance of knives really cool ability there let's see what else we

592
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
got another fun one there's a transformative ability is uh durials burrow so it completely changes your

593
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
evade skill and you burrow underground you deal damage when you go in to the ground and when you

594
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
exit but the real cool thing is you become immune while underground and you can control the direction

595
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
oh that's awesome is awesome yeah that's one of my absolute favorite i love that one you can stand

596
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
still if you like or whatever and it scales as you get more evade charges you get more burrows so i'm sure

597
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
there's a lot of uh especially adding three new bosses with all kinds of crazy effects you know you can now

598
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
dodge them a little bit easier which is great i'm sure there's some good use cases for that yeah and

599
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
even just even just right there i want to just chime in and just say that you know we showed off a power

600
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
that procs off of the evade we showed one that procs off channeling and one that procs off any skills

601
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
like one of the goals going into the design of these powers was to just remove any ambiguity about how

602
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
do i actually proc it we wanted to make it as utility focused and straightforward as possible

603
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
so that players can really easily easily digest and how they work it into their builds yeah that's

604
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
a great point um urvar's bombs is probably my personal favorite as i like making builds and

605
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
interesting builds this definitely supports ultimate builds and as you can see on the screen here it

606
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
lowers your cooldown by five seconds which is great and gives you a nice damage component to kind of top

607
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
off on it so we're playing rogue and uh death trap is an ultimate ability so as soon as i pop it you'll

608
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
see urvar's bombs kind of shoot out and you get that lower cooldown effect as well so it's great

609
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
boom and you get two death traps i wonder how he's doing that that's that's on me that's on me guys uh

610
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:45,000
yeah all the teasing on the stream uh and finally before they play the walk off music i think i could

611
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
showcase uh let's do grigor's lightning square so if you notice lilith skill had like a slight cooldown

612
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
this one scales with your build really well so the more you can cast core skills the more you get these

613
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
iconic kind of lightning strike panels shoot out from your character uh so you can imagine you

614
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
can just go full thunder thunder god here the whole time with your builds so yeah i think that's all i

615
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
can showcase today but i appreciate the time no thank you that was awesome um yeah so again those are

616
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
just like a kind of a sneak peek at just a handful of the powers again uh throughout the course of the

617
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
ptr you'll get to you know experiment engage with all of them and again looking forward to the feedback

618
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and just uh you know just general notes of how you incorporate into your builds and what really

619
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
excites you um so i think that's pretty much the wrap up for all the content coming in season eight

620
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
uh that persists beyond in yeah yeah all the uh the season eight stuff that will be available in ptr for

621
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
players to actually jump into um we're still going to be talking about a few more things as we get

622
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
closer to season eight uh with the launch of um the actual season itself so uh derek thank you so much for

623
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
walking us through everything um and of course with a new season and a new ptr we have a lot of

624
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
changes that are coming to classes specifically like the rogue which we saw so many things yeah

625
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
we can just skip yeah we'll just skip the road there's other classes to talk about yeah so uh charles

626
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
over here is actually going to go through all the class changes that players will be able to experience

627
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and test out during the ptr yeah of course i mean there's tons of new bosses to fight so how are you

628
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
going to fight them right so let's talk about some class updates that are coming uh first i want to talk

629
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
about some updates that are going to affect all classes in some way these are kind of a bit more

630
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
generic uh updates um so talking about ultimate scaling this is something that we introduced in

631
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,000
uh in season seven the current live season where uh as you get to rank five of the ultimate skills

632
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
some of them had mechanics that allowed you to crank up their damage by building different stats

633
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
right so if you got more damage while fortified then your blood wave is going to do more damage for

634
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
instance uh we think that's really cool it enabled a lot of very powerful builds a lot of

635
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
very powerful builds um and so we're looking at uh ensuring that those don't like really eclipse

636
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
every other option in the game we still love that those are powerful builds we love that you're

637
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
playing them we don't want them to be the only option and so with that in mind we're we're looking

638
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
at putting a cap on that scaling you can scale them up to 200 bonus damage which is still a lot

639
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
you're still doing you know like triple damage um but we just want to make sure it doesn't get

640
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
completely out of control with um all the new stats and and some of the scaling coming in from some

641
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
of the seasonal powers uh that could potentially lead those to be uh you know crowding out other

642
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
options of gameplay uh additionally additionally we're looking at uh crowd control this is something

643
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
i talked about on our last uh campfire chat about how we're really looking at the moment to moment

644
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
combat of our game you know like what are you doing like ever like one second to the next and one

645
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
thing that came up a lot was uh sometimes enemies just randomly get crowd controlled they randomly are

646
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
frozen or stunned and you a lot of this comes from some of the what we call incidental crowd control

647
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
as in lucky hit crowd control effects or anything that involves not like oh i pressed a button now

648
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
they're stunned right um and and we we noticed like hey we got a lot of these effects across the

649
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
game in many different places and so we looked at really toning those down specifically in the generic

650
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
spaces i know fist of fate is one of a very popular uh unique item right now for for many reasons uh one

651
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
of them was that uh that kind of free crowd control but that's something that we think wasn't really

652
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
promoting the best moment to moment combat and most engaging flow um so that particular affix has been

653
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,000
changed to uh lucky hit uh apply vulnerable but a lot of the other um uh identity of fist of fate is

654
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
still there as well so it still has you know wide ranges on things it still does random damage and a lot

655
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
of lucky hit chance as well yeah and this this change really puts the value of frost nova and ground stomp and

656
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
it sort of makes those more valuable and satisfying right yeah so so if you really want to get those

657
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
kind of crowd control effects like it's going to be a build choice you're going to have to consciously

658
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
do it and you're going to like like know when it's happening it's not just oh they randomly got stunned

659
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
and you know if they didn't get some maybe you got hit and and that never felt good when it was just

660
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,000
kind of purely random yeah yeah uh additionally this is a something that uh the keen-eyed among you might

661
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
have spied when we were looking at some other stuff we've done a bit of a naming pass on some of the

662
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
damage over time effects um this is no functional change this is just a naming thing um where we

663
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
have things like a physical damage and when it's physical damage over time we call it bleeding uh

664
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and when it's poison we call it poisoning for instance uh we didn't previously have names for shadow

665
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
lightning or cold damage over time uh we would just call it like from shadow damage over time affected

666
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
enemies which was an absolute mouthful um so we've got new uh common terms uh shadow damage over time

667
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
will be called corrupting damage lightning damage over time is shocking damage and cold damage over

668
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
time which we saw with the wandering death chest beam is called frostbite damage uh so that's just a

669
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
terminology thing it still relates uh to those base damage types same as always uh it's just a

670
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
terminology update cleans up the tool tips absolutely yeah all right so let's get on to some of the actual

671
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
class updates uh starting oh we'll just go alphabetically with the barbarian all right so our focus

672
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
on barbarian this season uh is about uh primarily about barbarians core fantasy of being physical

673
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
and hitting enemies with a big weapon right um in the in the past couple seasons a lot of the meta

674
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
builds around barbarian have focused around things like earthquakes or dust devils which are really cool

675
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and and fun but i think they um we we got some feedback that hey i don't really feel like i'm i'm

676
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
hitting enemies with my big weapon i'm just making a tornado that hits them which is not maybe uh me

677
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
fulfilling the the fantasy that you want out of a barbarian your core skill isn't the cool thing

678
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
it's the thing that the core skill spawns right yeah right and that's um it's cool that those exist

679
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
uh but we want to make sure we're also catering to to that you know heavy hitter kind of fantasy

680
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
and so a lot of the updates this season are focused around that uh specifically updates to double swing

681
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
core skill and the twin strikes unique to make that a bit more impactful to actually be hitting

682
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:04,000
uh whirlwind as well um that's getting a a buff and a rework with uh gore's uh it's it's unique

683
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
gore's devastating grips um and then the new unique and legendary this season really talked to mighty

684
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
throw in particular and make that just like the biggest hitting thing let's take a look at those

685
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
uh uniques and the unique and legendary here so we've got the bane of ajaden this is a unique glove item

686
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
and it says that every 12 seconds your next mighty throw is going to detonate all of its pulses

687
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
instantly you know normally mighty throw like pulses over time it's going to do them all at once and

688
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
deal massively increased damage and that's going to pair up very well with the new legendary aspect

689
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
of delayed extinction which causes both mighty throw and steel grasp to gain multiplicative bonus damage

690
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
rather than cooldown from cooldown reduction so if you've got cooldown reduction on your gear or on

691
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
the bane of ajaden for instance that's not going to actually reduce the cooldown it's going to be

692
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
a multiplicative scaler for these skills and so that now you've got a new problem to solve right

693
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
you you uh can't cast these skills quite as often but when you do they're going to hit super hard

694
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and so we've got a video clip of it just deleting a screen so you walk up and they're all gone

695
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
one hit that's all it takes because you've got all these multipliers on your one big hit

696
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
but of course because it doesn't benefit from cooldown reduction that cooldown is going to be

697
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
pretty much locked at that 12 second mark and so you're going to have to find some other way to kind

698
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
of fill the gap in there and you've got a new challenge for your build to overcome

699
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
i'm hoping to see it like uh belial get decked by this i think it is possible that you're you're

700
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
gonna you're gonna melt some bosses with some really big hits it's a great finishing move oh yeah

701
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
all right let's take a look at the druid so for the druid i want to talk a little bit about

702
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
uh one of the meta builds right now is uh revolts around cataclysm and and kind of uh

703
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
snapshotting issues that come up with that and so uh for those of you who don't know what what

704
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
snapshotting basically means is uh for cataclysm which is one of their ultimate skills that has a

705
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
duration so you press the button it's summons a storm around you that lasts for some amount of time

706
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and if you get a lot of that cooldown reduction and you can cast cataclysm a second time before the

707
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:17,000
first one expires currently on on the live game uh the the second cast of cataclysm will keep all of

708
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
the bonuses and like bonus damage effects or guaranteed overpowers or whatever that was

709
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
affecting the first one and that was definitely not intended that is not how uh we wanted that to

710
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
work we didn't want bonuses from one cast kind of instance to carry over to the next cast now this can

711
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
only happen in uh situations where you get that lot of cooldown uh but it was kind of promoting this

712
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
gameplay where it's very feast or famine if you successfully kind of snapshot all the buffs uh

713
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
this build is insanely powerful and if you mess it up or you don't get the snapshot quite right

714
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:58,000
you're actually really weak and that led to to unintuitive gameplay and uh this really um big divide

715
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:04,000
between the best and the optimal and like kind of the average normal case scenario uh so we're

716
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
addressing that where we don't really want to to promote that uh between two different cast

717
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
snapshotting yeah we don't like snapshotting in general right yeah the the kind of snapshotting

718
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
where you you are persisting things between uh different cast instances or equipping gear and then

719
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
unequipping it to to maintain a bonus those are are snapshotting things that we don't think it

720
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
promotes healthy gameplay uh it's unintuitive in a lot of cases you need to read a guide and follow an

721
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,000
exact checklist to do it um that's not something that that we think is is good for the game there

722
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:44,000
are some cases where um you know with cataclysm you know giving the bonus to that whole cat that first

723
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
time you cast it that it you might say it's kind of snapshots for the duration of cataclysm but that's

724
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
intended where it says your next cast does something that's what we want but we don't want that to persist on

725
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:03,000
to multiple casts or or through uh basically infinitely um so that's that's one thing that

726
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
we're adjusting on druid um but we're also looking at at promoting other play styles as well we think

727
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
uh that build is is fun but there's there's other ways to play druid as well uh specifically with

728
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
stoneburst that's the uh the earth core skill uh it was kind of a channeled skill which um from a lot

729
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,000
of our channeled skills they are not allowed to overpower um but with stoneburst particularly we

730
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
have reworked one of its legendary items to allow it to overpower when you detonate it at maximum size

731
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:37,000
which is really cool and opens up to new build possibilities for stoneburst and finally want to

732
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
talk about uh the new unique uh gathlin's birthright uh this is a let's take a look at it on screen here

733
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,000
um it's in a similar vein to tempest roar and vasilius prayer where it is a unique helm that is very

734
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,000
transformational but rather than talking to werewolves or werebear built it's talking to human

735
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
form builds if you just you don't want to uh you don't want to embrace the wilds quite as much you

736
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
want to stay in your human form gathlin's birthright is going to be the unique helm for you it says while

737
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
you're in human form critically striking enemies with your nature magic skills will grant you anima of

738
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
the forest for 10 seconds and when you get great uh whenever you gain anima of the forest you are

739
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:20,000
infused with bonus key passives perfect storm and earth and might so if you have this and you have

740
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
another key passive you can potentially have up to three key passives active at once which is not

741
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
something we've ever done before in diablo 4. that's nutty and i love that it's on the helm so if you

742
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
really want to be a human druid which historically you know hasn't been as great as like werewolf for

743
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,000
example this is the home for you yeah this is exactly uh exactly that it's in a similar spot as like

744
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
hey this is build defining in the way that tempest roar is for werewolves we want this to be the build

745
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,000
defining helm for human form druids uh additionally aspect of impending deluge that empowers your storm

746
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
strike which is probably pretty useful with this human form nature magic build uh which will cause

747
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
your storm strike to deal more and also increase damage they take from your other skills for a time

748
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
i think we've got a picture of this or a video of this in action where you've got your uh druid it's got

749
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
you uh you need 200 stacks of anima of the force which sounds like a lot but it triggers on every

750
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:17,000
hit so in most combat situations you actually stack it up pretty quick and see once you get this online

751
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:23,000
you're going to be empowered with earth and might and with perfect storm and with nature's fury you have

752
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:29,000
all of this power and the idea of three three passes going at once is the the key passes is crazy yeah

753
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
yeah boss power slapped on top of that too oh yeah it is it is a lot uh when you when you get this empowered

754
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:43,000
state all right moving on to uh one of my favorite classes the necromancer um so necromancer was

755
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
probably the talk of the current season season seven uh with blood wave i know we've mentioned

756
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
it a few times on stream uh blood wave really good um we we've talked about how we uh we're going to

757
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
look at ultimate scaling so maybe it won't scale up with the bonus damage at least not to the the same

758
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
level that it had before we're going to put a cap on that um we also just think we we generally overshot

759
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
the mark on uh the the unique item the kesemi's legacy which really like you get this item and

760
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,000
suddenly you're a god it it just had so much power in one spot um and and we like a bit more of that

761
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
progression that colin was alluding to before about that zero to hero journey and when you have one

762
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,000
item that is you equip it and it's over like you're as powerful as you ever need to be um that really

763
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:33,000
shortcuts that journey and really makes it feel um less satisfying than than we want uh so we're

764
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
looking taking a look at reducing the power of that unique in particular as well some other adjustments

765
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
to blood wave uh we do want blood wave uh builds to still be powerful and still be an option if you

766
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
like that play style we just don't want it to be the s plus plus tier that it was in the past

767
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
additionally we're taking a look at blood lance this is a core skill that has historically been very

768
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:01,000
good in in multi-target kind of uh clearing out uh pit runs or dungeon situations but then you run up

769
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
into a boss which hey we're fighting a lot of bosses this season yeah uh and it suddenly falls really

770
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:11,000
flat because its core mechanic is about uh like arcing damage between enemies and if there's only one

771
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
enemy what are you doing here right um so with this update to blood lance it's going to uh still

772
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
maintain some of that fantasy where it arcs the damage between enemies but if you're hitting a target

773
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
who's already lanced it's going to do a massive amount more damage so it's a much better in single

774
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,000
target situations and much more viable for bossing and finally the new legendary and unique for the

775
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:39,000
season talks to minions so let's take a look at sanguivar blade of zeer the unique two-handed sword

776
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:46,000
so this weapon uh will empower your summons so so your minions and your army of the dead to affect

777
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
enemies with vampiric curse now for those of you played back in season two uh vampiric curse was a

778
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,000
mechanic that we introduced in in the season of blood where you affect enemies with it and as you

779
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,000
kill them you kind of collect their soul and then you can unleash these souls they they kind of run out

780
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
from you and explode and it's really satisfying moment and we we put that on a handful of legendary

781
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
aspects but now all of your summons will affect enemies with vampiric curse and you can unleash them

782
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
with army of the dead and when you do that the this uh the souls from vampiric curse and army of the

783
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
dead itself will deal massively increased damage scaling with how many souls you've collected

784
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
it's huge i love minion necro it's like my favorite oh yeah yeah this this is really cool um for for

785
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:36,000
army of the dead and and minion necro um to just really be that that impactful moment of of summoning

786
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:42,000
an army of of uh of skeletons to just eviscerate the enemies and additionally uh aspect of service

787
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
and sacrifice i love playing with this one this one feels so good to play your your skeleton warriors

788
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
explode on death dealing a massive chunk of physical damage to surrounding enemies and to help make sure

789
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
they die they lose 25 life per second while in combat so you're going to be needing to resummon

790
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
them quite often but when you do hey it's good because they're going to be detonating for this massive

791
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
chunk at the end and additionally while you're resummoning all your warriors your mages are going to be

792
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
super tanky they're going to take 90 less damage and deal massively increased damage so you're going

793
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
to have your mages up pretty much all the time and you're going to be focusing on resummoning the

794
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,000
warriors to to run in there and explode and and do their damage that way that's awesome it's a really

795
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
clever way to make it feel like you're constantly summoning and you have your back line of uh mages just

796
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
obliterating yeah it's great let's take a look at sanguivar blade of zeer in action here uh oh no sorry this

797
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
is actually service of and sacrifice um so you've got your skeleton warriors the the skirmishers they

798
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,000
run up there um and then here's blade of zeer right you get all those like skeleton warriors running out

799
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
when you activate army of the dead not you you just get the the normal ones that are are running around

800
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:58,000
but then they all uh you unleash a stream of them uh straight from you uh with uh the uh with the

801
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:06,000
with the sanguivar really impactful um ultimate skill there yeah army of the dead is just so

802
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,000
underutilized so i'm so happy to see it come back into the fold it's great all right um next up we've

803
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
got the one we've been teasing for a bit thank you ruben uh the rogue let's take a look at uh the idea

804
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
with rogue so as you probably guessed the theme of rogue this season is looking at trap builds uh right

805
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,000
with both death trap and poison trap in a way uh historically poison trap has been kind of

806
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,000
underrepresented um death trap builds have been quite popular pretty powerful and and a lot of

807
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
fun to play uh poison trap uh kind of fell by the wayside a little bit um it had a number of issues

808
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
that we're looking to address this season um to really promote poison trap as a viable standalone build

809
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and uh what we're seeing um from from ruben was the scoundrels leather rework now this is a unique

810
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
chest item that's been in the game for a while it was about traps in the past uh we've done a rework

811
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:02,000
this season where when you cast a trap uh or rather every 10 seconds when you cast the trap you're

812
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,000
going to get a bonus death trap so you could cast poison trap or caltrops or death trap itself and then

813
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,000
you get a second death trap and when you actually cast uh the death trap active button you're going to

814
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,000
to kind of jump or teleport to that position so you can just instantly get uh get into the fray there

815
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
oh that's cool yeah so it you know rogues are all about mobility and jumping around the battlefield

816
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
and and uh doing that kind of thing this is just another tool in their arsenal to really jump in

817
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
put the death trap down which groups up some enemies and then they're ready for you to slaughter

818
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:41,000
there um but let's take a look at the new items that talk to poison trap specifically uh the bands of

819
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,000
icarus rose these are unique gloves that says uh your poison trap is which normally has a nine second

820
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
duration it's always going to do its full damage over three seconds instead so it's much shorter

821
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:58,000
duration but higher dps and it's always going to benefit from all of its upgrades you know that

822
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
enhancement and those those modifications you just get all of them you don't need to put skill points

823
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,000
in and normally the the two choices are mutually exclusive you get both with these and they're going

824
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
to be even more powerful additionally poison trap will now also benefit from your combo points if you're

825
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
using those it's going to have no cooldown during the inner sight if you're using inner sight and if

826
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
you're using preparation its cooldown is going to be reduced by the preparation trigger so previously

827
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:28,000
poison trap didn't really interact with any of these three mechanics very well and now it benefits from

828
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
whichever one you want that's so cool so it really makes it more like a core skill something i can

829
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
work into my rotation oh yeah yeah you're going to be wanting to use this very often with this uh with

830
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,000
this unique and then the aspect of contamination as many builds that focus around poison on

831
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
rogue often uh want to build critical strike damage because that's really good with the poison

832
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:55,000
imbuement poison trap um now also can scale up with some critical strike chance so it uh with aspect of

833
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
contamination it unleashes a poison burst when it detonates like kind of initial upfront hit and then

834
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
if that burst critically strikes which you know if you're building a lot of crit chance it probably will

835
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
or if you hit a lot of enemies then you're going to deal increased poison damage for a duration which

836
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
will of course increase the rest of the duration of the poison trap and uh this is probably my

837
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:22,000
favorite clip here let's get a clip of this one um right so you you uh apply poison trap which uh

838
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,000
it's going to throw two of them out and one of its upgrades knocks down enemies and because it's

839
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
increased it knocks them down for quite a while and so they just uh take a little nap in your poison

840
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:41,000
traps uh i don't recommend it but hey if it any if they do they take a ton of poison damage i love the

841
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
knockdown animation of this kind of enemy yeah this guy uh just just falls right down

842
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,000
lay down i guess the face his face is in it his face plants and uh and then succumbs to the poison

843
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:03,000
so it's awesome all right uh moving on we've got our sorceress uh so the sorceress class uh definitely

844
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
is one of the ones uh currently on season seven that i think didn't have any of these real big

845
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,000
outlier builds that we'd kind of talked about some of the the highest highs come from like the blood

846
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:20,000
necro um or or uh the the druid with the snapshotting uh cataclysm uh and i think i definitely want to

847
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
acknowledge that you know sorceress maybe didn't have some of those those real outliers this season

848
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,000
and they were maybe felt like they were a bit behind of those so as we talked about with other

849
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,000
classes we're definitely looking at bringing those outlier builds down a notch to to bring them kind

850
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,000
of uh back to to the norm of of some of the other builds so they're not so far ahead um but for

851
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
sorceress we're looking at at improving some of the uh the quality of life and some of the the

852
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
interactions between some of their mechanics like crackling energy meteors and meteorites and making

853
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,000
sure they scale well with the build um like crackling energy will now have the shock skill

854
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
tag so if you're building up damage for shock skills or some of the other synergies there those now

855
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
interact with your crackling energy and additionally with meteor and meteorites they're not going to be

856
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:16,000
able to scale with each other's damage which helps builds just be a bit more cohesive and and feel more

857
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:24,000
uh robustly supported um that being said i think where sorceress has been um in season seven is um in

858
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
terms of like its power progression and and the the relative strength of its builds uh amongst each

859
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:37,000
other is is more of the the closer to the ideal state of where we envision all classes ending up

860
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
um we we recognize that that they are kind of a bit lower uh than other classes in season seven

861
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
um but we're looking at bringing them up a little bit with improved quality of life and build options

862
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and making sure that some of the outlier builds that's really skewing that perception are are being

863
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:59,000
brought to be um to to bring them close together yeah and create some more harmony between the classes

864
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
exactly yeah yeah and i think this is something that we're actively looking at again to the point of

865
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,000
early in the season if things aren't really performing to the level of our expectation and it doesn't feel

866
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
good then those are things that we're going to buff and sorceress is a great example of like what

867
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
we're going to be really looking at yeah yeah and and we want to do that in ways that that make

868
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
we don't just want to slap on a 50x scaler on sorceress we want to make sure that the builds feel

869
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,000
cohesive and coherent in a way that makes a lot of sense um and so that's what all the bulk of our

870
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,000
focus is for sort uh this season uh specifically want to talk a little bit about um ice shards uh that's

871
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,000
what the uh the new unique uh is going to be uh working with here let's take a look at the unique

872
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:48,000
the hail of virglass uh this is a unique helm that's going to empower your ice shards to spread out

873
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
rather than shoot in kind of a straight line that kind of rapid fire uh it's now going to be a spread

874
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
pattern you can hit more enemies with it and you get bonus shards and you're going to be dealing

875
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
increased damage for every time and ice shards damages an enemy and it's going to stack up uh so it

876
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
takes a lot of stacks you need to be spamming ice shards you need to be hitting a lot but once you

877
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:13,000
do it it unleashes a lot of bonus uh damage and also it just makes the skill in my opinion a lot more

878
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,000
usable right i like the spread pattern a whole lot um unless you hit wider screen and you can kind of

879
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
like shotgun enemies if you get nice and close to them that's cool and uh shivering aspect a new uh

880
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
legendary aspect here uh enemies are going to take increased damage based on how much they're chilled

881
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
or staggering now historically uh some of the the frost sorcs or some of the other builds that

882
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
were heavy on those crowd control effects sometimes they really struggled into to bosses which hey

883
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
bosses are the theme of the season it's very appropriate um so so we're making sure that that

884
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,000
some of these new effects that that uh scale based on the crowd control effects also work against bosses

885
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,000
so this will kind of uh take how much stagger you've built up on the boss and also give you a bonus

886
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
damage based on that uh so so really being cognizant of hey let's make sure this works in the situations

887
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
you want it to and it's not night and day oh i'm clearing trash mobs and then i hit the boss and

888
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
and you just feel so different uh we want to make sure that's a bit smoother of an experience between

889
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:16,000
the two uh ways of playing all right let's take a look at the hail of virglass with these new ice shards

890
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
in action right so they they fire out pretty quick they fire out in a nice spread and uh you can

891
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
clear through whole packs of skeletons with with a single cast here multi-shot oh yeah

892
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:34,000
multi-shot with ice shards yeah oh yeah all right and moving on to our final class here the spirit born

893
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,000
uh so the spirit born uh was in a pretty good state i mean similar to to sorceress where it didn't have

894
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,000
those crazy overpowered builds but we think it's it's in a relatively um healthy spot and we're just

895
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
looking at empowering new build options and making uh tighter synergies between the builds and and

896
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
giving you some new tools to play with uh with that in mind we took a look at rushing claw it's one of

897
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
my favorite skills on the spirit born but never really found its way into any of the most popular

898
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:08,000
builds um in the past couple seasons since spirit born was released um and we we've updated the the uh

899
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,000
the two upgrade choices to be uh kind of transformative it's kind of a if you pick one upgrade the

900
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
the current one um russian clause has four charges and so when you use a charge you kind of quickly

901
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:26,000
dash through an enemy and so you have four charges you can spam it four times real quick um the other

902
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:34,000
upgrade now uh has been reworked where it gains even more charges it gains 12 charges but using it consumes

903
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
all the charges so really it has just one but for every charge that it consumes it deals massively

904
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,000
increased damage and it hits a wider area so now gaining cooldown reduction or gaining more charges

905
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
actually just increases your damage output and and it promotes a very different play style uh for this

906
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
so you get kind of an option you can choose the original version uh which is still very powerful and

907
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
very cool uh or you can choose the new upgrade and kind of spend all your charges at once do a big kind

908
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:07,000
of damage cooldown and then work on building up those charges again to deal even more uh additionally we

909
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
we've looked at uh storm feathers and specifically how they interact with the new unique item the sunbird's

910
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:21,000
gorget which i think we've got a a picture of right here so the sunbird's gorget is a new unique amulet

911
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:27,000
this really uh works to synergize with the eagle and jaguar builds so it says picking up a storm feather

912
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
which you can create in many different ways will form a firestorm around you for eight seconds that

913
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
deals fire damage and every additional storm feather that you pick up is going to intensify

914
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
this firestorm it's going to make it grow in size up to a maximum and then it's going to increase its

915
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
damage output for as many storm feathers as you can spawn this firestorm is going to get more intense

916
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
but it only lasts for eight seconds so intensifying it or picking up more storm feathers it's not going

917
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
to extend the duration so it's kind of locked to that eight second duration and then it'll reset so you

918
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
really want to collect as many storm feathers as possible in eight seconds and then and then it

919
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,000
restarts and also that this firestorm is considered an igua an eagle jaguar and storm feather skill so

920
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
you've got lots of options for how you want to increase this damage through your other talent

921
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,000
choices or your itemization uh you got lots of options for for how to work this into a build in

922
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:26,000
either eagle or jaguar or both and uh following up on the theme with rushing claw we've got the new rip and

923
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,000
tear aspect where rushing claw is going to deal increased damage and is empowered based on how

924
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:37,000
many charges you had when you cast it so if you're taking the upgrade that gives you 12 charges it's

925
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
probably always going to be with four plus and so it's going to strike an additional time but if

926
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
you're choosing the option where you spend each charge as you go it's going to go through a bit of

927
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
a cycle here you're going to get an additional strike then it's going to get a guaranteed crit then it's

928
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
going to get a guaranteed overpower and when you just have one charge left it's going to give you a nice

929
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,000
chunky heel to help keep you in the fight nice there's a ton of versatility in there yeah yeah

930
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
lots of different ways to play and it works great with with either way uh that russian claw now works

931
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
all right let's take a look at the sunbird's gorget in action here right so you're moving along

932
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
you're picking up tons of these feathers and the firestorm around you just grows in intensity

933
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
uh you've got lots of different ways to to scale it up and it provides a nice kind of passive aoe

934
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
around you as you're picking them up and you're really going to want to make sure you're you're

935
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
kind of uh thinking about exactly how your character is moving to make sure picking up as

936
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
many of these storm feathers as possible to maximize your damage output

937
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
all right that's um that's a lot we got a lot of new class content coming for every class uh we did

938
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
get through all of them um but yeah i'm really looking forward to seeing all the new builds that uh

939
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
that these empower how they modify old existing builds and and all the interesting combinations that i'm

940
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
sure all of you will test out on the ptr and find out the most absolutely broken thing and let me

941
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,000
know about it yes please let us know if you find something absolutely broken which i'm sure you will

942
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,000
so thank you again charles uh for walking us through all the different class changes again this is uh we

943
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,000
do plan on having uh patch notes along with the blog related to everything uh tied to ptr so there's

944
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:16,000
other changes that we didn't actually cover off in here uh that will be on the uh diablo4.com immediately

945
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
after the stream um so everyone can actually check it out inspect it you know do their theory

946
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
crafting and everything uh related to that of course with ptr uh we kind of want to know when ptr

947
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,000
actually begins uh ptr is starting next tuesday uh and this is of course ptr on pc battle net uh so

948
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,000
players will be able to jump in uh starting on the 11th and it'll run for a week there i will note that

949
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:45,000
players actually will be able to also pre-download the ptr uh the day prior so around monday afternoon

950
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:52,000
here in california um i translate that using some sort of time tool uh that will be when players will

951
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:58,000
be able to uh pre-download so it'll be about a day beforehand um one thing to note is um of course the

952
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:05,000
boost vendor uh mrak will be available which will be dancing in in town for everyone but one thing we did

953
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
want to note is that the boost themselves will be available probably two days after the ptr actually

954
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
begins um the reason behind this is actually a little bit tied to how season seven performed

955
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,000
uh one thing we allowed players to do was immediately boost um the second they got into ptr and we really

956
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
didn't get that whole entire flow as we were kind of going through the headhunt and things like that so

957
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:33,000
we also just want to hear your feedback on the leveling process right this is why we run the ptr

958
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,000
uh we really want to hear your thoughts on how the sort of uh more uniform leveling feels how the

959
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:44,000
legendary drop rates feel so that is really valuable to us uh for launching a really awesome season eight

960
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,000
exactly yeah and so after a couple days mrak will be more than happy to take your paragon levels to uh

961
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:57,000
insane numbers so ptr boost will be available just a couple days after uh that one other thing i do want

962
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:03,000
to note is um we will of course have our forums available and online uh for ptr that is the best

963
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
place to actually provide feedback of course we do look in other places such as reddit discord etc

964
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,000
but i will say like the forums is kind of we turn them on specifically like a ptr section so please put

965
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,000
feedback in there because we are constantly checking in there for uh any notes feedback from players on that

966
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:27,000
end uh one other note is within the ptr you guys may see a term called the reliquary uh that may just

967
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,000
kind of pop up uh here and there and you we haven't talked about the reliquary nor will the blog later

968
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
today actually be talking about the reliquary um i will say that you guys will hear more about the

969
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:46,000
reliquary before the start of season eight in itself um but for right now uh ignore it i don't know turn a

970
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:52,000
blind eye i don't know uh but it is a um rework of our battle pass system that we're doing we're

971
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,000
trying to uh we we've heard a lot of comments from players related to the battle pass trying to make

972
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
it a little bit more customizable for people especially for rewards that they're looking for

973
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,000
so we'll have a detailed breakdown of what the reliquary is before season eight so uh looking forward

974
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:14,000
to kind of sharing that uh before we actually kick off this season and i know i have a lot i'm trying

975
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
to get through all my stuff and i know it's like i'm hungry um the um uh the last thing we do want

976
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
to talk about is i've gotten asked a million times about this and i've even seen it in chat uh and

977
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:32,000
it's related to a roadmap uh for diablo 4 and i will say that uh we are actively working on a roadmap that

978
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:39,000
we can share with you all uh which is great because it gives you and and everyone a a uh opportunity to

979
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,000
kind of see more of like the future vision of what's coming for diablo 4. um we do plan on actually

980
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,000
having this roadmap out before season eight um so we're really excited to share it so as soon as we

981
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,000
actually do have that available we of course will you'll you'll hear it everywhere uh we will be on

982
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
every single microphone and megaphone out there showcasing uh what the the roadmap is and you've

983
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,000
probably seen roadmap if you're curious like what what does a roadmap entail you've probably seen some of

984
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
our uh fellow uh teams here at blizzard such as like diablo immortal or like world of warcraft they've

985
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,000
actually posted uh these more public facing roadmaps and that's something that we want to do here

986
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
so that you guys have that uh ability of being able to see what what's coming up for diablo 4 and and

987
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:28,000
more exciting news related to it so um i know we have q a we want to jump into q a here really quickly

988
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
uh so if you guys do have any questions or anything of course we have our chat available on

989
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
uh the twitch uh link for diablo so feel free to jump in and and ask any questions um i know we

990
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
uh we always queue it up with one question specifically and uh do we have a question slide

991
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
here there we go uh how does party play work with layer bosses we kind of covered this a little bit but

992
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,000
i don't know if you guys want to go into specifically more details on this um yeah i can jump into that so

993
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
when you are fighting the layer bosses uh in a party and the horde the horde spawns when you open the

994
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,000
horde we essentially do a bonus chance for an extra drop based on the amount of party players

995
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:11,000
uh party play so if you're in a party of four and you open up that horde it's going to guarantee an

996
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,000
extra unique item so it scales with the amount of parties or party members you have and it's always

997
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:23,000
a good time you know when you get together with people awesome um i'm like i'm so unprepared all right

998
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
let me look through the questions here as uh people are dropping in questions i have a team of people

999
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
dropping questions to it if you're ever wanting to know how we do this we just have a google doc and

1000
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:38,000
we're copying and pasting questions from chat into there so um very high tech like super high tech um

1001
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,000
let's see this is from skulm tv any plans to place a blacksmith or vendor near the boss rooms

1002
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
to help people quickly salvage clear inventory without having to go into town

1003
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,000
um i think this is something that we can definitely uh take away and consider especially with the revamp flow

1004
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
that's definitely something that's interesting one thing that the revamp flow does i will touch on

1005
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,000
is the amount of chain bossing really requires you to have a lot more materials if anything you know

1006
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
sort of some philosophy here is we've heard a lot of feedback that it feels mandatory to play some of

1007
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,000
these bosses in a party just because chain bossing is so lucrative and we do expect some amount of the

1008
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
chain bossing to come down a little bit because a lot more of the resources are being consumed when

1009
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,000
opening those chests so um it's not a direct answer to your question i think it's an interesting

1010
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
idea but i do think the amount of chain bossing and required trips and flow breaks to go back to

1011
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
town from some of this bossing is going to come down a little bit especially been playing if you've

1012
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:45,000
been playing a ton of party awesome uh question from uh fan 27 uh q a or sorry he wrote diablo q a and i

1013
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:52,000
just read that out loud uh any chance we will have to redo strongholds and waypoints on every character

1014
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,000
every single season uh i can answer that one too yeah this is something uh i definitely experience

1015
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
it's always a big pain in the ass where it's like oh there's some cool bounty or apparition incursion but

1016
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
i have to go get the waypoint um it's something the team has been talking about there's no concrete

1017
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
plans today which i know is disappointing but it's something we know is a problem and something we 100

1018
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:18,000
want to tackle in the near future awesome uh jokums uh says uh would you this is actually a question

1019
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
that um you know we were talking about that might actually come up but like would you consider adding

1020
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:29,000
the frog from which powers uh in season seven as a permanent companion skill for druids and uh at the

1021
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:35,000
moment i can say we're not uh for that specifically but uh it is a thing that i think we we didn't really

1022
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:41,000
clarify in regards to what from season seven is kind of like for sure staying over um i i will say

1023
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:48,000
like the the witch powers uh are are most definitely like something that um aren't carrying over completely

1024
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:54,000
over to to to the future seasons but one thing in regards to at least the the um tree of whispers

1025
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:01,000
is that like we have a bunch of new npcs there we redid the layout there that is uh made that as a hub that

1026
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
doesn't feel like i'm just going for the tree and i have to like immediately leave uh it's it's made

1027
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,000
it as like a all-encompassing place that you can most definitely tap into from that end yeah oh go

1028
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
ahead i can speak a bit to you know the seasonal powers i as we said that a lot of those witchcraft

1029
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
powers are specific to season seven that is true they are not necessarily coming back um in in season

1030
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
eight but but we do hear that feedback right i think they got a really positive reception a lot of like

1031
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:30,000
the poison frog one of my favorites you know fire bats and all kinds of other things that are um very

1032
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
visually flashy and just a lot of fun to play with uh we hear that and and that definitely helps us

1033
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
to inform like making future content in the past we've done that where we've taken some some favorite

1034
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:46,000
seasonal mechanics put them on items to return i can't speak to any particular plans but just know

1035
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,000
that we do hear this feedback and it'll definitely help us to to help craft um content in the future

1036
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
um we got a lot of questions related to ptr because i know um as i mentioned this is a pc battle net ptr and

1037
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:06,000
there there's a few people like um kim from canadia and i can't read this because the the text color is

1038
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:13,000
so just jarring uh but the um uh we've gotten a lot of questions related to ptr being on pc battle net

1039
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
asking like hey is there any plans of bringing it to console maybe steam i'll say the reason why

1040
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:26,000
pc battle net works best for us is that um battle net is a platform that is housed here at blizzard and is

1041
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:32,000
the the processes of getting builds up there making like any type of change especially for ptr where

1042
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:39,000
we're in a smaller window uh and we may need to change something really quickly uh just it gives

1043
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
us more flexibility and allows us to be able to change those things really really smoothly um i know

1044
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,000
with other platforms and everything there's more processes involved for for good reason because they

1045
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
you know they have more checks and balances and everything um so it makes it a little bit more

1046
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
difficult on our end to do some of those fast iterations that we may need with ptr so in the

1047
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:05,000
foreseeable future right now we see pc battle net as being kind of the home for ptrs when we do and

1048
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:13,000
end up testing anything um question from uh my computer is telling me to update it's been telling me for

1049
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:21,000
weeks um don't hate me it uh chris mate says will the lair bosses have resilience slash damage reduction

1050
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
that the world bosses have to ensure that they just don't get one shot too fast with some classes

1051
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
or builds trivial trivial trivial i did that i can't talk today trivializing yeah i can't even talk i

1052
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,000
think this is a great question it's something we actually talk about on the team uh a bunch and you

1053
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:43,000
know from our perspective uh adding something like resilience would sort of devalue that power

1054
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:49,000
progression like we feel like it sort of disservices that sort of zero to hero once belial was really hard but

1055
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
now i've gotten so strong i can just crush him that said we do think that the level of one-shotting

1056
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
bosses that has been happening is a little bit too much there isn't enough of a journey to get to a

1057
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:05,000
point where i can just stomp on varshaw or i can stomp on the pennant tonight um so what we have done

1058
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,000
is like derek mentioned earlier in the stream we've massively buffed a lot of these bosses like so much so

1059
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:17,000
they were kind of like try it on the ptr and see uh but a lot of these bosses should present more of a

1060
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
journey to getting to a place where you can really stomp on them throughout the torment tiers

1061
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
um even uber lilith herself has been um or i don't remember what we actually call it echo

1062
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:33,000
echo we just keep calling her we're literally now it's just stuck yeah um has seen quite a buff

1063
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
and that should mean that that journey to getting to a place where you're really farming some of

1064
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
these bosses is a lot more fulfilling but it's longer also you're not just like walking into

1065
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
torment one and one-shotting varshaw yeah and that kind of ties into what i talked about with some of the

1066
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,000
outlier builds that we're just like blood wave macro prime example of of being something where

1067
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:56,000
you get one item and then suddenly you can one shot everything uh it's really not it doesn't promote

1068
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,000
the best gameplay like it's just like it's fun for a little bit to go in and one shot everything but

1069
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
um that's that's something we we think it's it's much more engaging to to have a little bit of back

1070
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
and forth and you're not just going in and stomping them but you are you do feel powerful uh feel some

1071
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,000
power progression and as you get more powerful and more gear and more paragon levels you do get

1072
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
more powerful and becomes easier to overcome these challenges and then you start feeling that real

1073
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,000
powerful stuff as you really complete your build yeah and i'll also say like i think part of how we

1074
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,000
originally set up the boss ladder it really did encourage the one-shotting behavior right like if

1075
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
you have to pay materials to fight this boss why would you ever fight the boss when it's actually a

1076
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,000
challenge right you would only fight it when it's really difficult but the changes that we've made have

1077
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,000
really sort of you know in a fun way i'm hoping uh this plays out that you can sort of maybe get a

1078
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,000
cheeky run in on varchan when maybe he's really hard but you get a really powerful unique um because

1079
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
you don't have to risk anything anymore when to actually summon him yeah i think it also kind of

1080
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
speaks to just the approach of injecting challenge across the lair bosses like we discussed you know

1081
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
we could just do straight stat boosts and that would definitely resolve it but within season eight the

1082
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,000
team took the extra opportunity to also just inject new mechanics and updated mechanics to the lair

1083
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,000
bosses across the board to introduce that hiked challenge but in an interesting way that's just

1084
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:25,000
more fun i guess really for us to enjoy um we have a question related to uh i'm going to speed through

1085
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:32,000
a few last questions here um lilith will will lilith ever make a entry into maybe the boss layer system

1086
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
or anything this is from ganon north yeah i think uh that's something that we've been thinking about and

1087
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
like what's the right place and what's the right time for something like that um she's in an

1088
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
interesting spot now where she's kind of like the pinnacle of the season's journey a lot of times and

1089
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
that's something we can definitely think about especially with this revamped flow of being able

1090
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,000
to summon the bosses um so we can definitely take that into consideration that'd be a lot of fun

1091
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,000
um quick question related to the spirit born this is from the schwab uh does the new russian claw aspect

1092
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:07,000
power give you all the previous bonuses at four plus charges or just the extra cast uh it's just the extra one so it

1093
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,000
it's um so if you're casting it at four or more charges it only hits an extra time it does not get

1094
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:19,000
guaranteed crit or overpower uh or heal you it's uh you kind of either progress through one benefit at

1095
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:25,000
a time or you just get the four plus if you're using uh the new upgrade uh i'm gonna do two quick

1096
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:31,000
last questions i will end on the one that everyone's asking i see it in chat don't worry uh the uh in regards to

1097
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:40,000
um i lost it there it is uh from mid central vowel uh at what point will you start maybe potentially

1098
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:45,000
removing uniques that have proven to be not that useful um or do you guys feel like uniques are

1099
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:55,000
feeling bloated in this in the current setup i i think um i actually feel like we don't necessarily

1100
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
have enough uniques in terms of speaking to every skill like i think that's something that you see with

1101
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:05,000
the poison trap and you see with ice shards um that is sort of why we have the boss ladder to give

1102
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
you more deterministic or maybe not deterministic but targeted ways to find some of the uniques

1103
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
you're looking for this lets us have a lot of different uniques but things that you actually have

1104
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,000
to target um the other thing i'll just say too is like part of the game is random items and figuring

1105
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
out how to assemble a build out of the random items so like we don't want to get to a place where

1106
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,000
i just sort of log into diablo and i get all the uniques i want and then i'm sort of done with the

1107
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,000
game and it's just sort of this linear deterministic track through getting the pieces that that you

1108
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,000
want um but that said like we're always sort of listening to the feedback and if it does start to

1109
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
feel like where i'm just constantly sifting through things i don't care about those are things that we

1110
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,000
can absolutely take a look at yeah and i think on the design side when we're looking at unique designs

1111
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:52,000
i think uh there are still some spots in the game like with poison trap this season where there were

1112
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
some skills or some play styles that had um you know had some threads there but it wasn't really a

1113
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
complete and cohesive build and still require a bit more support so we're still going to be looking

1114
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,000
for those opportunities to to support um builds or play styles that we think are interesting and fun

1115
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,000
with new uniques every season um but additionally we are also taking a look at at kind of that the

1116
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
you know the catalog of uniques we have in the game so a good example on rogue again is that the

1117
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,000
scoundrel's leather this season uh that was an item that was uh sometimes played but not often for

1118
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
its actual unique effect for some of its affixes actually it was pretty powerful um but its unique effect was was

1119
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
pretty lackluster and so we've done a just a whole rework on it we said hey what's the identity of

1120
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
this well it's it's talking to to death trap builds in a way but in a way that wasn't super compelling

1121
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:41,000
and so we said well let's let's kind of scrap that existing effect and and how can we better support

1122
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
that let's take another try at this um so that's one way that we're going to look at uh to to find those

1123
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
underused uniques that really maybe don't find a home uh we're going to constantly be reevaluating them

1124
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,000
and seeing how we can kind of plus them up and and make them achieve the potential and fulfill that that

1125
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,000
build a niche that that they were intended to do in the first place all right i mean i ended with the

1126
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:07,000
last question because if everyone's asking this related to aspirational content is there going to

1127
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:14,000
be are there more plans for that things like whether it's a potential leaderboards to more like end game

1128
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:21,000
type of features and stuff do we where are we in regards to some of that yeah i'll say the team

1129
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
absolutely this is top of mind and something that we absolutely want to improve in terms of adding

1130
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,000
more milestones for you to reach uh more satisfying and more rewarding milestones and celebrating those

1131
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:37,000
milestones so the team is actively sort of looking at what are ways that we can level up some of the

1132
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:42,000
aspirational feel of the game i'll also say just in season eight again a lot of the torment tiers and

1133
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:48,000
bosses have really been leveled up and i'll say again the pit has been pretty massively buffed so

1134
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
there are uh some tuning changes we've made just to make the game the pieces that we have today

1135
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:57,000
a little bit more aspirational and challenging and satisfying to overcome we really think season

1136
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:03,000
seven was a fun candy rush and it was a it was a sugar rush uh sort of like the smoothie smoothies

1137
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:08,000
everyone's uh been shrinking behind not everyone uh not everyone yeah only the important

1138
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
people behind the screen that it got delivered midstream

1139
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:19,000
yeah marcus redeemed yeah but uh like uh season seven was really fast and we do think when the

1140
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
game reaches that state if we're just nothing really you have to work for it and it's just really fast

1141
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
and it's over in a weekend totally there's not enough things to work towards so we are sort of taking

1142
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:33,000
an approach again with some of the balance changes to make some of the game feel a little bit more

1143
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:39,000
aspirational and it's a focus for our team going forward yeah and i i will say we've had conversations

1144
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:45,000
about this i feel like almost weekly colin and i talk about it a whole lot i know uh there's a

1145
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:50,000
