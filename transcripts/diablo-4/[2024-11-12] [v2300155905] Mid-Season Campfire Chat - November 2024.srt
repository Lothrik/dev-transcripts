1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I have to say it just went way beyond my expectation.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's like nothing that we had in D4.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Pure hatred, their Mephisto's army.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We wanted them to feel a little bit more different from your typical demon family.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Everyone's quality was top notch.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But at the time, we didn't know if it was going to work.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I think what we landed is going to turn some heads.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is not your normal thing. It's the living form of hatred.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The new monster class that we get to introduce, they're called hollows.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
These hollows have actually been around for like millennia.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Mephisto at some point did go to Nahantu a long, long, long time ago.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And these hollows were a reaction of Mephisto being in Nahantu at the time.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And then they went dormant.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Bringing Mephisto in the Soul Stone seems like the right thing to do for Narell.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But it has a chain reaction that I don't think anybody was prepared for.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The hollows are really rife throughout Nahantu now that Mephisto is back.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And just visually, like horribly disgusting.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And sort of made up of the things that have been consumed by the hollows.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, they're an extension of evil.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Infecting wildlife and other monsters and people with this thing called ichor.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And they're just sort of going mad.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
When we're designing the hollows, the main thing that we wanted to push was just if hatred came to life, what would it look like?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So we're thinking this black goo that's kind of like formless but also have this red anger energy inside of it.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then with concept, we just want to make, you know, cool monsters.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What if it's three legs? What if it's no legs? What if it has like three arms?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So we pushed a lot of like options and exploration.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And then from then on, like everyone from narrative to design and concept would talk about it.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's like, okay, we like this one and then we can push it and move it further.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The hollow family is made up of four members.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The swarmer, the spitter, the caster, and the brutes.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
A big thing for me was that the family need to be overwhelming without just relying on pure numbers.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So they're going to get stronger over time if you let them fester their hatred after all.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The swarmer can teleport and attack you from behind, from the sides.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The spitter is a slug with legs.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They spew out this vomit stream of who the brute is.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The big hulking slow guy of the family.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He has the shield that's buffing and making the rest of the army stronger.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The caster is responsible for creating new swarmers.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They also will channel onto a specific hollow and view them with an extra feature.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It makes them stronger and more deadly.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The hollow caster's role serve as an elegant, hovering, yet menacing dungeon character in the game.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Really inform many of our design ideas.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
When we want to make a new variant, we want to know in which specific area we are going to see that character or creature.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Readability is like the main focus.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We went through several iterations on the design, the texture, the materials, and the camera testing.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The day after she gave me like, what was it, 10 different variations?

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Different variations?

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now we are talking.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The emission on the spikes really like, did an awesome job to both on the CineVet and also to improve the readability.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And in the end, we have the version that we were both happy with.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And yeah, hand it over to the tech artist.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We had some really strong narrative direction in understanding how big of a role hatred played.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And we knew that we needed one look to tie it all together.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This hatred has one source and it's all about Mephisto.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
For the hollows specifically, we identified that we wanted to do some special work with the materials, with the shaders for those characters.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Shaders are the code that runs on the GPU that takes in all sorts of inputs like textures and lighting and position and outputs what the object's surface is supposed to look like.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We wanted a shader that was capable of adding this sludge layer, this hatred layer over top of it, and making it dynamic and animating so that it really looks like it was constantly undulating or writhing.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So once we had this shader function, we were able to apply that in all these different contexts, like the monsters, like the environment, the character armors even.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Most of the shader work was done by Alex, who really took that shader function and made it work in all sorts of different contexts.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And we also have the hatred add-ons to these characters, these tentacles, these writhing hatred growths all over them, which was a procedurally generated process that was largely run by Sky on our team.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The Hollows boss was kind of born of this idea of what does a pinnacle hollows really look like.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We have the Hollows family, and that was pretty well defined by the time that the Hollows boss kind of came up for concepting.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Our artist, Victor, had a lot of cool ideas for horror themes and really wanted to push visuals with contortions and breaking the neck of this monster all over the place.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's where we had the option to go, like, and we'd push it and really get that idea of what Hatred and the Hollows are all about.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This inky black ichor that latched on to a once powerful spellcaster.

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It was such a great source of power that this particular Hollows monster turned into the priestess of Hatred.

68
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm Victor Lee, a principal concept artist on the Diablo team.

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and I concepted the Priestess of Hatred.

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Victor Lee is one of the OGs from Diablo and he's known for creating a lot of dark imagery.

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And every time we want to have a monster or boss, he's done all the greats, even Diablo himself.

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
One of his monitors on the side of his desk is just like a dark black eye staring at him.

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And so when we needed something that's pure darkness, like, we had to tap Vic.

74
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I feel like when we're talking about Hatred, I kind of imagine, visualize it as like a black webby-like thing.

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So I thought a spider configuration would work for this.

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So I did a few variations, some with souls, human souls trapped in the abdomen.

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's like a purgatory because this creature consumes humans.

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I have this nagging feeling for a long time that why I felt it's not working.

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's not working.

80
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No matter how interesting the design is, I'm not pushing the boundaries.

81
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So I basically rethought the whole thing.

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
A lot of our creatures are just like raw aggression.

83
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's just muscly and just brutal.

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Maybe this one is more insidious.

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What if the human figure is not controlling the hatred, but it's the other way around?

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Like the hatred is actually mocking humanity.

87
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's like dragging a puppet around.

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So what I did is I kept the human figure as a focal point, but the rest of the creature is this moving mass of basically a ball of hatred.

89
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It broke a lot of rules, but I felt, I just felt like this just fits.

90
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So I went ahead with it and rendered it out.

91
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I was looking at the concept for the first time with the designer on the feature, Charles,

92
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and we were kind of in this stunned silence for a little bit because it was this reaction of,

93
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
this thing is so cool.

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And then we started thinking, how are we even going to make this thing move?

95
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Typically our monsters are bipedal or they're quadrupeds.

96
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How's it going to move?

97
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We can't rely on walk cycles anymore.

98
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How's it going to rotate?

99
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We can't rely on, you know, the built in rotation stuff without looking weird as hell.

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It was clear that in order to make this like animate and look natural,

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
we were going to have to pretty much dive into uncharted territory.

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We wanted it to move in a very unique way.

103
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We wanted it to somersault through the air and be super unpredictable and zippy

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and just have like ridiculous animations as those tentacles are flying all over the place.

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We had that narrative and kind of drive to make it formless and with our conventional rigging that we can do that.

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We were doing prototyping before the feature even kicked off.

107
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Like we were already meeting with animation and tech art to say,

108
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hey, we have this thing. We think it's really cool, but we need help figuring this out.

109
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So we had a lot of early collaboration, which was really what set us up for success.

110
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When the animator came back with it, going from post to post rather than your normal animations,

111
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I was like, yes, that's it. That's what hatred should feel like.

112
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
When you first find the priestess of hatred, it's going to look like a lifeless human corpse.

113
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And you're like, this is doesn't look like a boss fight. I'm in a boss arena. What's going on?

114
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But as you approach, you see that the body gets pulled into a giant pool of hatred.

115
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And then out of that pool of hatred comes this giant mass of tentacles. And that is the boss.

116
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So after animation, it gets to come to me and I get to do all of the really cool visual effects at the end.

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Show what those tentacles are doing when they impact them out, when they slap something, when they hit the player.

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It really brings the entire thing together.

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The vomit attack is really gross because there's like this part of the torso of the humanoid that has been kind of hollowed out and now has teeth.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The tentacles come out from the mass and they grab the humanoid and kind of pull the body back so that the slit in the belly opens up and all of the hatred just pours out a straight beam.

121
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's pretty gross.

122
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The hollows are just such a unique family. From the moment they spawn in on your screen, you can tell that they are different.

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They have just such unique behaviors and animations.

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We were able to execute on a vision that's really just so different than what we typically do.

125
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The whole process made me feel very proud of our whole team.

126
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Everyone just got it. They understood what the monster was. They got the vision and it just worked.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The eye on the screen has many functions. It keeps me in the right frame of mind.

128
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What we are doing is dark. It should be horrifying. I should feel the fear while I'm doing it.

129
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's a reminder of that. The eye also serves as a warning.

130
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Like, get moving. Don't dwell too long and wander around. You know? Get this thing moving. Get the work done.

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hello!

132
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
to grab something really quickly.

133
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Welcome to another Diablo 4 Campfire Chat.

134
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
My name is Adam Fletcher.

135
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Of course, I'm joined by two familiar faces

136
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
on our Campfire Chats.

137
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We have Mr. Adam Jackson and Mr. Colin Feiner.

138
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Hello, everyone.

139
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's been a little while since we've seen everyone.

140
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We obviously have lots of...

141
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
has changed since our last stream.

142
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We ended up launching Vessel of Hatred,

143
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
which is really awesome to see.

144
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Tons of players online,

145
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
checking out all the new features within Diablo 4,

146
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and of course, the Spiritborn as well.

147
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We've been hearing a lot about this here, Warren.

148
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Seems a little obvious.

149
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And, yeah, awesome.

150
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's too weak, right?

151
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's too weak.

152
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, that's what we've heard.

153
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's apparently what we most definitely heard.

154
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But, no, it is a little strong,

155
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and we've heard that from a lot of people.

156
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We'll be talking about that a little bit today.

157
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But first, before we do jump in,

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I do want to talk about some plans,

159
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
upcoming plans that we have for streams.

160
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Obviously, we're doing this stream right now

161
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
for the midseason update.

162
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The midseason update is actually currently scheduled

163
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
to release next week.

164
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We won't have patch notes immediately after this stream.

165
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
As you know, we're doing this stream on a Tuesday,

166
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
which is a little bit of a different day for us.

167
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
We typically end up doing these streams later in the week

168
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
when we do release those patch notes.

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But you will have patch notes later this week.

170
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We just need to get them through localization,

171
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
make sure everyone sees them,

172
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and we get all the final changes in them

173
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
before we actually do release them.

174
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But you will have the final patch notes

175
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
for midseason update later this week.

176
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And then, again, midseason update next week.

177
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We will be back next week for another stream.

178
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah.

179
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So back-to-back weeks for streams.

180
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Lots of streams coming up.

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So this one is going to be a pretty quick one

182
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to go over midseason update.

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And then next week,

184
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
we're actually going to talk about the Season 7 PTR.

185
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I should actually call it Patch 2.1 PTR

186
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
is specifically the name of it.

187
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
We're going to be talking about all the changes

188
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
that are coming with Patch 2.1.

189
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That stream is also going to be a little earlier

190
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
than when PTR is planning on actually starting.

191
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's only because for those here in the U.S.

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
that are aware of it,

193
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the Thanksgiving holiday is coming up

194
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
towards the end of November,

195
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and we won't have people in the office.

196
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So we want to make sure

197
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that we can do the stream a little early

198
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
and talk to everyone about the Patch 2.1 PTR

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
before the end of the month.

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
PTR itself is planning on starting

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
after the holidays,

202
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
or after that Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S.,

203
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and then for the notes regarding PTR,

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
we'll have that before the holidays.

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So everyone can get to,

206
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
at least in the U.S.,

207
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
they can eat turkey, read patch notes,

208
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and then elsewhere,

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
they can just read patch notes.

210
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And so we have a lot of stuff coming up

211
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and a lot to talk about,

212
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
but before we do get towards

213
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
some of the other items,

214
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I know, Colin,

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you want to talk a little bit

216
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
about where we're at with D4 at the moment?

217
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah, absolutely.

218
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So I'll try and keep it short and sweet.

219
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
For the midseason,

220
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
we actually think,

221
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I just wanted to talk a little bit

222
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
about how we think about the game currently.

223
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You know, we've changed a lot over the past year.

224
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We've changed itemization.

225
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We've changed all of the progression.

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And generally, I think,

227
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
you know, we've seen a ton of positive feedback

228
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
around a lot of the progression changes

229
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
made in X1, which is fantastic.

230
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We're really excited to make a lot of these changes.

231
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I think it's hit a lot of the goals

232
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
in terms of opening up what builds

233
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
you can actually play

234
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and experience a lot of the endgame,

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,000
which is great.

236
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Of course, there's, you know,

237
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Spiritborn, Kicking Ass,

238
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and Pit Tier 150.

239
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But like, otherwise,

240
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
there's a lot of builds

241
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
that sort of can cut it in the endgame,

242
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
starting in Torment 1.

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And I think that's been super,

244
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
like, sort of successful for us.

245
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And I also think, like,

246
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
a lot of the sort of itemization changes

247
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
we've made in terms of ancestral items,

248
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
we think that, like,

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
they're a little bit on the low side.

250
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We'll talk a little bit more

251
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
next week in the PTR

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
in terms of buffing those.

253
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But we think, like,

254
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
it's actually pretty cool

255
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
that there's those chase items

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
that people are looking for.

257
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I think just generally,

258
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,000
we're pretty happy

259
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
with how a lot of things landed.

260
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And right now,

261
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
we're sort of taking a step back

262
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and seeing, okay,

263
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
now that we've made a lot of these changes,

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
what are the more iterative steps

265
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we're going to take in the next year

266
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
in terms of, like,

267
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
tightening up a lot of things.

268
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You know, full disclosure,

269
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I think we missed the mark

270
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
a little bit on material tuning

271
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and things like that.

272
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Had to do a couple updates

273
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
on material tuning.

274
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Just a couple.

275
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, just a couple.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So we're really looking

277
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
at tightening up a lot of those things

278
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and sort of making more iterative changes

279
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
to the overall progression of the game.

280
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And we hope that that creates

281
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
some more stability

282
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and that sort of lets us, you know,

283
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
sort of put more time

284
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and focus on, like, balance

285
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and adding more things

286
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and sort of leveling up the game

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
in that sort of way.

288
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah, just thinking back a year ago,

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
like, so much has changed

290
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
in our systems, right?

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Like, we did all of our combat math

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,000
over again.

293
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We changed resistances.

294
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We changed how loot drops

295
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and, you know,

296
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
the whole upgrade system there

297
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
in Season 4.

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Unique's got a big overhaul.

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Like, there's been so much change

300
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,000
in things.

301
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm looking forward to having a chance

302
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
for things to kind of settle down

303
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and we can fine-tune and refine

304
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
the existing systems that we have

305
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
now that we have so many ways

306
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
of progressing your character,

307
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
making yourself stronger.

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And I think there's a lot of room

309
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
for improvement inside of these systems

310
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
to make them kind of better,

311
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,000
which I know people

312
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
have been requesting a lot.

313
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So we're looking forward to that.

314
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's really about refining

316
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
what we currently have.

317
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
We feel like the structure

318
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
is really strong right now.

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, most definitely.

320
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And I know with this mid-season update,

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
we, of course, the biggest topic

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
that we've been hearing a lot

323
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is around class balance,

324
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
specifically around, like,

325
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Spirit Born right now

326
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and how it is performing very well

327
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
compared to some of the other classes.

328
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And so, Mr. Adam Jackson,

329
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I know you wanted to talk a little bit

330
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
about some of the class balance.

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, let's talk about classes.

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
We've got a lot to go over today.

333
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So, first, just to give an overview

334
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
of kind of what I'm going to talk about.

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
First, we're going to talk a little bit

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
about kind of the state of Season 6

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and kind of how we see things

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and how things are going.

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And then we're going to give you

340
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
a preview of some of the changes

341
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
that we're going to be doing

342
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,000
for all the classes.

343
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Normal disclaimer here,

344
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
you know, we're not going to be covering

345
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
everything that we're going to do

346
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
here in the past.

347
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There could be a lot more notes

348
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
than what I'm showing today.

349
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But just to kind of give you an idea

350
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
of what's coming for each class

351
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and kind of what you can look forward to.

352
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So, yeah, the current state of Season 6.

353
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So, you know, a whole lot of people

354
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
are enjoying the Spirit Born.

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I think this class has been

356
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
really successful.

357
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You know, we've been hearing

358
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
that it's a lot of fun.

359
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
People are really liking

360
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
kind of the way that you build,

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
the way that you play,

362
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and just the class in general,

363
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
which is really gratifying for the team.

364
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Just for some stats here,

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
62% of all players

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
have played the Spirit Born.

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So, you know, when you think

368
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
the other six classes in the game now

369
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and 62% of people are playing it,

370
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
you know, that's kind of a lot of love

371
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
for the class,

372
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
which is pretty exciting to see.

373
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And to give you a basis

374
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
of comparison here,

375
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the Sorceress in Season 5

376
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
was the most played class,

377
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and she was at 32%.

378
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So, you know, I gave you an idea,

379
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
and that was, you know,

380
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Lightning Spear meta,

381
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and, you know, this class

382
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
was really, really good.

383
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
A lot of people had fun.

384
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And so you can kind of compare there

385
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
just how many people

386
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
kind of logged into the expansion

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and enjoyed that.

388
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So that's pretty exciting.

389
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yeah, just a few, right?

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, so kind of the state of the game.

391
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You know, the Spirit Born

392
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
is performing quite a bit better

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,000
than other classes,

394
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
which we want to dig deep,

395
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
you know, do a little bit

396
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
of a deep dive into how and why

397
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and how we think about it.

398
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Largely, a big culprit of this

399
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
is actually due to unintended interactions

400
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
that the class has

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
with how some things scale

402
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and other issues.

403
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But then there's also

404
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
another component

405
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
that there are some balance issues

406
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
with the class itself.

407
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And so it's pretty easy

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
to conflate these two

409
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and be like, well,

410
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
how much of the power

411
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
is due to, like, you know,

412
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
bugs or unintended interactions

413
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
and how much of it is just

414
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
some things have high numbers.

415
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We do think it's a bit of both,

416
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
but the unintended interactions,

417
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I think, are the lion's share

418
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
of what's going on here.

419
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But on the bright side,

420
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,000
the other classes

421
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
are actually performing

422
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
fairly well

423
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
when compared to one another.

424
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So if you look at, you know,

425
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Barbarian compared to Necromancer

426
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
or Druid compared to Sorceress,

427
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
they're actually pretty close

428
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and competitive

429
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
when we see, like,

430
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Pit Tier clears

431
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and other content,

432
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,000
how they're doing,

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
which is a really good sign for us.

434
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So when we're thinking of kind of

435
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
what we're going to do going forward

436
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and how we balance the game,

437
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
there's kind of two really statements

438
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
that we need to think about

439
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
when it comes to balance.

440
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The first one that's really important

441
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
is we want players

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
to feel strong and powerful

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and to kind of feel like

444
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
they can break the game

445
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and find these crazy builds

446
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and do awesome things with.

447
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And then on the other side of the coin,

448
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
we also want kind of, you know,

449
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
class balance and parity

450
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
when it comes to a power level

451
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
with one another, right?

452
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You know, we don't want a situation

453
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
that exists for a really long time

454
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
where, you know,

455
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
the only answer is to play Barbarian,

456
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
for example,

457
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
compared to everything else

458
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and that's all that you kind of

459
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
be pushed into playing.

460
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So these two things

461
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,000
are kind of at odds

462
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
with one another

463
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and we've kind of gone back and forth

464
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
on our strategies here.

465
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If you remember back

466
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
when we launched Diablo 4,

467
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
we really actually prioritized

468
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
class parity and harmony

469
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
over, you know,

470
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
everything else,

471
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
over the power fantasy of the game.

472
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And what this resulted in

473
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
was every time that someone

474
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
found a build

475
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that was really strong and crazy.

476
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
We just kind of

477
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
would fix the bugs

478
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
or nerf the build

479
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and we ended up

480
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
kind of playing whack-a-mole

481
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
every time that players

482
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
found something cool.

483
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And it ended up being

484
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
that Blizzard kind of

485
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
turned into the fun police,

486
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
which players really didn't like.

487
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We got a pretty big reaction

488
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
at the end of the launch period

489
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and into season one

490
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
when we tried to only think

491
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
about class parity

492
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
over kind of

493
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
the power fantasy of Diablo.

494
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And in season two,

495
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
we kind of really

496
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
turned things around

497
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
in the way that we thought

498
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,000
about the game

499
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and we really prioritized

500
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
power fantasy

501
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and this idea

502
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that our players

503
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
kind of want to break the game

504
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and be crazy.

505
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The big shining example there

506
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
was Ball Lightning

507
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
for you Sorcerous Mains

508
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
where that skill

509
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
had an unintended interaction.

510
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It was really, really good,

511
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
but players really liked it

512
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and had a lot of fun.

513
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And so if you remember

514
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
a long time ago,

515
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
we came on live stream

516
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and we talked about this

517
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and we kind of said

518
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
that we were going to

519
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
allow players

520
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
to kind of break the game

521
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,000
in this way

522
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
until the next season, right?

523
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There are some exceptions

524
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,000
that we'll make

525
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
where we'll fix things

526
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,000
in the mid-season

527
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
if it's impacting

528
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the performance of the game

529
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,000
or the experience

530
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
of other players,

531
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
like if your build

532
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
is causing a bunch of lag

533
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
or something,

534
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
then we'll fix it right away.

535
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I think in season six

536
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
we had this example

537
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
with the Evade build

538
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,000
with Spirit Board.

539
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But overall,

540
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
players really liked

541
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,000
this strategy

542
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
a whole lot more, right?

543
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
They got to enjoy

544
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,000
this kind of,

545
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
the point of playing

546
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
ARPGs and Diablo

547
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
in particular,

548
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
of really making

549
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,000
a powerful character

550
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and being able

551
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
to smash faces with it, right?

552
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah, and the sort

553
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
of philosophy here

554
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
is sort of

555
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
goes even beyond classes, right?

556
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000
If you remember

557
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
in season one,

558
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
we were just nerfing

559
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
every dungeon

560
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
that was to perform in

561
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and like any time

562
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
like there was content

563
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
that was like a little bit

564
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
out of budget,

565
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
we'd nerf it.

566
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So it's really about

567
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
sort of establishing

568
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
a trust with you,

569
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the player,

570
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
during that season

571
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and not trying to

572
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
sort of force you

573
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
to exploit the fun

574
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
early and often.

575
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And it's really about

576
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
sort of making sure

577
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
that when you play a season,

578
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,000
you know that that season

579
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
is going to work

580
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
the same throughout the season

581
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and we're not going

582
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,000
to change things

583
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
midway on you.

584
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, I think another factor

585
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,000
to think about too

586
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
is that now that we've added

587
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
a lot of progression

588
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
like tempering

589
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and master working,

590
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,000
that there's a lot

591
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
of time investment

592
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
that goes into

593
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
making a build

594
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
even if you know

595
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
something that might

596
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,000
be unintended,

597
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,000
but it's really,

598
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
really good and crazy

599
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and you spend,

600
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,000
you know,

601
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
40 plus,

602
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
100 hours,

603
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,000
whatever,

604
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
making it.

605
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And if we kind of

606
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,000
pull the rug out

607
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
from under you,

608
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
it's worrisome

609
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
to do that to players,

610
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I think,

611
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
in the middle of a season.

612
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's all about

613
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
respecting your time,

614
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,000
right?

615
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah.

616
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So in that vein,

617
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
we are not planning

618
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
to nerf the Spiritborn

619
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
in the midseason patch,

620
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
which I think is the thing

621
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
that's on everybody's mind.

622
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Like, is Blizzard

623
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
going to do it?

624
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And we've decided that

625
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
we think it's best

626
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,000
for the game

627
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
to not do it

628
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
in the midseason.

629
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So in Season 7,

630
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and we'll be talking

631
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
about this a little more

632
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
in the live stream

633
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
next week,

634
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,000
we are going to be

635
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
fixing all the

636
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
unintended interactions

637
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
that we found

638
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,000
with Spiritborn.

639
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
We'll also be making

640
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
balance adjustments

641
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
to bring them in line

642
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
with the other classes.

643
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So you can expect

644
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
a lot of change there.

645
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But until then,

646
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
enjoy what you've got now

647
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
while it's there.

648
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I think it's worth

649
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
digging into

650
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
the unintended interactions

651
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
part too, right?

652
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Because it's not necessarily

653
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
like you picked

654
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
one legendary Paragon node

655
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and now your build

656
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
is ridiculous, right?

657
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's like you're sort of,

658
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
for lack of a better word,

659
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
abusing some of the mechanics,

660
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,000
right?

661
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
If we know Viscous Shield

662
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
is scaling off of max HP,

663
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,000
players have poured tons

664
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
of time and effort

665
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
trying to max Masterwork,

666
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
their max life

667
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and getting all the

668
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
perfect tempers

669
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
and item affixes,

670
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,000
we don't want to take

671
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
that away from you, right?

672
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That's not something

673
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
that we're trying to

674
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
necessarily destroy

675
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
all the time commitment

676
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
you put into your character

677
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
by fixing these things.

678
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So it's not as simple

679
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
as just fixed

680
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
unintended interaction, right?

681
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But just reiterating,

682
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
it is that those

683
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
unintended interactions

684
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
are things that we will

685
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
look at when we get

686
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
to Season 7

687
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and we start off

688
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
with Season 7.

689
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So obviously with

690
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,000
mid-season update,

691
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,000
enjoy it.

692
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Enjoy it through Season 6,

693
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
but come Season 7

694
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and you'll see a preview

695
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
of some of these changes

696
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
with Season 7

697
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
in our PTR stream next week.

698
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You'll see some of the

699
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
changes that we plan on.

700
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah, there's a lot

701
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,000
coming there,

702
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
but this isn't about that.

703
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,000
This isn't about that

704
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
in mid-season.

705
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
There's a lot coming there

706
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,000
for everybody

707
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
that'll be really exciting.

708
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But yeah,

709
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
but the caveat

710
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
to all of this is

711
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
if something does come up

712
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
that impacts other players

713
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
in regards to the game's performance

714
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
or you're causing lag

715
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
for the server or whatever,

716
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
we will be fixing

717
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
those types of interactions

718
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
as soon as possible.

719
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Like the evade build

720
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
is our example, right?

721
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We will fix those right away

722
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
because we want to make sure

723
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
that the game is, you know,

724
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
performant for everybody.

725
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So in the mid-season though,

726
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
we are going to be buffing

727
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
all the other classes

728
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
in the mid-season patch,

729
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
but I want to caveat

730
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
this a little bit with

731
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
it's not going to be

732
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
to the level of Spiritborn

733
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
right now

734
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
because a lot of that power

735
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
is due to bugs

736
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and unintended things.

737
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So we're really going to be

738
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
buffing the classes

739
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
to have more parity

740
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and harmony with each other,

741
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
but then also to kind of

742
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
where we plan to bring

743
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
the Spiritborn to

744
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
after, you know,

745
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
the bugs and stuff

746
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
has been fixed.

747
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So you will be seeing

748
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
number buffs,

749
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,000
but, you know,

750
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I wouldn't expect to be

751
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,000
at the same level

752
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
as what Spiritborn is doing

753
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
right now in the mid-season,

754
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
just to be clear,

755
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,000
because of that,

756
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,000
the bugs are actually

757
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
a big part of the power level.

758
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah, and we don't want

759
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
to create an arms race, right?

760
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Where it's like,

761
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
okay, everyone gets to be

762
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Pit Tier 150,

763
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
then the next natural ask

764
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
is like, okay,

765
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I guess we're adding

766
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
to them in 5, 6, 7, 8, right?

767
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So we don't want to sort of

768
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
get to a place where,

769
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,000
you know,

770
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
you're cheering through

771
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
12 different Torment Tiers,

772
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
sort of really being cautious

773
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
about the arms race here.

774
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,000
We actually think

775
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
the rest of the classes

776
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
are in a really good spot.

777
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, and I think you can

778
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
count on that going forward,

779
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
too, not even just right now,

780
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,000
but this is kind of the way

781
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
that we think of things

782
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,000
in general.

783
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's like,

784
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
if all the classes

785
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
are kind of in this realm

786
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
kind of close to each other

787
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and then one has

788
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
something unintended

789
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
that brings, like,

790
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,000
way up here,

791
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
everybody is always like,

792
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,000
well, let's just bring

793
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
everybody else to this.

794
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah.

795
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But if we do that every time,

796
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
like, you start with this difference

797
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and then you're here

798
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and then you do this

799
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,000
level the game

800
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
just insanely high

801
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
really fast, right?

802
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And that's not our goal, right?

803
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So if there's something

804
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
that stands out,

805
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,000
we'll let people do it

806
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
for a while,

807
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,000
but then we're going to

808
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
bring it back the next season.

809
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yeah.

810
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And that's kind of the way

811
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,000
that I think you can

812
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
mostly count on us

813
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
doing balance

814
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and how the choices

815
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that we make and why.

816
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Definitely.

817
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And the same goes

818
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
if there's, like,

819
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
an underperforming class.

820
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's, like, 20 pit tiers

821
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
behind everyone else, right?

822
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
We have no problems

823
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
with, like, bringing that up

824
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
to where the rest

825
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
of the classes are.

826
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Correct.

827
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah, the real goal

828
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
is to get everything

829
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
in a pretty good realm

830
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
of having harmony

831
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,000
with one another

832
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
when something's

833
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,000
out of balance,

834
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
it's okay for a season,

835
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
but then we're going to

836
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
try to bring it back, right?

837
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That's kind of always our goal.

838
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So, yeah, let's get into

839
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
the class updates

840
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,000
for all the classes.

841
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,000
We're just going to be

842
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
going through one by one

843
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and kind of giving you

844
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
a preview of what to see.

845
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Again, this is only a preview.

846
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
There's more than

847
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,000
what we're going to show

848
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
on screen.

849
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, way more, right?

850
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
This is just, like,

851
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
a couple examples

852
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
within the stream itself.

853
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And, again, just a reminder,

854
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
patch notes later this week,

855
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
once we get everything

856
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
kind of sorted,

857
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
we're at normal time

858
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
for a stream

859
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,000
on a Tuesday,

860
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
normally we do it

861
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
on Thursday

862
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and usually have

863
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
patch notes then.

864
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So I expect the patch notes

865
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,000
later this week.

866
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah, let's get to it.

867
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So starting off

868
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000
with Barbarian,

869
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
we got some baseline

870
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
core skill buffs

871
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,000
for pretty much

872
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
all of them, right?

873
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You can see here,

874
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Upheaval,

875
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Hammer of the Ancients,

876
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Double Swing,

877
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and Rend.

878
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Basically, you know,

879
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
we always hear it that

880
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
they have a little bit

881
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
of trouble leveling.

882
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Their late game

883
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
is really good,

884
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
but just getting there

885
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
can be a little bit painful.

886
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So we're just going to be

887
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
squeezing up those numbers

888
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
a little bit more.

889
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So you'll have a better

890
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,000
time leveling.

891
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You'll also be a little

892
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
bit stronger overall,

893
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
but all the builds

894
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
will get a little bit better.

895
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And then also we have

896
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
some buffs to

897
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,000
underperforming

898
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
legendaries and uniques.

899
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Here's an example

900
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
with an aspect,

901
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Battle Mad.

902
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You can see here

903
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
in the before,

904
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
kind of what's on live

905
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
right now is it's

906
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
basically just a way

907
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
to give you Berserking,

908
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
rewarding you for

909
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,000
weapon swapping.

910
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And now we're adding

911
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
a hefty multiplier to it.

912
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So now this is going to be

913
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
a real offensive aspect

914
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
that's going to give you,

915
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,000
you know,

916
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
a bunch of power.

917
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You're going to get

918
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
up to a 40% damage buff

919
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
when you're doing

920
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
the weapon swapping mechanics.

921
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So we're kind of

922
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
finding these places

923
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
where we can input damage

924
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,000
or, you know,

925
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
these underused

926
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
legendaries or uniques

927
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and then adding a reason

928
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
to make them more compelling.

929
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Next we've got Druid.

930
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So all of the Druid's

931
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
key passives are getting buffed.

932
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I've given a couple

933
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
of examples here,

934
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
but I'm pretty sure

935
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,000
all of them,

936
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
the numbers went up.

937
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So Lupine Ferocity,

938
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
you've got the crit damage

939
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
going from 70 to 100% bonus.

940
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And then the bonus damage

941
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
to injured enemies

942
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
going from 140

943
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,000
to 200%,

944
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
which is pretty meaty.

945
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And then the one

946
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
with nature passive

947
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
that buffs your companions,

948
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
that bonus damage

949
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
is going from 60 to 80%,

950
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
which is a pretty big amount.

951
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
And then also legendary

952
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,000
you need buffs

953
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
in the same way

954
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
of the Barbarian.

955
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So here this is

956
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
an offensive aspect,

957
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
even though I'd argue

958
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
it's kind of more utility,

959
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
but the Storm Chaser's aspect

960
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,000
where it makes

961
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
your tornadoes smart,

962
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
where they seek enemies.

963
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
We're just adding

964
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
a pretty good multiplier

965
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000
to that.

966
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So Tornado Builds Rejoice,

967
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,000
you're going to get

968
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
up to 50% more damage now

969
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
just from taking this aspect

970
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
that you were probably

971
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
taking anyways.

972
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So just making you happier

973
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
to take the same things.

974
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Next one,

975
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
the Basilisk.

976
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
This is the Earth Druid

977
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
dealing with Petrify.

978
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So before,

979
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
it was that first time

980
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
that you hit an enemy,

981
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
you'll Petrify them,

982
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and then every time

983
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
you Petrify them,

984
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
it deals a bunch of damage.

985
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
We're just making that

986
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
a lot more usable,

987
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
so that way you can feel

988
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
more comfortable taking it.

989
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So now it's going to be

990
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
when you hit a healthy enemy,

991
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
you'll Petrify them.

992
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And also,

993
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
this will work against bosses.

994
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So every five seconds

995
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
that you hit a boss,

996
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
you'll attempt to Petrify,

997
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and then you'll get

998
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
that bonus damage proc.

999
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So basically,

1000
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
this unique now

1001
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
will be giving you

1002
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
a damage proc

1003
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,000
every five seconds

1004
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
against bosses,

1005
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
which will be a lot better

1006
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,000
than now,

1007
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
where it doesn't really do

1008
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
much to bosses at all.

1009
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Next, we've got

1010
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the Necromancer.

1011
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So they're getting buffs

1012
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
for all their basic skills.

1013
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm showing Decompose

1014
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
here as an example.

1015
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The damage is almost

1016
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
being doubled.

1017
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Your Essence gain

1018
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
per second is going up

1019
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,000
by quite a bit.

1020
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And also now,

1021
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
it'll scale with

1022
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Attack Speed bonuses.

1023
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So now,

1024
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,000
if you build Attack Speed

1025
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
or you have it,

1026
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Decompose is going to be

1027
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
generating Essence

1028
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
for you quicker,

1029
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
which it didn't used to before.

1030
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,000
They're also getting

1031
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
some buffs

1032
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and kind of some

1033
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
simple functionality changes

1034
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
to some passives.

1035
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So an example here

1036
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
with the Evulsion passive

1037
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
is before,

1038
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
you would get

1039
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
increased Crit damage

1040
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
to vulnerable enemies.

1041
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And now we're just going

1042
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
to remove that

1043
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
double requirement there

1044
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
of focusing on Crit and Vuln.

1045
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So now you'll just get

1046
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,000
more damage

1047
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
against vulnerable enemies.

1048
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So it's just a lot

1049
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
more usable.

1050
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's now used,

1051
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,000
you can use it

1052
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
more generally.

1053
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You don't have to worry

1054
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,000
about critting all the time

1055
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
to get the bonus.

1056
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
So it'll just be

1057
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
more consistent.

1058
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And then we've got

1059
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
some unique buffs here.

1060
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
These are just number buffs.

1061
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Some examples,

1062
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
we've got Mordecrux,

1063
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
so the chance to spawn

1064
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
the Skeletal Simulacrum

1065
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
is going up.

1066
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And Howl from below,

1067
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,000
you're just getting,

1068
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000
you know,

1069
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
more Corpse Explosion

1070
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,000
damage out of it.

1071
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So just tuning up

1072
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
these numbers

1073
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,000
to make them competitive.

1074
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Next,

1075
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,000
we've got the Rogue.

1076
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So similar to

1077
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the Barbarian,

1078
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
the Rogue is also

1079
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,000
getting buffs to the

1080
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Core skills.

1081
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Penetrate Shot damage

1082
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,000
is going up.

1083
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Flurry damage is going up

1084
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
as some examples.

1085
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Also,

1086
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
their Key Passives

1087
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
are getting a bit better too.

1088
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Victimize,

1089
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
the Damage Scaling

1090
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
is going up

1091
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
for your Vulnerable

1092
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Damage bonus.

1093
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And Precision

1094
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,000
is going up

1095
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
by a pretty hefty amount

1096
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
from 15% to 20%

1097
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
of your Crit Damage bonus.

1098
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So it'll just be

1099
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,000
a lot more potent.

1100
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And next,

1101
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
we've got the Sorceress

1102
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
kind of keeping on

1103
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,000
the theme of

1104
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
buffing Key Passives.

1105
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So this one,

1106
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,000
we're actually doing

1107
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
a bit of a functionality change.

1108
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So Combustion before

1109
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
used to be that,

1110
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,000
you know,

1111
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
you get a big multiplier

1112
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
to your Burning Damage,

1113
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
60%.

1114
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And then after that,

1115
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
we kind of wanted

1116
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,000
to reward you

1117
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
for putting different

1118
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Burning Sources

1119
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,000
on enemies

1120
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and you would get

1121
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
a little bit of a bonus

1122
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
per source.

1123
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Now we're doing away

1124
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
with that second part.

1125
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So you're still getting

1126
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the Burning Damage buff

1127
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
just across the board.

1128
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But now we're actually

1129
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,000
going to tie it

1130
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
to itemization.

1131
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So now you'll just

1132
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
be getting an additional

1133
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
multiplier based on

1134
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
your Damage to Burning

1135
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Enemies bonus.

1136
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So now you're going

1137
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
to be looking for that,

1138
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,000
you know,

1139
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in your gear,

1140
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in your Paragon

1141
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and other places.

1142
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So you can now just

1143
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,000
really buff up

1144
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
the Burning Damage

1145
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and you don't have

1146
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
to worry about putting

1147
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,000
a bunch of sources

1148
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
on enemies.

1149
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Next,

1150
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
a similar vein,

1151
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Avalanche.

1152
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,000
This key passive

1153
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
is just getting better

1154
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and is going to be

1155
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
tuning into a Damage

1156
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
bonus as well.

1157
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So before it was

1158
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
that your Frost Skills

1159
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
have a chance,

1160
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
a Lucky Hit chance

1161
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
to make your next

1162
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
cast of a few

1163
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,000
different skills

1164
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
consume Nomada

1165
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and be stronger.

1166
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And when you hit

1167
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Vulnerable Enemies,

1168
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
it just made the

1169
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,000
chance better.

1170
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And now we're just

1171
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
buffing up the chance

1172
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
baseline going from

1173
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
10 to 30% to get that

1174
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
free cast and bonus

1175
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,000
damage.

1176
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But now the actual

1177
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
damage that you deal

1178
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,000
is going to be

1179
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
increased by your

1180
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Damage Against

1181
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Vulnerable Enemies stat.

1182
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So now we've added

1183
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
basically a scaling

1184
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
multiplier to this

1185
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
key passive,

1186
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
so it should be doing

1187
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,000
a lot more damage

1188
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
over time.

1189
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Next we've got

1190
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Aspect of Piercing

1191
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Cold.

1192
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This is for you

1193
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Ice Shards enjoyers.

1194
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
This one's getting

1195
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
a whole lot better.

1196
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So before it used to

1197
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
be that the number

1198
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
of pierces was part

1199
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
of the random roll

1200
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and then also the

1201
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
roll made it deal,

1202
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
your subsequent hits

1203
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
deal less damage with

1204
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Ice Shards.

1205
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And now we flip the

1206
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
script now and now

1207
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
the amount of enemies

1208
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
that it's going to

1209
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,000
pierce is going to be

1210
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
static, so you're just

1211
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
getting more consistent

1212
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
value.

1213
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But instead of

1214
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
doing less damage,

1215
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
you're going to deal

1216
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
more damage per enemy

1217
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,000
hit.

1218
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So that actual

1219
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
difference of going

1220
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
from less to more is

1221
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
going to amount to a

1222
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
substantial increase in

1223
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
the amount of damage

1224
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
that this legendary is

1225
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
pumping out for Ice

1226
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Shards.

1227
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's a huge spread.

1228
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Last but not least,

1229
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
for the Sorceress,

1230
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
we introduced a couple

1231
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
of new legendary

1232
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
aspects in Vessel of

1233
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Hatred.

1234
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,000
We've got them,

1235
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
they're scaling with

1236
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Charge Bolts and

1237
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Incinerate.

1238
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And both of these

1239
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
aspects were dealing

1240
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
what we call flat

1241
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,000
damage, or it was

1242
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
like a certain damage

1243
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
amount.

1244
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And it didn't really

1245
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
scale up as you

1246
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
scaled the skill up.

1247
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And we've changed

1248
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
that for both of

1249
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,000
these.

1250
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So the aspect of

1251
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Charge Flash and

1252
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the aspect of

1253
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Overheating will now

1254
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
both scale.

1255
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
As you get more

1256
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Charge Bolt or more

1257
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Incinerate damage,

1258
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
these ones will be

1259
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
dealing a lot more

1260
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
damage as well.

1261
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So these ones will

1262
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
just scale with you

1263
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and be a lot better

1264
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
over time as you get

1265
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
stronger.

1266
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And next, last but

1267
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
not least, we got

1268
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
the Spirit Borm.

1269
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So we did do some

1270
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
changes here.

1271
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We really mostly did

1272
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,000
small buffs to

1273
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
skills that haven't

1274
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
really been being

1275
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
used or seen less

1276
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,000
success.

1277
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
So we got Razor

1278
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Wings here.

1279
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The damage is going

1280
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,000
up a bit.

1281
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And also Razor

1282
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Wings used to have

1283
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,000
actually a set

1284
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
cooldown between

1285
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
casts.

1286
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And now we remove

1287
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
that cooldown so

1288
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,000
now you can actually

1289
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
cast Razor Wings

1290
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
faster as you build

1291
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
attack speed like all

1292
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
other skills in the

1293
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,000
game.

1294
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
We also did some

1295
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,000
small buffs to

1296
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Withering Fist.

1297
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The poison damage

1298
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,000
went up, the slow

1299
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
went up, and one of

1300
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
the upgrades will now

1301
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,000
spread to more

1302
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
targets when you use

1303
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
it.

1304
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And then we also

1305
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
got some buffs to

1306
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Toxic Skin, which

1307
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
isn't really seen

1308
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,000
much play by

1309
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
players.

1310
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
We basically just

1311
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,000
did some small

1312
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
buffs to damage

1313
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
both baseline, the

1314
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
enhancement, and one

1315
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
of the upgrades, the

1316
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,000
variants of it.

1317
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And these are

1318
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
mostly just on the

1319
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
skills that people

1320
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
aren't actually using

1321
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,000
right now.

1322
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Our goal isn't to

1323
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,000
make the Spirit

1324
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Borm even stronger.

1325
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
No, this is tuning

1326
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
within the builds

1327
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,000
of the cluster.

1328
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
We're most definitely

1329
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
seeing Chad and

1330
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,000
they're like, wait,

1331
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Spirit Borm buffs, and

1332
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
it's like, these are

1333
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
like skills that

1334
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
really no one is

1335
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
using, so we want

1336
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
to make sure that

1337
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I mean, I can

1338
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
spuff Quill Volley.

1339
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
There you go,

1340
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Quill Volley.

1341
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Most definitely

1342
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
needs buffs,

1343
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
apparently.

1344
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
No, but it's for

1345
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
things that we just

1346
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
haven't seen a lot

1347
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
of play within

1348
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Spirit Borm players.

1349
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And I know a lot

1350
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,000
of players are

1351
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,000
looking at some

1352
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
of the numbers,

1353
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,000
and they're also,

1354
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
these are just

1355
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,000
like baseline numbers

1356
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
on some of these

1357
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,000
skills.

1358
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Obviously, there's

1359
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
a lot of

1360
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,000
interactions that

1361
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
happen beyond that

1362
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
from tempering to

1363
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
the gear that you

1364
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
have and everything

1365
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
like that that will

1366
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
end up obviously

1367
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
enhancing those

1368
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
even more.

1369
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So we're expecting

1370
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
to, as Adam

1371
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
mentioned before,

1372
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
we're not expecting

1373
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
to see the other

1374
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
classes jump up to

1375
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
the same power as

1376
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,000
the Spirit Borm,

1377
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
because the Spirit

1378
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Borm, again, is

1379
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
using some unintended

1380
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
interactions right

1381
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
now, but those

1382
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
will be addressed

1383
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
in Season 7.

1384
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So with these

1385
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,000
classes specifically,

1386
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,000
they will get some

1387
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
additional buffs so

1388
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
that they can stay

1389
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
competitive amongst

1390
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,000
each other.

1391
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,000
They're staying

1392
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
together as a pack

1393
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
but being a little

1394
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,000
bit stronger here

1395
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
with the Mid-Season.

1396
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, the idea

1397
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,000
with Mid-Season,

1398
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
this is probably

1399
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,000
going to be true

1400
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
with most Mid-Season

1401
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
updates, is that

1402
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
we're trying to

1403
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
move everything a

1404
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
little closer together

1405
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and also to set up

1406
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
for the next season

1407
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
where there will be

1408
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
a lot more upheaval.

1409
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So we're like

1410
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
prepping everything

1411
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
to be kind of close.

1412
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Ha ha ha, upheaval.

1413
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh yeah.

1414
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I was like, ha ha ha.

1415
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But you know, we're

1416
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
getting ready for Season

1417
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,000
7, which will be a

1418
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,000
lot more impactful.

1419
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Is that an Easter egg?

1420
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Cool.

1421
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Awesome.

1422
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Well, I know we have a,

1423
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
again, Adam had

1424
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
mentioned that this is

1425
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
just a very small

1426
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
preview.

1427
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah, it's a lot more

1428
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,000
than just that.

1429
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
There's a lot more

1430
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
than just what we

1431
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
showed here.

1432
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That would be the

1433
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
shortest patch notes

1434
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,000
ever.

1435
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But we do actually

1436
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
have a patch notes

1437
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
coming out later this

1438
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
week that will have

1439
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
all the different

1440
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,000
class changes and

1441
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
everything with the

1442
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Mid-Season update.

1443
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
We do have a few

1444
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
other things that are

1445
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
actually also hitting

1446
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
related to Rune words

1447
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
and a thing that a lot

1448
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,000
of people have been

1449
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
talking about, which is

1450
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
shrines specifically.

1451
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yes.

1452
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So we can shrines.

1453
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What's wrong with

1454
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,000
shrines?

1455
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What's wrong with

1456
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
shrines?

1457
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What's wrong with

1458
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,000
the Conduit shrine

1459
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
that I don't

1460
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,000
purposely ignore?

1461
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah.

1462
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You mean the real

1463
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,000
cursed shrine?

1464
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,000
There you go.

1465
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,000
All right.

1466
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Jumping into Rune

1467
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Words first.

1468
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We are doing some

1469
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
tuning changes to

1470
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Rune Words.

1471
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I will tease a little

1472
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
bit that we do have

1473
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
some more impactful

1474
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
changes coming in

1475
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Season 7, so tune in

1476
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
next week for them.

1477
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But in the meantime,

1478
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,000
we did do some

1479
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Rune Word buffs to

1480
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
ones that aren't being

1481
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
used as much, mostly

1482
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,000
by lowering offering

1483
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
costs.

1484
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Some examples here,

1485
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
we got the Moni

1486
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Rune Word, the

1487
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,000
offering that you

1488
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
get is increased

1489
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
from 25 to 35.

1490
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The Ahu Rune Word,

1491
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
the offering is

1492
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,000
being increased a

1493
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
lot from 10 to 25

1494
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
when hitting injured

1495
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,000
enemies.

1496
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And then I'm just

1497
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,000
going to butcher it.

1498
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I don't know how to

1499
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
say it, but the

1500
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Seh Rune Word.

1501
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The Wolf Spirits are

1502
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
now always going to

1503
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
be unhindered.

1504
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So we often run into

1505
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
issues where companions

1506
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and things like that

1507
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
have trouble getting

1508
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
to enemies, but since

1509
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
they're spirits, so

1510
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
why would other

1511
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
things get in the way?

1512
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So now they'll always

1513
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,000
be moving through

1514
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
enemies and getting

1515
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
to their targets a lot

1516
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,000
quicker.

1517
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And then Shrines,

1518
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
you know, heard some

1519
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
feedback that they

1520
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
don't really scale

1521
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,000
too well.

1522
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So the Artillery,

1523
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Blast Wave, and

1524
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Conduit Shrines will

1525
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
now deal more damage

1526
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
and they're going to

1527
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
scale with you based

1528
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
on your level and

1529
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
your Paragon level.

1530
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So as you level up,

1531
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
as you get stronger,

1532
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
the Shrines will be

1533
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
getting more potent

1534
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
with you.

1535
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We're going to kind of

1536
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,000
test it, you know,

1537
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
let us know how it

1538
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
goes, see if you

1539
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
actually enjoy getting

1540
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
them and want to get

1541
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,000
them now.

1542
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We do see some room

1543
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
maybe to do some more

1544
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
things above them

1545
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
further if needed, but

1546
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,000
we're going to be

1547
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
trying this as a first

1548
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
step to see how it

1549
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,000
goes.

1550
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah, I know we've

1551
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
heard from a lot of

1552
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,000
people about, like,

1553
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,000
especially as you get

1554
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
to later levels and

1555
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
you're towards, like,

1556
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Endgame and Torment

1557
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
4 and a Conduit

1558
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Shrine appears and

1559
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
it's like, don't touch

1560
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
it because maybe that

1561
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
will make things slower,

1562
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
which it currently

1563
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
typically does for a

1564
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
lot of players,

1565
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
especially Spirit-born

1566
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,000
players.

1567
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So it's cool to see

1568
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
updates to these

1569
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
shrines.

1570
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And again, like,

1571
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
feedback is really

1572
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
important for us to

1573
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
know, like, hey, did

1574
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
we hit the mark?

1575
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Do we need to do

1576
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
additional things or

1577
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
do we need to tweak

1578
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,000
anything?

1579
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So let us know after

1580
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
you guys get a chance

1581
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
to check out the new

1582
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
adjustments to the

1583
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,000
shrines.

1584
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So that'll be really

1585
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,000
important for us.

1586
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Some other things that

1587
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
are coming down the

1588
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
line, we do have some

1589
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
in-game specific events

1590
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and items that we'll be

1591
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
hitting here in the

1592
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
coming weeks?

1593
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Weeks?

1594
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's a little bit

1595
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
after mid-season update.

1596
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
We do actually have

1597
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
another, we're bringing

1598
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
back the Red Clock

1599
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Horror, which is part of

1600
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
the Midwinter Blight

1601
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
event that we had last

1602
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,000
year.

1603
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And we'll actually have

1604
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
a blog that details all

1605
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the benefits and rewards

1606
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
out of this.

1607
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It's like XP benefits,

1608
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
of course, that do come

1609
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
with this specifically,

1610
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,000
which is really great to

1611
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
have on top of another

1612
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
event that's coming,

1613
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
which is Mother's

1614
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Blessing.

1615
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And Mother's Blessing

1616
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
will also be, we'll have

1617
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
that in the blog.

1618
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
That blog is going to be

1619
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
hitting on Thursday, I

1620
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,000
believe.

1621
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So keep an eye out.

1622
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
For Eternal players, we

1623
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
also have a cool little

1624
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
thing, kind of like a

1625
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
welcome back booster type

1626
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
of event for them, or

1627
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
maybe it's not an event.

1628
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I don't know how to coin

1629
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
it, but Colin, what does

1630
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
that entail?

1631
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Yeah, so we wanted to

1632
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
put together just

1633
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
something to get you

1634
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
back into the action.

1635
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I know part of X1 ended

1636
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
up sort of marking a bunch

1637
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
of items as legacy, so we

1638
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,000
just wanted to give

1639
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
everyone a one-time booster

1640
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
to come back.

1641
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
We're going to level you

1642
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,000
to 50.

1643
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
We'll give you a build

1644
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
that we've made.

1645
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
We've made three different

1646
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
ones per class.

1647
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You'll be able to use it.

1648
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm sure everyone watching

1649
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
probably doesn't care,

1650
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
but you will care about

1651
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,000
this if you haven't done

1652
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
this, is we're going to

1653
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
unlock all the altars of

1654
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Lilith as part of that

1655
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,000
boost.

1656
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So if you log in and just

1657
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
use it, and you haven't

1658
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,000
got all your altars,

1659
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
your altars for free,

1660
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
easy peasy nuts.

1661
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah, and if you're a

1662
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
base game, Diablo 4,

1663
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
owner, you'll end up

1664
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
getting, I believe, one

1665
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
of those boosts, and then

1666
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,000
if you're a vessel of

1667
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
hatred, you'll end up

1668
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
getting two of those

1669
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
boosts on eternal

1670
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
characters, which is kind

1671
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,000
of cool.

1672
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
So if you want to jump

1673
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
back in or anything,

1674
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
especially after the

1675
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
changes with, there goes

1676
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,000
my earpiece.

1677
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I've been fumbling with

1678
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
it all day, and now it's

1679
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,000
gone.

1680
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
But I know a lot of

1681
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
players, specifically with

1682
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Season 6 jumping back in,

1683
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
they notice, as you

1684
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
mentioned, a lot of the

1685
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
gear went to legacy gear,

1686
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
so this kind of gives them

1687
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
a way of being able to

1688
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
kind of recover some of

1689
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,000
that.

1690
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Yeah, refreshes it.

1691
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And then I believe we also

1692
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
have another free trial

1693
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
coming up for any new

1694
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
players that want to check

1695
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
out the Spirit Born.

1696
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
The Spirit Born will

1697
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
actually be part of the

1698
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
free trial, and that will

1699
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
be coming up here in the

1700
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,000
coming weeks.

1701
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And so all this will be in a

1702
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
blog on Thursday, which is

1703
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
really cool.

1704
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And then, of course, as we

1705
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
mentioned at the start of

1706
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
the show, we have another

1707
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
stream next week.

1708
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We'll actually have a date

1709
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
for the stream later this

1710
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
week for players so that

1711
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
you guys can keep an eye

1712
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
out for that.

1713
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
But that is our Patch 2.1

1714
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
PTR stream, and that one

1715
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
will be pretty beefy.

1716
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
We have a lot to talk about

1717
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
regarding Patch 2.1 and,

1718
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
of course, everything that's

1719
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
going to be coming with

1720
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Season 7.

1721
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We are super stoked for

1722
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,000
that.

1723
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
The stream, again, will be a

1724
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
little early because of the

1725
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Thanksgiving holiday, so a

1726
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
little bit earlier than when

1727
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
PTR is going to start.

1728
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
We do plan on having those

1729
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
notes available for players

1730
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
before the Thanksgiving

1731
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
holiday, and then I would

1732
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
expect that PTR to start

1733
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
after the Thanksgiving

1734
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
holiday, so when everyone

1735
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
is back in post-holiday and

1736
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
is able to monitor and see

1737
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
how everything is going with

1738
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
PTR and taking the

1739
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,000
feedback.

1740
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So we'll have a stream next

1741
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,000
week.

1742
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You'll see, of course, some

1743
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
of us back on stream next

1744
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,000
week for that.

1745
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And I believe we'll be

1746
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
joined by Mr. Dan Tanguay

1747
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
again, who will be in

1748
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Albany and chiming in on all

1749
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
the stuff that's coming with

1750
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Season 7 and Patch 2.1.

1751
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So lots of big changes

1752
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
coming specifically with

1753
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,000
that.

1754
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I know we do want to jump

1755
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
into some Q&A really

1756
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,000
quickly.

1757
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So if you guys have any

1758
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
questions, we have chat

1759
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
enabled on Twitch, so

1760
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
twitch.tv slash Diablo.

1761
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
If you're watching on other

1762
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
channels and stuff like that,

1763
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
that's where we do take in

1764
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
specific questions.

1765
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But feel free to drop in any

1766
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000
questions.

1767
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
We'll try to get through as

1768
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
many as we can here.

1769
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Again, this is just kind of an

1770
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
abbreviated stream for the

1771
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
mid-season update, and then

1772
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
we'll be back in a week.

1773
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Next week, yeah.

1774
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I get it.

1775
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
We took a little bit of a

1776
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000
break from streaming, so it

1777
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
kind of makes sense.

1778
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So we'll be back pretty

1779
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,000
quickly.

1780
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But I know our first

1781
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
question that we have is

1782
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
related to ancestral items.

1783
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
We get a lot of questions

1784
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
about ancestral items.

1785
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I've seen a lot of

1786
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,000
questions.

1787
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Oh, this earpiece is

1788
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
driving me nuts.

1789
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Question number one.

1790
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Adam, fix your earpiece.

1791
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
There's a plant right here,

1792
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
which you guys can't see, so

1793
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm having to read the

1794
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,000
screen.

1795
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Any updates to ancestral

1796
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
items?

1797
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Do you guys have any

1798
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
updates or news to share

1799
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
regarding that?

1800
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, I know we saw a lot

1801
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
of confusion in terms of

1802
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
maxing out a lot of the

1803
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Codex of Power.

1804
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
In X1, we actually added

1805
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
roughly what we call ranks,

1806
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
five ranks, to a lot of the

1807
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
legendary aspects that were

1808
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
ancestral only.

1809
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And I know that caused a lot

1810
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,000
of confusion.

1811
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So currently how it works is

1812
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
ancestral items have a

1813
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
higher upper bounds on the

1814
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
rank that you can achieve for

1815
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,000
that aspect.

1816
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And we have seen quite a

1817
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
bit of people struggling to

1818
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
max out their aspects.

1819
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Generally, that was the goal

1820
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
is that we do want to

1821
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,000
grind, right?

1822
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Like we think it's good that

1823
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
you can sort of get an

1824
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
aspect right away.

1825
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
But we like that once you

1826
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,000
have that play style

1827
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
assembled, we still want

1828
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
things that you need to

1829
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
work on.

1830
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
That being said, we think

1831
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,000
it's a little bit too

1832
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
aggressive right now.

1833
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So we are going to be

1834
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
making some changes, which

1835
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
we will detail next week, in

1836
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
terms of how that actually

1837
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,000
works.

1838
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But just know that

1839
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
currently ancestral items are

1840
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
the sort of where you find

1841
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
the max rank of a lot of

1842
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,000
those aspects.

1843
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But you can still find them

1844
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
on anything else that isn't

1845
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
ancestral, the lower version.

1846
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Yeah.

1847
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I know, and we'll be talking

1848
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
more about ancestral items

1849
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
next week.

1850
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Specifically.

1851
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,000
The drop rates.

1852
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, a lot of stuff

1853
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,000
regarding that.

1854
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Is there any plans?

1855
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
This is, I'm taking a few

1856
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
questions from the forums

1857
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and of course chat because we

1858
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
did post this on the forums

1859
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
beforehand.

1860
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Urza from the forum says,

1861
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
can we get boss materials to

1862
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
stack like runes or maybe

1863
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
even higher?

1864
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Are there any plans for

1865
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,000
something like that?

1866
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Yeah, we are looking into it.

1867
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
There's things on our side in

1868
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
terms of like storage and

1869
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
duping that we're a little bit

1870
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
worried about, but we're

1871
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
looking at making a change

1872
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
sometime in the longer future.

1873
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Question from a couple people

1874
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
like Archangel890 and Dragonage

1875
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
says, any chances that you guys

1876
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
will potentially change like XP

1877
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
gain, maybe the growth to

1878
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Paragon 300?

1879
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Is there any plans on maybe

1880
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
making adjustments or tuning

1881
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
specifically on that end?

1882
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Currently, not at the moment.

1883
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I think it's something we're

1884
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
monitoring though in terms of

1885
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
the feedback. We do like that

1886
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
you can get just about

1887
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
everything within the first

1888
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
200 Paragon levels and

1889
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
everything from there has a

1890
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
pretty steep diminishing

1891
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
return in terms of power.

1892
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So what we don't want to say

1893
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
to you all is like you need

1894
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
to grind 200 hours to unlock

1895
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
your build and do all the

1896
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
things that are sort of

1897
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
play style defining, which we

1898
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
define as like the sort of

1899
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
glyphs and the legendary

1900
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
nodes. So we've seen actually

1901
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
a lot of positive feedback

1902
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that like you can get your

1903
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
build online and that you

1904
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
still have something to work

1905
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
towards. The sooner we sort of

1906
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
short circuit that Paragon

1907
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
grind, the more we sort of

1908
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
get back to that pre-expansion

1909
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
one state where you just

1910
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
don't get anything from

1911
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
killing monsters because

1912
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
you're Paragon 300 in the

1913
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
first two weekends. So

1914
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
currently, you know, we're

1915
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
looking at monitoring it and

1916
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000
we're super open to the

1917
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
feedback. But so far we've

1918
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
seen a good amount of

1919
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
positivity around it.

1920
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I think it's kind of in

1921
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,000
line with what you're talking

1922
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
about with the legendary

1923
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
powers, right? Like those

1924
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
last five ranks are on

1925
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Ancestral Items only. And so

1926
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
our idea is like we want you

1927
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
to get your build online and

1928
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
play the way you want within a

1929
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
pretty, you know, pretty

1930
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
quickly or whatever. But then

1931
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
you have something to work

1932
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
towards like incrementally to

1933
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
become stronger and stronger

1934
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and that we're okay with

1935
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
taking a long time. Totally.

1936
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
As long as it's not like

1937
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
cutting you off from the

1938
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
build at all. Yeah. It's

1939
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
about getting you into the

1940
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
fun and like making sure

1941
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
that your build is blasting

1942
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
but you have things to sort of

1943
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
use that build to blast for.

1944
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Right. That makes sense.

1945
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Yeah. And I think there's

1946
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
like the other thing that

1947
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
people are probably forgetting

1948
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
about is like we do have

1949
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
these events coming up and

1950
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
stuff which also benefit.

1951
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
which will be boosting

1952
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
it all. And everything

1953
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
like that which will be a

1954
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
good opportunity for

1955
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
players to like be able to

1956
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
you know if they really

1957
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
want because they're as

1958
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
we've seen there are there

1959
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
is a reward to for getting

1960
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
to Paragon 300 and stuff.

1961
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So it allows players that

1962
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
opportunity to kind of use

1963
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
those events to be able to

1964
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
boost that. And we have

1965
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
obviously Red Pill Core

1966
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
stuff coming up here. And

1967
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
of course we have Mother's

1968
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Blessing. So there's

1969
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
opportunities to help with

1970
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
some of that XP based off

1971
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
of those events specifically.

1972
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So there is a question

1973
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
regarding like materials

1974
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
again. You know can we

1975
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
expect any additional buffs

1976
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
for drop rates on Rawhide,

1977
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Iron, Forgotten Souls,

1978
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
anything like that?

1979
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Yeah. So actually it is in

1980
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
the midseason but we did

1981
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
buff Legion events. I know

1982
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
that was a personal favorite

1983
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
of a lot of folks for the

1984
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
midseason. For season seven

1985
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
we're taking a look at just

1986
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
sort of buffing the various

1987
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
sources and also really

1988
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
drilling down on like what

1989
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
are the bottlenecks players

1990
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
are having and iterating

1991
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
towards that. There's no

1992
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
major changes coming in

1993
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
season seven. Like we're

1994
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
not going to quadruple the

1995
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
amount of materials across

1996
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
the game. But it is

1997
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
something again in the

1998
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
spirit of like tightening

1999
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
the things that we have.

2000
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
We are actively looking at

2001
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,000
a lot of the material

2002
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
inflows and outflows and

2003
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
we want to give you the

2004
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
tools to sort of get the

2005
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
materials that you're

2006
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
looking for. We're sort of

2007
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
what we're trying to do is

2008
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
ensure that there are

2009
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
things that you still care

2010
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
about. Right. And you still

2011
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
want to grind. It's still in

2012
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
that spirit of like it's

2013
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
walking that fine line of

2014
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
there are things to work

2015
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
towards without it feeling

2016
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
super tedious. So that's

2017
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,000
what we're trying to

2018
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
tighten and work towards.

2019
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
There is a question

2020
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
regarding this from Remster

2021
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Ma says do you have any

2022
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
plans and start bringing in

2023
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
new midseason mechanics? I

2024
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
think for that more so I

2025
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
would expect like larger

2026
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
mechanics content changes and

2027
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
stuff like that to happen

2028
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
around new seasons as

2029
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
opposed to a midseason

2030
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
update. I think we look at

2031
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
taking midseason updates

2032
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
making tweaks to you know

2033
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
balance items or anything

2034
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
that we're hearing feedback

2035
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
from so that we can spend

2036
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
most of our you know

2037
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
concentration and focus on

2038
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
really putting in some of

2039
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
these newer type of content

2040
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
pieces around new seasons

2041
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
specifically. Yeah I think

2042
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
you think going forward is

2043
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
midseason is a time to just

2044
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
like tweak and iterate and

2045
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
you know use rework existing

2046
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
things but we're really

2047
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
putting all of our books on

2048
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
like bigger upheavals you

2049
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
know larger changes lots of

2050
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
new stuff into the beginning

2051
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
of the season. So next week

2052
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
will be pretty exciting we

2053
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
got a lot of new stuff

2054
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
coming in but that's where

2055
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
we're kind of targeting that

2056
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,000
to make that kind of a big

2057
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
moment and exciting time to

2058
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
come back and play. There is

2059
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
a question from casual

2060
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
dragon regarding under city

2061
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
drops and asking is there any

2062
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
plans to potentially fix those

2063
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
make those better specifically

2064
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
on that end. Yeah so this

2065
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
sort of leads into there are

2066
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
some ancestral drop rate

2067
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,000
changes that we want to talk

2068
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
about next week but in

2069
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
general what that'll mean is

2070
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
all the loot across the game

2071
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
will generally get better so

2072
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
it is something that we're

2073
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
working on. I'm about to take

2074
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
this earpiece and throw it

2075
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
across the room because it

2076
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
just keeps popping out and

2077
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
it's driving me insane. That's

2078
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
a question from PezRadar. The

2079
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
question from Finamdar says

2080
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Diablo any at Diablo any

2081
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
stability fixes coming and

2082
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
seeing a whole lot more

2083
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
crashes since the last couple

2084
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
patches. I will say that we've

2085
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
been monitoring we can actually

2086
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
see whenever a player actually

2087
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,000
crashes. We know it we get

2088
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
logs from it on our end. I know

2089
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
that the engineering team here

2090
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
has been doing a ton of work on

2091
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
working to get the game more

2092
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
stable. You've probably seen a

2093
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
bunch of different small

2094
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
client patches go out. We

2095
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
actually just re-enabled like

2096
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
DLSS in a client patch that

2097
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
went out yesterday. There are

2098
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
additional changes and more

2099
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
reviewing that's being done from

2100
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
our side to ensure that you

2101
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
know the game is running very

2102
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
stable so expect to see more of

2103
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
that as we get through this

2104
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
season and of course into next

2105
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
season because our goal is to

2106
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
make sure you know baseline

2107
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
everyone can jump in without

2108
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
any of these types of issues

2109
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and everything. And shout out

2110
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
to our engineering team. I know

2111
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
they've been working long and

2112
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
hard on figuring all this stuff

2113
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
out. They've been that's like

2114
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
their top priority right now.

2115
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
They actually behind the scenes

2116
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
we even collaborate with them a

2117
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
lot on doing various things

2118
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
related to game performance

2119
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
under the hood like making

2120
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
skills cleaner making

2121
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
interactions cleaner like we're

2122
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
constantly doing stuff to make

2123
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
the game run smoother in the

2124
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
background pretty much every

2125
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
patch like we're fixing multiple

2126
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
things so it's definitely

2127
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
something that we're always

2128
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,000
working on actively.

2129
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Why so blue panda bear? Any

2130
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
chance on tempering schools can

2131
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
be used more than once?

2132
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Investing time to finally get a

2133
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
rare drop and it bricks kind of

2134
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
doesn't feel too great.

2135
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Any thoughts on tempering

2136
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
schools how that's been going?

2137
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Yeah I think it's definitely

2138
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
something we hear a lot of

2139
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
feedback on and it's something

2140
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
that you know we were sort of

2141
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
taking incremental approach right

2142
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
like with the X1 or the expansion

2143
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
one changes we made it so that a

2144
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
lot of recipes are three. We also

2145
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
added of course the scroll of

2146
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
tempering or restoration in

2147
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
expansion one to see how that

2148
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
sort of changes things. So we're

2149
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
just really taking a measured

2150
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
approach. If we see still there's

2151
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
a lot of feedback that it just

2152
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
still isn't hitting that mark

2153
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
we're absolutely open to changing

2154
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
things like potentially letting it

2155
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
be used more than once and we're

2156
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
just sort of monitoring at this

2157
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
point. We are getting questions

2158
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
about the Armory. Stay tuned. TM.

2159
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Soon. TM. We'll have

2160
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
information on that. As you guys

2161
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
know that that has been in

2162
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
development something that we've

2163
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
already confirmed about. I will be

2164
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
talking more about it here soon. TM.

2165
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So keep your eyes peeled. Is that the

2166
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
term? Keep your eyes peeled. I don't

2167
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
know. There's a saying that you know

2168
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
stay tuned. I don't know. Last question

2169
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
here that we have before we head off

2170
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
is Holes Transition says will Dance and

2171
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Knives get buffs and any changes to be

2172
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
more compatible with collecting loot

2173
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
like opening doors etc. You know when

2174
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
you're when you're going you're

2175
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
spinning to win with your knives and

2176
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
stuff is there any way of or any

2177
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
plans of potentially having them

2178
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
seamlessly move around around a

2179
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
dungeon or something like that from

2180
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
that. Nothing on my radar right now

2181
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
but that's a good note to take. It's a

2182
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
good note to take. It's a good to

2183
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
note to take. Rogues want to spin to

2184
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
win. And never stop. Ever. You have to

2185
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
do all this setup and snapshot and then

2186
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
you have to like open the door so we do

2187
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
know it's a thing. Yeah. So we'll see.

2188
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Stay tuned. Stay tuned. It's another

2189
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
thing to stay tuned. So again thanks

2190
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
again everyone for jumping in providing

2191
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
questions and everything from our end.

2192
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
We will have patch notes later this

2193
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
week so stay tuned for that. The blogs

2194
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
for Mother's Blessing, the Red Cloak

2195
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Horror, our Eternal Boost stuff,

2196
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
everything will be out on Thursday. So

2197
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
also check out for that blog. Midseason

2198
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
update hits next week so patch notes

2199
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
will be out before the midseason

2200
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
update and you guys will also hear

2201
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
about our stream date next week for

2202
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
the Patch 2.1 PTR. So we'll be talking

2203
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
a whole bunch. That will be another

2204
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
beefy stream. Yeah. I know it's a little

2205
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
bit short. That one's going to be a

2206
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
little bit more beefy than this one.

2207
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
But look at this. Two streams in two

2208
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
weeks. We're about to do it. So we will

2209
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
see you guys next week. Again huge

2210
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
thanks to Colin, Adam for joining us.

2211
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Our wonderful Mini Cosrote over here.

2212
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Super awesome. Super cute. Love you

2213
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Aaron. So but thank you guys. We'll see

2214
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
you guys next week for our Patch 2.1

2215
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
PTR stream. And yeah. Check out the

2216
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
blogs and patch notes later this week.

2217
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
See you guys.
