Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you.

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you.

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thank you.

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you.

14
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you.

15
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you.

16
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Thank you.

17
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you.

18
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Thank you.

19
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you.

20
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you.

21
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you.

22
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you.

23
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you.

24
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you.

25
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you.

26
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you.

27
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you.

28
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you.

29
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Thank you.

30
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Thank you.

31
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Thank you.

32
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you.

33
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thank you.

34
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Thank you.

35
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Thank you.

36
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Thank you.

37
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you.

38
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Thank you.

39
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Thank you.

40
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Thank you.

41
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Thank you.

42
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Thank you.

43
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Thank you.

44
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Thank you.

45
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Thank you.

46
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Thank you.

47
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Thank you.

48
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Thank you.

49
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Thank you.

50
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Thank you.

51
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Thank you.

52
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000


53
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
normal animations.

54
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I was like, yes, that's it.

55
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's what hatred should feel like.

56
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
When you first find the Priestess of Hatred, it's going to look like a lifeless human corpse.

57
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And you're like, this doesn't look like a boss fight.

58
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm in a boss arena.

59
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What's going on?

60
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But as you approach, you see that the body gets pulled into a giant pool of hatred.

61
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And then out of that pool of hatred comes this giant mass of tentacles.

62
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And that is the boss.

63
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So after animation, it gets to come to me.

64
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And I get to do all of the really cool visual effects at the end.

65
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Show what those tentacles are doing when they impact the ground.

66
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
When they slap something.

67
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
When they hit the player.

68
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It really brings the entire thing together.

69
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The vomit attack is really gross because there's like this part of the torso of the humanoid

70
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that has been kind of hollowed out and now has teeth.

71
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The tentacles come out from the mass and they grab the humanoid and kind of pull the body

72
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
back so that the slit in the belly opens up and all of the hatred just pours out a straight

73
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
beam.

74
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's pretty gross.

75
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The hollows are just such a unique family.

76
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
From the moment they spawn in on your screen, you can tell that they are different.

77
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
They have just such unique behaviors and animations.

78
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
We were able to execute on a vision that's really just so different than what we typically do.

79
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The whole process made me feel very proud of our whole team.

80
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Everyone just got it.

81
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
They understood what the monster was.

82
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
They got the vision.

83
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And it just worked.

84
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
They got the vision.

85
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The eye on the screen has many functions.

86
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It keeps me in the right frame of mind.

87
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What we are doing is dark.

88
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It should be horrifying.

89
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I should feel the fear while I'm doing it.

90
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's a reminder of that.

91
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
The eye also serves as a warning.

92
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Get moving.

93
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Don't dwell too long and wander around.

94
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Get this thing moving.

95
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Get the work done.

96
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Get the work done.

97
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm just shuffling papers trying to grab something really quickly.

98
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Welcome to another Diablo 4 campfire chat.

99
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
My name is Adam Fletcher.

100
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Of course, I'm joined by two familiar faces on our campfire chats.

101
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We have Mr. Adam Jackson and Mr. Colin Feiner.

102
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Hello everyone.

103
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's been a little while since we've seen everyone.

104
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We obviously have lots of it has changed since our last stream.

105
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We ended up launching Vessel of Hatred which is really awesome to see.

106
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Tons of players online checking out all the new features within Diablo 4 and of course

107
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
the Spiritborn as well.

108
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
We've been hearing a lot about the Spiritborn.

109
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It seems a little obvious.

110
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Awesome.

111
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah.

112
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Awesome.

113
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's too weak.

114
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's too weak.

115
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That's what we've heard.

116
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That's apparently what we most definitely heard.

117
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But no, it is a little strong and we've heard that from a lot of people.

118
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We'll be talking about that a little bit today.

119
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But first, before we do jump in, I do want to talk about some plans, upcoming plans that

120
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
we have for streams.

121
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Obviously we're doing this stream right now for the mid-season update.

122
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The mid-season update is actually currently scheduled to release next week.

123
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We won't have patch notes immediately after this stream.

124
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
As you know, we're doing this stream on a Tuesday which is a little bit of a different

125
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
day for us.

126
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We typically end up doing these streams later in the week when we do release those patch

127
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
notes.

128
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But you will have patch notes later this week.

129
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We just need to get them through localization, make sure everyone sees them and we get all

130
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the final changes in them before we actually do release them.

131
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But you will have the final patch notes for mid-season update later this week.

132
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And then again, mid-season update next week.

133
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We will be back next week for another stream.

134
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah.

135
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So back-to-back weeks for streams.

136
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Lots of streams coming up.

137
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So this one is going to be a pretty quick one to go over mid-season update.

138
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And then next week we're actually going to talk about the Season 7 PTR.

139
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
We are going to be talking about all the changes that are coming with patch 2.1.

140
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That stream is also going to be a little earlier than when PTR is planning on actually starting.

141
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's only because for those here in the US that are aware of it, the Thanksgiving holiday is coming up towards the end of November.

142
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And we won't have people in the office.

143
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So we want to make sure that we can do the stream a little early and talk to everyone about the patch 2.1 PTR before the end of the month.

144
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So PTR itself is planning on starting after the holidays or after that Thanksgiving holiday in the US.

145
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And then for the notes regarding PTR, we'll have that before the holidays.

146
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So everyone can get to, at least in the US, they can eat turkey, read patch notes.

147
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And then elsewhere, they can just read patch notes.

148
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And so we have a lot of stuff coming up and a lot to talk about.

149
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But before we do get towards some of the other items, I know, Colin, you want to talk a little bit about where we're at with D4 at the moment?

150
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, absolutely. So I'll try and keep it short and sweet.

151
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
For the midseason, we actually think, I just wanted to talk a little bit about how we think about the game currently.

152
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You know, we've changed a lot over the past year. We've changed itemization. We've changed all of the progression.

153
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And generally, I think, you know, we've seen a ton of positive feedback around a lot of the progression changes made in X1, which is fantastic.

154
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
We're really excited to make a lot of these changes.

155
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I think it's hit a lot of the goals in terms of opening up what builds you can actually play and experience a lot of the endgame, which is great.

156
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Of course, there's, you know, Spiritborn, Kicking Ass, and Pit Tier 150.

157
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But, like, otherwise, there's a lot of builds that sort of can cut it in the endgame, starting in Torment 1.

158
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And I think that's been super, like, sort of successful for us.

159
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And I also think, like, a lot of the sort of itemization changes we've made in terms of ancestral items, we think that, like, they're a little bit on the low side.

160
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
We'll talk a little bit more next week in the PTR in terms of buffing those.

161
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But we think, like, it's actually pretty cool that there's those chase items that people are looking for.

162
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And I think just generally we're pretty happy with how a lot of things landed.

163
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And right now we're sort of taking a step back and seeing, okay, now that we've made a lot of these changes, what are the more iterative steps we're going to take in the next year in terms of, like, tightening up a lot of things?

164
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You know, full disclosure, I think we missed the mark a little bit on material tuning and things like that.

165
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So we're not looking at...

166
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Had to do a couple updates on material tuning.

167
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Just a couple.

168
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah, just a couple.

169
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So we're really looking at tightening up a lot of those things and sort of making more iterative changes to the overall progression of the game.

170
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And we hope that that creates more stability and that sort of lets us, you know, sort of put more time and focus on, like, balance and adding more things and sort of leveling up the game in that sort of way.

171
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, just thinking back a year ago, like, so much has changed in our systems, right?

172
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Like, we did all of our combat math over again.

173
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We changed resistances.

174
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
We changed how loot drops and, you know, the whole upgrade system there in Season 4.

175
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Unique's got a big overhaul.

176
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Like, there's been so much change in things.

177
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm looking forward to having a chance for things to kind of settle down and we can fine-tune and refine the existing systems that we have now that we have so many ways of progressing your character, making yourself stronger.

178
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And I think there's a lot of room for improvement inside of these systems to make them kind of better, which I know people have been requesting a lot.

179
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So we're looking forward to that.

180
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's really about refining what we currently have.

182
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We feel like the structure is really strong right now.

183
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah, most definitely.

184
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And I know with this mid-season update, we, of course, the biggest topic that we've been hearing a lot is around class balance, specifically around, like, Spirit Born right now and how it is performing very well compared to some of the other classes.

185
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And so, Mr. Adam Jackson, I know you wanted to talk a little bit about some of the class balance.

186
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah, let's talk about classes.

187
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We've got a lot to go over today.

188
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So first, just to give an overview of kind of what I'm going to talk about.

189
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
First, we're going to talk a little bit about kind of the state of Season 6 and kind of how we see things and how things are going.

190
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And then we're going to give you a preview of some of the changes that we're going to be doing for all the classes.

191
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Normal disclaimer here, you know, we're not going to be covering everything that we're going to do here in the past.

192
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
There could be a lot more notes than what I'm showing today, but just to kind of give you an idea of what's coming for each class and kind of what you can look forward to.

193
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So, yeah, the current state of Season 6.

194
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So, you know, a whole lot of people are enjoying the Spirit Born.

195
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I think this class has been really successful.

196
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You know, we've been hearing that it's a lot of fun.

197
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
People are really liking kind of the way that you build, the way that you play, and just the class in general, which is really gratifying for the team.

198
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Just for some stats here, 62% of all players have played the Spirit Born.

199
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So, you know, when you think there's six classes in the game now and 62% of people are playing it, you know, that's kind of a lot of love for the class, which is pretty exciting to see.

200
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And to give you a basis of comparison here, the Sorceress in Season 5 was the most played class, and she was at 32%.

201
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So, you know, I'll give you an idea, and that was, you know, Lightning Spear meta, and, you know, this class was really, really good.

202
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
A lot of people had fun.

203
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And so you can kind of compare there of just how many people kind of logged into the expansion and enjoyed that.

204
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So, that's pretty exciting.

205
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yeah, just a few, right?

206
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yeah, so kind of the state of the game.

207
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You know, the Spirit Born is performing quite a bit better than other classes, which we want to dig deep, you know, do a little bit of a deep dive into how and why and how we think about it.

208
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Largely, a big culprit of this is actually due to unintended interactions that the class has with how some things scale and other issues.

209
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But then there's also another component that there are some balance issues with the class itself.

210
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And so it's pretty easy to conflate these two and be like, well, how much of the power is due to, like, you know, bugs or unintended interactions,

211
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and how much of it is just some things have high numbers?

212
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
We do think it's a bit of both, but the unintended interactions, I think, are the lion's share of what's going on here.

213
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But on the bright side, the other classes are actually performing fairly well when compared to one another.

214
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So, if you look at, you know, Barbarian compared to Necromancer or Druid compared to Sorceress,

215
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
they're actually pretty close and competitive when we see, like, pit tier clears and other content how they're doing,

216
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
which is a really good sign for us.

217
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So, when we're thinking of kind of what we're going to do going forward and how we balance the game,

218
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
there's kind of two really statements that we need to think about when it comes to balance.

219
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
The first one that's really important is we want players to feel strong and powerful

220
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and to kind of feel like they can break the game and find these crazy builds and do awesome things with.

221
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And then on the other side of the coin, we also want kind of, you know, class balance and parity

222
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
when it comes to a power level with one another, right?

223
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You know, we don't want a situation that exists for a really long time where, you know,

224
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the only answer is to play Barbarian, for example, compared to everything else,

225
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
and that's all that you kind of be pushed into playing.

226
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So, these two things are kind of at odds with one another,

227
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and we've kind of gone back and forth on our strategies here.

228
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
If you remember back when we launched Diablo 4,

229
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
we really actually prioritized class parity and harmony over, you know, everything else,

230
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
over the power fantasy of the game.

231
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And what this resulted in was every time that someone found a build that was really strong and crazy,

232
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
we just kind of would fix the bugs or nerf the build,

233
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and we ended up kind of playing whack-a-mole every time that players found something cool.

234
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And it ended up being that Blizzard kind of turned into the fun police,

235
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
which players really didn't like.

236
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
We got a pretty big reaction at the end of the launch period and into season one

237
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
when we tried to only think about class parity over kind of the power fantasy of Diablo.

238
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And in season two, we kind of really turned things around in the way that we thought about the game,

239
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and we really prioritized, you know, power fantasy

240
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and this idea that our players kind of want to break the game and be crazy.

241
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The big shining example there was Ball Lightning for you Sorcerous Mains,

242
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
where that skill, you know, had an unintended interaction.

243
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It was really, really good, but players really liked it and had a lot of fun.

244
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And so if you remember a long time ago, we came on livestream and we talked about this,

245
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and we kind of said that we were going to allow players to kind of break the game in this way

246
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
until the next season, right?

247
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
There are some exceptions that we'll make where we'll fix things in the midseason

248
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
if it's impacting, like, the performance of the game or the experience of other players,

249
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
like if your build is causing a bunch of lag or something, then we'll fix it right away.

250
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I think in season six, we had this example with the Evade build with Spiritborn.

251
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
But overall, players really liked this strategy a whole lot more, right?

252
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
They got to enjoy this kind of, the point of playing ARPGs and Diablo in particular,

253
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
of really making a powerful character and being able to smash faces with it, right?

254
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah, and the sort of philosophy here is, sort of goes even beyond classes, right?

255
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
If you remember in season one, we were just nerfing every dungeon that was to perform in,

256
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and like any time there was content that was a little bit out of budget, we'd nerf it.

257
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So it's really about sort of establishing a trust with you, the player, during that season

258
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and not trying to sort of force you to exploit the fun early and often.

259
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And it's really about sort of making sure that when you play a season,

260
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
you know that that season is going to work the same throughout the season

261
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and we're not going to change things midway on you.

262
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, I think another factor to think about too is that now that we've added a lot of progression

263
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
or like tempering and masterworking, that there's a lot of time investment that goes into making a build,

264
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
even if you know something that might be unintended, but it's really, really good and crazy

265
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and you spend, you know, 40 plus, 100 hours, whatever, making it.

266
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And if we kind of pull the rug out from under you, it's worrisome to do that to players, I think,

267
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
in the middle of a season.

268
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's all about respecting your time, right?

269
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah.

270
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So in that vein, we are not planning to nerf the Spiritborn in the midseason patch,

271
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
which I think is the thing that's on everybody's mind.

272
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Like, is Blizzard going to do it?

273
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And we've decided that we think it's best for the game to not do it in the midseason.

274
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So in Season 7, and we'll be talking about this a little more in the livestream next week,

275
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
we are going to be fixing all the unintended interactions that we found with Spiritborn.

276
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
We'll also be making balance adjustments to bring them in line with the other classes.

277
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So you can expect a lot of change there.

278
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But until then, you know, enjoy what you've got now while it's there.

279
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I think it's worth digging into the unintended interactions part too, right?

280
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Because it's not necessarily like you picked one legendary Paragon node

281
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and now your build is ridiculous, right?

282
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's like you're sort of, you know, for lack of a better word,

283
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
abusing some of the mechanics, right?

284
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
If we know, you know, Viscous Shield is scaling off of max HP,

285
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
players have poured tons of time and effort trying to max Masterwork their max life

286
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and getting all the perfect tempers and item affixes,

287
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
we don't want to take that away from you, right?

288
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's not something that we're trying to necessarily destroy

289
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
all the time commitment you put into your character by fixing these things.

290
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So it's not as simple as just fixed unintended interaction, right?

291
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But just reiterating, it is that those unintended interactions

292
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
are things that we will look at when we get to Season 7

293
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and we start off with Season 7.

294
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So obviously with mid-season update, enjoy it.

295
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Enjoy it through Season 6, but come Season 7,

296
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
you'll see a preview of some of these changes with Season 7

297
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
in our PTR stream next week.

298
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You'll see some of the changes that we plan on.

299
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah, there's a lot coming there, but this isn't about that.

300
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
This isn't about that today.

301
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
There's a lot coming there for everybody that'll be really exciting.

302
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But yeah, so...

303
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
But the caveat to all of this is if something does come up

304
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
that impacts other players in regards to the game's performance

305
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
or you're causing lag for the server or whatever,

306
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
we will be fixing those types of interactions as soon as possible.

307
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Like the evade build is our example, right?

308
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We will fix those right away because we want to make sure

309
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
that the game is, you know, performant for everybody.

310
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So in the mid-season, though,

311
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
we are going to be buffing all of the other classes in the mid-season patch,

312
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
but I want to caveat this a little bit with

313
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
it's not going to be to the level of Spiritborn right now

314
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
because a lot of that power is due to bugs and unintended things.

315
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So we're really going to be buffing the classes

316
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
to have more parity and harmony with each other,

317
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
but then also to kind of where we plan to bring the Spiritborn to

318
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
after, you know, the bugs and stuff has been fixed.

319
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So you will be seeing number buffs,

320
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
but, you know, I wouldn't expect to be at the same level

321
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
as what Spiritborn is doing right now in the mid-season,

322
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
just to be clear, because of that.

323
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
The bugs are actually a big part of the power level.

324
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah, and we don't want to create an arms race, right,

325
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
where it's like, okay, everyone gets to be pit tier 150,

326
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
then the next natural ask is like,

327
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
okay, I guess we're adding Torment 5, 6, 7, 8, right?

328
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So we don't want to sort of get to a place

329
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
where, you know, you're cheering through 12 different Torment tiers.

330
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So we're really being cautious about the arms race here.

331
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
We actually think the rest of the classes are in a really good spot.

332
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, and I think you can count on that going forward, too,

333
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
not even just right now,

334
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
but this is kind of the way that we think of things in general.

335
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's like if all the classes are kind of in this realm

336
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
kind of close to each other,

337
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and then one has something unintended

338
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
that brings, like, way up here,

339
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
everybody is always like,

340
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
well, let's just bring everybody else to this.

341
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But if we do that every time,

342
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
like you start with this difference,

343
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and then you're here, and then you do this,

344
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and then you do this,

345
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and you're exponentially going to increase the power level of the game

346
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
just insanely high really fast, right?

347
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And that's not our goal, right?

348
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So if there's something that stands out,

349
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
we'll let people do it for a while,

350
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
but then we're going to bring it back the next season.

351
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And that's kind of the way that I think

352
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
you can mostly count on us doing balance

353
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
and how the choices that we make and why.

354
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Definitely.

355
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And the same goes if there's, like,

356
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
an underperforming class.

357
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It's, like, 20 pit tiers behind everyone else, right?

358
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
We have no problems with, like,

359
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
bringing that up to where the rest of the classes are.

360
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Correct.

361
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah, the real goal is to get everything

362
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
in a pretty good realm of having harmony with one another.

363
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And, you know, when something's out of balance,

364
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
it's okay for a season,

365
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
but then we're going to try to bring it back, right?

366
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
That's kind of always our goal.

367
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So, yeah, let's get into the class updates

368
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,000
for all the classes.

369
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
We're just going to be going through one by one

370
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and kind of giving you a preview of what to see.

371
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Again, this is only a preview.

372
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
There's more than what we're going to show on screen.

373
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah, way more, right?

374
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
This is just, like, a couple examples

375
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
within the stream itself.

376
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And, again, just a reminder,

377
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
patch notes later this week,

378
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
once we get everything kind of sort of

379
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
at normal time for a stream on a Tuesday,

380
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
normally we do it on Thursday

381
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and usually have patch notes then.

382
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So I expect the patch notes later this week.

383
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah, let's get to it.

384
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So starting off with Barbarian,

385
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
we got some baseline core skill buffs

386
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
for pretty much all of them, right?

387
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You can see here, Upheaval, Hammer of the Ancients,

388
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Double Swing, and Rend.

389
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Basically, you know, we always hear it

390
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
that they have a little bit of trouble leveling.

391
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Their late game is really good,

392
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
but just getting there can be a little bit painful.

393
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So we're just going to be squeezing up

394
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
those numbers a little bit more.

395
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So you'll have a better time leveling.

396
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You'll also be a little bit stronger overall,

397
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
but all the builds will get a little bit better.

398
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And then also we have some buffs

399
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
to underperforming legendaries and uniques.

400
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Here's an example with an aspect, Battle Mad.

401
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You can see here in the before,

402
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
kind of what's on live right now

403
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
is it's basically just a way to give you berserking,

404
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
rewarding you for weapon swapping.

405
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And now we're adding a hefty multiplier to it.

406
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So now this is going to be a real offensive aspect

407
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
that's going to give you, you know, a bunch of power.

408
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
You're going to get up to a 40% damage buff

409
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
when you're doing the weapon swapping mechanic.

410
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So we're kind of finding these places

411
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
where we can input damage

412
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
or, you know, these underused legendaries or uniques,

413
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
and then adding a reason to make them more compelling.

414
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Next we've got Druid.

415
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So all of the Druid's key passives are getting buffed.

416
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I've given a couple of examples here,

417
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
but I'm pretty sure all of them, the numbers went up.

418
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So Lupine Ferocity, you've got the crit damage

419
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
going from 70 to 100% bonus,

420
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and then the bonus damage to injured enemies

421
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
going from 140 to 200%, which is pretty meaty.

422
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And then the one with nature passive,

423
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
that buffs your companions.

424
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
That bonus damage is going from 60 to 80%,

425
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
which is a pretty big amount.

426
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
And then also legendary unique buffs

427
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
in the same way of the Barbarian.

428
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So here this is an offensive aspect,

429
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
even though I'd argue it's kind of more utility,

430
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
but the Storm Chasers aspect

431
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
where it makes your Tornado smart,

432
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
where they seek enemies.

433
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
We're just adding a pretty good multiplier to that.

434
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So Tornado builds Rejoice.

435
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You're going to get up to 50% more damage now

436
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
just from taking this aspect

437
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
that you were probably taking anyways.

438
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So just making you happier to take the same things.

439
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Next one, the Basilisk.

440
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
This is the Earth Druid dealing with Petrify.

441
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So before it was that first time

442
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
that you hit an enemy, you'll Petrify them.

443
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And then every time you Petrify them,

444
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
it deals a bunch of damage.

445
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
We're just making that a lot more usable

446
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
so that way you can feel more comfortable taking it.

447
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So now it's going to be when you hit a healthy enemy,

448
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
you'll Petrify them.

449
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And also this will work against bosses.

450
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So every five seconds that you hit a boss,

451
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
you'll attempt to Petrify,

452
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and then you'll get that bonus damage proc.

453
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So basically this unique now will be giving you

454
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
a damage proc every five seconds against bosses,

455
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
which will be a lot better than now

456
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
where it doesn't really do much to bosses at all.

457
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Next we've got the Necromancer.

458
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So they're getting buffs for all their basic skills.

459
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm showing Decompose here as an example.

460
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
The damage is almost being doubled.

461
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Your essence gain per second is going up by quite a bit.

462
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And also now it'll scale with attack speed bonuses.

463
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So now if you build attack speed or you have it,

464
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Decompose is going to be generating essence for you quicker,

465
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
which it didn't use to before.

466
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
They're also getting some buffs

467
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and kind of some simple functionality changes to some passives.

468
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So an example here with the Evulsion passive is

469
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
before you would get increased crit damage to vulnerable enemies.

470
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And now we're just going to remove that double requirement there

471
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
of focusing on crit and vuln.

472
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So now you'll just get more damage against vulnerable enemies.

473
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So it's just a lot more usable.

474
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's now used, you know, you can use it more generally.

475
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
You don't have to worry about critting all the time to get the bonus.

476
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So it'll just be more consistent.

477
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And then we've got some unique buffs here.

478
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
These are just number buffs.

479
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Some examples, we've got Mordekrux.

480
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So their chance to spawn the Skeletal Simulacrum is going up.

481
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And Howl from below, you're just getting, you know,

482
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
more corpse explosion damage out of it.

483
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So just tuning up these numbers to make them competitive.

484
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Next, we've got the Rogue.

485
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So similar to the Barbarian,

486
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
the Rogue is also getting buffs to the core skills.

487
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Penetrate shot damage is going up.

488
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Flurry damage is going up as some examples.

489
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Also, their key passives are getting a bit better too.

490
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Victimize, the damage scaling is going up

491
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
for your vulnerable damage bonus.

492
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And precision is going up by a pretty hefty amount

493
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
from 15% to 20% of your crit damage bonus.

494
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So it'll just be a lot more potent.

495
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And next, we've got the Sorceress,

496
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
kind of keeping on the theme of buffing key passives.

497
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So this one, we're actually doing a bit of a functionality change.

498
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So Combustion before used to be that, you know,

499
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
you get a big multiplier to your burning damage, 60%.

500
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And then after that, we kind of wanted to reward you

501
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
for putting different burning sources on enemies.

502
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And you would get a little bit of a bonus per source.

503
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Now we're doing away with that second part.

504
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
So you're still getting the burning damage buff

505
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
just across the board.

506
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But now we're actually going to tie it to itemization.

507
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So now you'll just be getting an additional multiplier

508
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
based on your damage to burning enemies bonus.

509
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So now you're going to be looking for that, you know,

510
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
in your gear and your paragon and other places.

511
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So you can now just really buff up the burning damage.

512
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And you don't have to worry about

513
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
putting a bunch of sources on enemies.

514
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Next, a similar vein, Avalanche.

515
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
This key passive is just getting better

516
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
and is going to be tuning into a damage bonus as well.

517
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So before it was that your frost skills have a chance,

518
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
a lucky hit chance to make your next cast

519
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
of a few different skills consume no mana and be stronger.

520
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And when you hit vulnerable enemies,

521
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
it just made the chance better.

522
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And now we're just buffing up the chance baseline

523
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
going from 10% to 30% to get that free cast and bonus damage.

524
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
But now the actual damage that you deal

525
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
is going to be increased by your damage

526
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
against vulnerable enemies stat.

527
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
So now we've added basically a scaling multiplier

528
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
to this key passive.

529
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So it should be doing a lot more damage over time.

530
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Next, we got Aspect of Piercing Cold.

531
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
This is for you Ice Shards enjoyers.

532
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
This one's getting a whole lot better.

533
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So before it used to be that the number of pierces

534
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
was part of the random roll.

535
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And then also the roll made it deal,

536
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
your subsequent hits deal less damage with Ice Shards.

537
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And now we flip the script now.

538
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And now the amount of enemies that's going to pierce

539
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
is going to be static.

540
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So you're just getting more consistent value.

541
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
But instead of doing less damage,

542
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
you're going to deal more damage per enemy hit.

543
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So that actual difference of going from less to more

544
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
is going to amount to a substantial increase

545
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
in the amount of damage that this legendary

546
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
is pumping out for Ice Shards.

547
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's a huge spread.

548
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Last but not least, for the Sorceress,

549
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
we introduced a couple of new legendary aspects

550
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
in Vessel of Hatred.

551
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
We've got them there scaling with Charge Bolts and Incinerate.

552
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And both of these aspects were dealing

553
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
what we call flat damage,

554
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
or it was like a certain damage amount.

555
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And it didn't really scale up as you scaled the skill up.

556
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And we've changed that for both of these.

557
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So the Aspect of Charge Flash

558
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and the Aspect of Overheating

559
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
will now both scale.

560
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
As you get more Charge Bolt or more Incinerate damage,

561
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
these ones will be dealing a lot more damage as well.

562
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So these ones will just scale with you

563
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
and be a lot better over time as you get stronger.

564
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And next, last but not least, we got the Spirit Borm.

565
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So we did do some changes here.

566
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
We really mostly did small buffs to skills

567
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
that haven't really been being used or seen less success.

568
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So we got Razor Wings here.

569
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
The damage is going up a bit.

570
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And also Razor Wings used to have

571
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
actually a set cooldown between casts.

572
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And now we removed that cooldown.

573
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So now you can actually cast Razor Wings faster

574
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
as you build attack speed,

575
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
like all other skills in the game.

576
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
We also did some small buffs to Withering Fist.

577
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
The poison damage went up.

578
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
The slow went up.

579
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And one of the upgrades will now spread to more targets

580
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
when you use it.

581
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And then we also got some buffs to Toxic Skin,

582
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
which isn't really seen much play by players.

583
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
We basically just did some small buffs to its damage,

584
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
both baseline,

585
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
the enhancement,

586
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and one of the upgrades,

587
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,000
the variants of it.

588
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And these are mostly just

589
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
on the skills that people aren't actually using right now.

590
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Correct.

591
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
The archivalism to make the Spirit Borm even stronger.

592
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
No, this is tuning within the builds of a buff.

593
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
We're most definitely seeing Chad

594
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and they're like,

595
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
wait, Spirit Borm buffs?

596
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And these are skills that really no one is using,

597
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
so we want to make sure that...

598
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I mean, I can just buff Quill Volley.

599
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
There you go, Quill Volley.

600
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Most definitely needs buffs, apparently.

601
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
No, but it's for things

602
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
that we just haven't seen a lot of play

603
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
within Spirit Borm players.

604
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I know a lot of players

605
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
are looking at some of the numbers

606
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and they're also...

607
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
These are just like baseline numbers

608
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
on some of these skills.

609
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Obviously, there's a lot of interactions

610
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
that happen beyond that

611
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
from tempering to the gear that you have

612
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and everything like that

613
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
that will end up obviously enhancing those even more.

614
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
So we're expecting to...

615
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
As Adam mentioned before,

616
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
we're not expecting to see

617
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
the other classes jump up

618
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
to the same power as the Spirit Borm

619
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
because the Spirit Borm, again,

620
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
is using some unintended interactions right now,

621
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
but those will be addressed in Season 7.

622
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So with these classes specifically,

623
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
they will get some additional buffs

624
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
so that they can stay competitive amongst each other.

625
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
They're staying together as a pack

626
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
but being a little bit stronger here

627
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,000
with the Mid-Season.

628
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Yeah, the idea with Mid-Season,

629
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
this is probably going to be true

630
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
with most Mid-Season updates,

631
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
is that we're trying to move everything

632
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
a little closer together

633
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
and also to set up for the next season

634
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
where there will be a lot more upheaval.

635
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah.

636
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So we're like prepping everything

637
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
to be kind of close.

638
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Ha, ha, ha.

639
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Upheaval.

640
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Oh, yeah.

641
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I was like, ha, ha, ha.

642
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
But you know, we're getting ready

643
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
for Season 7.

644
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Is that a hint?

645
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Is that an Easter egg?

646
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Cool.

647
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Awesome.

648
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Well, I know we have a...

649
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Again, Adam had mentioned

650
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
that this is just a very small...

651
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah, it's a lot more than just that.

652
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
There's a lot more than just what we showed here.

653
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
That would be the shortest patch notes ever.

654
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But we do actually have a patch notes

655
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
coming out later this week

656
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
that will have all the different class changes

657
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
and everything with the Mid-Season update.

658
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
We do have a few other things

659
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
that are actually also hitting

660
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
related to Rune Words

661
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
and a thing that a lot of people

662
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
have been talking about,

663
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
which is Shrines specifically.

664
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Yes.

665
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So we can Shrines.

666
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
What's wrong with Shrines?

667
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
What's wrong with Shrines?

668
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
What's wrong with the Conduit Shrine

669
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
that I don't purposely ignore?

670
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yeah.

671
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
You mean the real Cursed Shrine?

672
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,000
There you go.

673
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,000
All right.

674
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Jumping into Rune Words first.

675
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
We are doing some tuning changes to Rune Words.

676
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I will tease a little bit

677
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
that we do have some more impactful changes

678
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
coming in Season 7,

679
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
so tune in next week for them.

680
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
But in the meantime,

681
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
we did do some Rune Word buffs

682
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
to ones that aren't being used as much,

683
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
mostly by lowering offering costs.

684
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Some examples here.

685
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
We got the Moni Rune Word.

686
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
The offering that you get

687
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
is increased from 25 to 35.

688
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The Ahu Rune Word.

689
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
The offering is being increased a lot

690
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
from 10 to 25

691
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
when hitting injured enemies.

692
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And then I'm just going to butcher it.

693
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I don't know how to say it,

694
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
but the Seh Rune Word.

695
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
The Wolf Spirits are now always going to be unhindered.

696
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So we often run into issues

697
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
where companions and things like that

698
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
have trouble getting to enemies,

699
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
but since they're spirits,

700
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
so why would other things get in the way?

701
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
So now they'll always be moving through enemies

702
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
and getting to their targets a lot quicker.

703
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And then Shrines,

704
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
you know,

705
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,000
heard some feedback

706
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that they don't really scale too well.

707
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
So the Artillery,

708
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Blast Wave,

709
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
and Conduit Shrines

710
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
will now deal more damage

711
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and they're going to scale with you

712
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
based on your level

713
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
and your Paragon level.

714
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So as you level up,

715
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
as you get stronger,

716
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
the Shrines will be getting

717
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
more potent with you.

718
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
We're going to kind of test it.

719
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You know,

720
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
let us know how it goes,

721
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
see if you actually enjoy getting them

722
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and want to get them now.

723
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
We do see some room maybe

724
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
to do some more things

725
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
and buff them further if needed,

726
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
but we're going to be trying this

727
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,000
as a first step

728
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
to see how it goes.

729
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yeah, I know.

730
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
We've heard from a lot of people

731
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,000
about like,

732
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
especially as you get to later levels

733
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
and you're towards like Endgame

734
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
and Torment 4

735
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
and a Conduit Shrine appears

736
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and it's like,

737
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,000
don't touch it

738
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
because maybe that will make things slower,

739
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
which it currently typically does

740
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
for a lot of players,

741
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
especially Spirit-born players.

742
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So it's cool to see updates

743
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
to these Shrines

744
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
and again,

745
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
feedback is really important

746
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
for us to know like,

747
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
hey, did we hit the mark?

748
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Do we need to do additional things

749
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
or do we need to tweak anything?

750
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So let us know

751
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
after you guys get a chance

752
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
to check out

753
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
the new adjustments to the Shrine.

754
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
So that'll be really important for us.

755
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Some other things

756
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
that are coming down the line,

757
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
we do have some

758
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
in-game specific events

759
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
and items

760
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
that we'll be hitting here

761
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
in the coming weeks?

762
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Weeks?

763
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's a little bit

764
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
after mid-season update.

765
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
We do actually have another,

766
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,000
we're bringing back

767
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
the Red Cloak Horror,

768
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
which is part of the

769
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Midwinter Blight event

770
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
that we had last year.

771
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And we'll actually have

772
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
a blog that details

773
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
all the benefits

774
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
and rewards out of this.

775
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
It's like XP benefits,

776
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000
of course,

777
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,000
that do come

778
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
with this specifically,

779
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,000
which is really great

780
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
to have on top of

781
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
another event that's coming,

782
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
which is Mother's Blessing.

783
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And Mother's Blessing

784
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,000
will also be,

785
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
we'll have that in the blog.

786
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
That blog is going to be

787
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
hitting on Thursday,

788
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I believe.

789
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So keep an eye out.

790
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
For Eternal players,

791
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
we also have

792
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
a cool little thing,

793
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
kind of like a welcome back

794
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
booster type of event

795
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
for them,

796
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
or maybe it's not an event.

797
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I don't know how to coin it,

798
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,000
but Colin,

799
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
what does that entail?

800
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah, so we wanted

801
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
to put together

802
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,000
just something

803
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
to get you back

804
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
into the action.

805
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I know part of X1

806
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
ended up sort of marking

807
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
a bunch of items as legacy,

808
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,000
so we just wanted

809
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
to give everyone

810
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
a one-time booster

811
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
to come back.

812
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
We're going to level you to 50.

813
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
We'll give you a build

814
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
that we've made.

815
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
We've made three different

816
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
ones per class.

817
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You'll be able to use it.

818
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I'm sure everyone watching

819
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
probably doesn't care,

820
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
but we have,

821
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
you will care about this

822
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,000
if you haven't done this,

823
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
is we're going to unlock

824
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
all the altars

825
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,000
of Lilith

826
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
as part of that boost,

827
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
so if you log in

828
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
and just use it

829
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
and you haven't got

830
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,000
all your altars,

831
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,000
get your altars for free.

832
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Just get it for free.

833
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Easy peasy nuts.

834
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah, and if you're

835
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
a base game,

836
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Diablo 4 owner,

837
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
you'll end up getting,

838
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I believe,

839
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,000
one of those boosts,

840
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
and then if you're

841
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
a vessel of hatred,

842
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,000
you'll end up getting

843
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
two of those boosts

844
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,000
on eternal characters,

845
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,000
which is kind of cool.

846
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So if you want to

847
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
jump back in

848
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
or anything,

849
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
especially after

850
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
the changes with,

851
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
there goes my earpiece.

852
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I've been fumbling

853
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
with it all day

854
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
and now it's gone.

855
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
But I know

856
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
a lot of players,

857
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
specifically with Season 6

858
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
jumping back in,

859
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,000
they notice,

860
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,000
as you mentioned,

861
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
a lot of the gear

862
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
went to legacy gear,

863
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
so this kind of gives them

864
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
a way of being able

865
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
to kind of recover

866
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,000
some of that.

867
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yeah, refreshes it.

868
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Exactly.

869
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And then I believe

870
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
we also have

871
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
another free trial

872
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
coming up for any

873
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
new players

874
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,000
that want to check out

875
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
the Spirit Born.

876
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
The Spirit Born

877
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
will actually be part

878
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
of the free trial

879
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
and that will be

880
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
coming up here

881
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
in the coming weeks.

882
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And so all this

883
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
will be in a blog

884
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
on Thursday,

885
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
which is really cool.

886
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And then, of course,

887
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,000
as we mentioned

888
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
at the start of the show,

889
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
we have another stream

890
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000
next week.

891
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
We'll actually have

892
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
a date for the stream

893
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
later this week

894
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
for players

895
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
so that you guys

896
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
can keep an eye

897
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
out for that.

898
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
But that is our

899
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Patch 2.1 PTR stream

900
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and that one

901
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
will be pretty beefy.

902
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
We have a lot

903
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,000
to talk about

904
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
regarding Patch 2.1

905
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,000
and, of course,

906
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
everything that's going

907
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
to be coming

908
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
with Season 7.

909
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
We are super stoked

910
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,000
for that.

911
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
The stream, again,

912
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
will be a little early

913
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
because of the

914
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Thanksgiving holiday,

915
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
so a little bit earlier

916
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
than when PTR

917
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,000
is going to start.

918
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
We do plan on having

919
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
those notes available

920
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
for players before

921
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
the Thanksgiving holiday.

922
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And then I would

923
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,000
expect that PTR

924
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
to start after

925
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
the Thanksgiving holiday

926
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
so when everyone

927
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
is back in post-holiday

928
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
and is able to monitor

929
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
and see how everything

930
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
is going with PTR

931
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
and taking the feedback.

932
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So we'll have

933
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
a stream next week.

934
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You'll see, of course,

935
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
some of us back

936
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
on stream next week

937
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,000
for that.

938
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And I believe

939
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,000
we'll be joined

940
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
by Mr. Dan Tanguay again

941
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
who will be in Albany

942
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
and chiming in

943
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
on all the stuff

944
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
that's coming with

945
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Season 7

946
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
and Patch 2.1.

947
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So lots of big changes

948
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
coming specifically

949
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,000
with that.

950
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I know we do want

951
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
to jump into

952
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
some Q&A

953
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
really quickly.

954
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So if you guys

955
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,000
have any questions,

956
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
we have chat enabled

957
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
on Twitch,

958
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
so twitch.tv

959
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,000
slash Diablo.

960
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
If you're watching

961
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,000
on other channels

962
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
and stuff like that,

963
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
that's where we do

964
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
take in specific questions.

965
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But feel free

966
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
to drop in any questions.

967
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
We'll try to get through

968
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
as many as we can here.

969
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Again, this is just

970
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
kind of an abbreviated stream

971
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
for the mid-season update

972
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and then we'll be back

973
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
in a week.

974
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Next week, yeah.

975
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I get it.

976
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
We took a little bit

977
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
of a break from streaming

978
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
so it kind of makes sense

979
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
so that we'll be back

980
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
pretty quickly.

981
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
But I know

982
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
our first question

983
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
that we have

984
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
is related to

985
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,000
ancestral items.

986
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
We get a lot

987
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,000
of questions

988
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
about ancestral items.

989
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I've seen a lot

990
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,000
of questions.

991
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Oh, this earpiece

992
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
is driving me nuts.

993
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Question number one.

994
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Adam, fix your earpiece.

995
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
There's a plant right here

996
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
which you guys can't see

997
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
so I'm having to read

998
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,000
the screen.

999
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Any updates

1000
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
to ancestral items?

1001
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Do you guys have any updates

1002
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
or news to share

1003
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
regarding that?

1004
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah, I know

1005
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
we saw a lot of confusion

1006
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
in terms of maxing out

1007
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
a lot of the codex of power.

1008
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
In X1,

1009
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
we actually added

1010
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
roughly what we call

1011
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
ranks, five ranks

1012
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
to a lot of the legendary

1013
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
aspects that were

1014
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
ancestral only.

1015
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And I know that caused

1016
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,000
a lot of confusion.

1017
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So currently how it works

1018
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
is ancestral items

1019
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
have a higher upper bounds

1020
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
on the rank

1021
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
that you can achieve

1022
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,000
for that aspect.

1023
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And we have seen

1024
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
quite a bit of people

1025
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
struggling to max out

1026
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,000
their aspects.

1027
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Generally that was

1028
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
the goal

1029
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
is that we do want

1030
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,000
to grind, right?

1031
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Like we think it's good

1032
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
that you can sort of

1033
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
get an aspect right away

1034
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
but we like that

1035
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
once you have that

1036
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
play style assembled

1037
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
we still want things

1038
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
that you need to work on.

1039
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,000
That being said,

1040
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
we think it's a little bit

1041
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
too aggressive right now

1042
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
so we are going to be

1043
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
making some changes

1044
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
which we will detail

1045
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
next week

1046
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
in terms of

1047
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
how that actually works

1048
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
but just know that

1049
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
currently ancestral items

1050
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
are the sort of

1051
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
where you find

1052
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,000
the max rank

1053
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
of a lot of those aspects

1054
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
but you can still find

1055
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
them on anything else

1056
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
that isn't ancestral

1057
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
the lower version.

1058
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Yeah.

1059
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I know

1060
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
and we'll be

1061
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
talking more

1062
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
about ancestral items

1063
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
next week

1064
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
specifically.

1065
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeah, the drop rates.

1066
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Yeah, a lot of stuff

1067
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,000
regarding that.

1068
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Is there any plans

1069
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
this is

1070
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I'm taking a few questions

1071
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,000
from the forums

1072
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and of course chat

1073
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
because we did post this

1074
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
on the forums beforehand.

1075
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Urza from the forum

1076
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
says can we get

1077
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,000
boss materials

1078
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
to stack

1079
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
like runes

1080
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
or maybe even higher?

1081
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Are there any plans

1082
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,000
for something like that?

1083
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Yeah, we are

1084
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
looking into it.

1085
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,000
There's things

1086
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
on our side

1087
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
in terms of like

1088
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
storage and duping

1089
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
that we're a little bit

1090
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
worried about

1091
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000
but we're looking at

1092
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
making a change

1093
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
sometime in the

1094
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
longer future.

1095
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Question from

1096
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
a couple people

1097
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
like Archangel890

1098
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
and Dragonage

1099
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
says any chances

1100
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
that you guys

1101
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
will potentially

1102
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
change like XP gain

1103
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
maybe the growth

1104
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
to Paragon 300.

1105
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Is there any plans

1106
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
on maybe making adjustments

1107
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
or tuning specifically

1108
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,000
on that end?

1109
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Currently not

1110
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
at the moment.

1111
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I think it's something

1112
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
we're monitoring though

1113
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
in terms of the feedback.

1114
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
We do like that

1115
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
you can get just about

1116
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
everything within the first

1117
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
200 Paragon levels

1118
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and everything from there

1119
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
has a pretty steep

1120
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
diminishing return

1121
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
in terms of power.

1122
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
So what we don't want

1123
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
to say to you all

1124
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
is like you need to grind

1125
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
200 hours to unlock

1126
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
your build and do all

1127
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
the things that are

1128
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,000
sort of play style

1129
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
defining which we define

1130
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,000
as like the sort of

1131
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
glyphs and the

1132
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
legendary nodes.

1133
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
So we've seen actually

1134
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
a lot of positive feedback

1135
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
that like you can get

1136
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
your build online

1137
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
and that you still have

1138
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
something to work towards.

1139
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
The sooner we sort of

1140
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
short circuit that

1141
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Paragon grind the more

1142
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
we sort of get back

1143
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
to that pre-expansion

1144
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
one state where you

1145
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
just don't get anything

1146
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:37,000
from killing monsters

1147
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
because you're Paragon 300

1148
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
in the first two weekends.

1149
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So currently you know

1150
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
we're looking at

1151
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
monitoring it and we're

1152
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
super open to the feedback

1153
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
but so far we've seen

1154
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,000
a good amount of

1155
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
positivity around it.

1156
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I think it's kind of

1157
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,000
in line with what you're

1158
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
talking about with

1159
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
the legendary powers

1160
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,000
right now like those

1161
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
last five ranks

1162
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
are on Ancestral Items

1163
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
only and so our idea

1164
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
is like we want you

1165
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
to get your build online

1166
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and play the way you want

1167
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
within a pretty you know

1168
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
pretty quickly or whatever

1169
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
but then you have

1170
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
something to work towards

1171
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
like incrementally

1172
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
to become stronger and

1173
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,000
stronger and that we're

1174
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
okay with taking a long

1175
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
time.

1176
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Totally.

1177
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
As long as it's not like

1178
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
cutting you off from the

1179
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
build at all.

1180
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah it's about getting

1181
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
you into the fun

1182
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
and like making sure

1183
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,000
that your build is

1184
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
blasting but you have

1185
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
things to sort of use

1186
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
that build to blast for.

1187
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That makes sense.

1188
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah and I think

1189
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
there's like the other

1190
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
thing that people are

1191
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
probably forgetting about

1192
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,000
is like we do have

1193
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
these events coming up

1194
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
and stuff which also

1195
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
benefit XP and

1196
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,000
everything like that

1197
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
which will be a good

1198
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
opportunity for players

1199
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,000
to like be able to

1200
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
you know if they

1201
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
they really want

1202
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
because they're

1203
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
as we've seen

1204
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,000
there are

1205
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
there is a reward

1206
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
for getting to

1207
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Paragon 300 and stuff

1208
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
so it allows players

1209
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
that opportunity

1210
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
to kind of use those

1211
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,000
events to be able to

1212
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
boost that and we have

1213
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
obviously Red Cloak

1214
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Horror stuff coming up

1215
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
here and of course

1216
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
we have Mother's

1217
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Blessing so there's

1218
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
opportunities to help

1219
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
with some of that XP

1220
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
based off of those

1221
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
events specifically.

1222
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
so there is a question

1223
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
regarding like materials

1224
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
again you know can we

1225
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
expect any additional

1226
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
buffs for drop rates

1227
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
on Rawhide, Iron,

1228
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Forgotten Souls

1229
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
anything like that?

1230
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Yeah so actually it is

1231
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
in the midseason but we

1232
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
did buff Legion events

1233
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I know that was a

1234
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
personal favorite of a

1235
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
lot of folks for the

1236
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,000
midseason.

1237
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
For season 7 we're

1238
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
taking a look at just

1239
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
sort of buffing the

1240
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
various sources and

1241
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
also really drilling down

1242
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
on like what are the

1243
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
bottlenecks players are

1244
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
having and iterating

1245
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,000
towards that.

1246
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
There's no major

1247
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
changes coming in season

1248
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
7 like we're not going

1249
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
to quadruple the amount

1250
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
of materials across the

1251
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
game but it is

1252
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
something again in the

1253
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
spirit of like tightening

1254
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
the things that we have

1255
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
we are actively looking

1256
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,000
at a lot of the

1257
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
material inflows and

1258
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
outflows and we want

1259
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
to give you the tools to

1260
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
sort of get the

1261
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
materials that you're

1262
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
looking for.

1263
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Sort of what we're

1264
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
trying to do is ensure

1265
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
that there are things

1266
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
that you still care about

1267
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
right and you still want

1268
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,000
to grind.

1269
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It's still in that spirit

1270
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
of like it's walking

1271
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
that fine line of there

1272
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
things to work towards

1273
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
without it feeling super

1274
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:56,000
tedious.

1275
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,000
So that's what we're

1276
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
trying to tighten and

1277
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
work towards.

1278
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
There is a question

1279
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
regarding this from

1280
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Remster Ma says do you

1281
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
have any plans and start

1282
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
bringing in new midseason

1283
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
mechanics?

1284
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I think for that more so

1285
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I would expect like

1286
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
larger mechanics content

1287
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
changes and stuff like

1288
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
that to happen around new

1289
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
seasons as opposed to a

1290
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
midseason update.

1291
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I think we look at

1292
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
taking midseason updates

1293
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
making tweaks to you

1294
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
know balance items or

1295
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
anything that we're

1296
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
hearing feedback from so

1297
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
that we can spend most of

1298
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
our you know concentration

1299
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and focus on really

1300
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
putting in some of these

1301
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
newer type of content

1302
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
pieces around new season

1303
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,000
specifically.

1304
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah I think you think

1305
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
going forward is midseason

1306
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
is a time to just like

1307
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
tweak and iterate and

1308
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
you know use it rework

1309
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
existing things but we're

1310
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
really putting all of our

1311
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
books on like bigger

1312
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
upheavals you know larger

1313
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
changes lots of new stuff

1314
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
into the beginning of the

1315
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,000
season.

1316
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,000
So next week will be

1317
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
pretty exciting.

1318
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
We got a lot of new stuff

1319
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
coming in but that's where

1320
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,000
we're kind of targeting

1321
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
that to make that kind of a

1322
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
big moment and exciting

1323
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
time to come back and

1324
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
play.

1325
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
There is a question from

1326
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Casual Dragon regarding

1327
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Undercity Drops and

1328
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
asking is there any plans to

1329
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
potentially fix those make

1330
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
those better specifically

1331
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
on that end.

1332
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Yeah so this sort of leads

1333
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
into there are some

1334
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
ancestral drop rate changes

1335
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
that we want to talk about

1336
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
next week but in general

1337
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
what that'll mean is all

1338
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
the loot across the game

1339
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
will generally get better

1340
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
so it is something that

1341
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
we're working on.

1342
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I'm about to take this

1343
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
earpiece and throw it

1344
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
across the room because it

1345
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
just keeps popping out and

1346
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
it's driving me insane.

1347
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
That's a question from

1348
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
PezRadar.

1349
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
The question from

1350
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Finamdar says Diablo

1351
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
at Diablo any stability

1352
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,000
fixes coming?

1353
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Been seeing a whole lot

1354
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
more crashes since the

1355
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,000
last couple patches.

1356
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I will say that we've

1357
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:56,000
been monitoring.

1358
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
We can actually see

1359
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
whenever a player

1360
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
actually crashes.

1361
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
We know it.

1362
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
We get logs from it on

1363
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
our end.

1364
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I know that the

1365
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
engineering team here

1366
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
has been doing a ton of

1367
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
work on working to get

1368
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
the game more stable.

1369
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
You've probably seen a

1370
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
bunch of different

1371
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
small client patches go

1372
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:18,000
out.

1373
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
We actually just re-enabled

1374
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
like DLSS in a client

1375
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
patch that went out

1376
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,000
yesterday.

1377
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
There are additional

1378
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
changes and more

1379
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
reviewing that's being

1380
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
done from our side to

1381
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
ensure that the game is

1382
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
running very stable so

1383
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
expect to see more of

1384
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
that as we get through

1385
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
this season and of

1386
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
course into next season

1387
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
because our goal is to

1388
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
make sure baseline everyone

1389
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
can jump in without any of

1390
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
these types of issues and

1391
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,000
everything.

1392
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Shout out to our

1393
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:43,000
engineering team.

1394
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I know they've been

1395
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
working long and hard on

1396
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
figuring all this stuff

1397
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
out.

1398
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
They've been, that's like

1399
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
their top priority right

1400
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,000
now.

1401
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
They actually behind the

1402
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
scenes we even collaborate

1403
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
with them a lot on doing

1404
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
various things related to

1405
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
game performance under the

1406
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
hood like making skills

1407
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
cleaner, making

1408
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
interactions cleaner.

1409
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
like we're constantly

1410
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
doing stuff to make the

1411
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
game run smoother in the

1412
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
background pretty much

1413
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
every patch like we're

1414
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
fixing multiple things so

1415
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,000
it's definitely something

1416
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
that we're always working

1417
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,000
on actively.

1418
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Why so blue panda bear?

1419
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Any chance on tempering

1420
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
schools can be used more

1421
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,000
than once?

1422
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Investing time to finally

1423
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
get a rare drop and it

1424
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
bricks kind of doesn't feel

1425
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
too great.

1426
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Any thoughts on tempering

1427
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
schools, how that's been

1428
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,000
going?

1429
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Yeah, I think it's

1430
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,000
definitely something we

1431
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
hear a lot of feedback on

1432
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
and it's something that,

1433
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
you know, we were sort of

1434
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
taking an incremental

1435
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,000
approach, right?

1436
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Like with the expansion

1437
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
one changes, we made it

1438
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,000
so that a lot of the

1439
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
recipes are three.

1440
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
We also added, of course,

1441
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
the scroll of tempering or

1442
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
restoration in expansion

1443
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
one to see how that sort

1444
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
of changes things.

1445
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So we're just really taking

1446
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
a measured approach.

1447
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
If we see still there's a

1448
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
lot of feedback that it

1449
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
just still isn't hitting

1450
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
that mark, we're absolutely

1451
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
open to changing things

1452
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
like potentially letting it

1453
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
be used more than once.

1454
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And we're just sort of

1455
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
monitoring at this point.

1456
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
We are getting questions

1457
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
about the Armory.

1458
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Stay tuned.

1459
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
TM.

1460
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Soon.

1461
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,000
TM.

1462
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
We'll have information

1463
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
on that.

1464
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
As you guys know, that

1465
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
has been in development.

1466
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,000
It's something that we've

1467
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
already confirmed about.

1468
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
We'll be talking more

1469
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
about it here soon.

1470
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,000
TM.

1471
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So, keep your eyes peeled?

1472
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Is that the term?

1473
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Keep your eyes peeled?

1474
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I don't know.

1475
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
There's a saying that,

1476
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
you know, stay tuned.

1477
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I don't know.

1478
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Last question here that we

1479
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
have before we head off is

1480
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Holes Transition says,

1481
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
will Dance and Gnize get

1482
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
buffs and any changes to be

1483
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
more compatible with

1484
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
collecting loot, like

1485
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
opening doors, etc.?

1486
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
You know, when you're

1487
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
spinning to win with your

1488
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Gnize and stuff, is there

1489
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
any way or any plans of

1490
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
potentially having them

1491
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
seamlessly move around

1492
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
a dungeon or something

1493
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:58,000
like that from that?

1494
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Nothing on my radar

1495
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
right now, but that's a

1496
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:03,000
good note to take.

1497
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
That's a good note to take.

1498
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It's a good note to take.

1499
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Rogues want to spin to win

1500
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
and never stop.

1501
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
You have to do all this

1502
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
setup and snapshot and

1503
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
then you have to open the

1504
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,000
door.

1505
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
So, we do know it's a thing.

1506
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Yeah.

1507
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
So, we'll see.

1508
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Stay tuned.

1509
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Stay tuned.

1510
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It's another thing to stay

1511
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,000
tuned.

1512
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
So, again, thanks again

1513
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
everyone for jumping in,

1514
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
providing questions and

1515
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
everything from our end.

1516
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
We will have patch notes

1517
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,000
later this week.

1518
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
So, stay tuned for that.

1519
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
The blogs for Mother's

1520
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Blessing, the Red Cloak

1521
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Horror, our Eternal

1522
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Boost stuff, everything

1523
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
will be out on Thursday.

1524
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So, also check out for

1525
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:43,000
that blog.

1526
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Mid-season update hits

1527
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
next week.

1528
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
So, patch notes will be

1529
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
out before the mid-season

1530
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,000
update.

1531
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And you guys will also

1532
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
hear about our stream

1533
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
date next week for the

1534
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Patch 2.1 PTR.

1535
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So, we'll be talking a

1536
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,000
whole bunch.

1537
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
That will be another

1538
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
beefy stream.

1539
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,000
This one I know is a

1540
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
little bit short.

1541
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
There's going to be a

1542
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
little bit more beefy

1543
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
than this one.

1544
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But look at this.

1545
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Two streams in two

1546
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,000
weeks.

1547
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
We're about to do it.

1548
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So, we will see you

1549
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
guys next week.

1550
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Again, huge thanks to

1551
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Colin, Adam, for

1552
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,000
joining us.

1553
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Our wonderful mini

1554
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Cosroy over here.

1555
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Super awesome.

1556
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Super cute.

1557
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Love you, Aaron.

1558
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
But thank you guys.

1559
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:19,000
We'll see you guys next

1560
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
week for our Patch 2.1

1561
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
PTR stream.

1562
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
And, yeah.

1563
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Check out the blogs and

1564
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
patch notes later this

1565
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,000
week.

1566
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
See you guys.

1567
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
cause you來.

1568
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Um, no.

1569
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Cause you're not

1570
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,000
good.

1571
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
See you.

1572
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Ooh.

1573
01:12:52,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Thank you.

1574
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Thank you.
