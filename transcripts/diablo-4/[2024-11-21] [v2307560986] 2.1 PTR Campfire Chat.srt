1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I have to say, it just went way beyond my expectation.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's like nothing that we had in D4.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Pure hatred, their Mephisto's army.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
They wanted them to feel a little bit more different from your typical demon family.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Everyone's quality was top-notch.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But at the time, we didn't know if it was going to work.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think where we landed is going to turn some heads.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is not your normal thing.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's the living form of hatred.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The new monster class that we get to introduce, they're called hollows.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
These hollows have actually been around for like millennia.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Mephisto at some point did go to Nahantu a long, long, long time ago.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And these hollows were a reaction of Mephisto being in Nahantu at the time.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And then they went dormant.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Bringing Mephisto in the Soul Stone seems like the right thing to do for Narell.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But it has a chain reaction that I don't think anybody was prepared for.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The hollows are really rife throughout Nahantu now that Mephisto is back.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And just visually, like horribly disgusting.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And sort of made up of the things that have been consumed by the hollows.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, they're an extension of evil.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Infecting wildlife and other monsters and people with this thing called ichor.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And they're just sort of going mad.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,000
When we're designing the hollows, the main thing that we wanted to push was just if hatred came to life, what would it look like?

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So we're thinking this black goo that's kind of like formless, but also have this red anger energy inside of it.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then with concept, we just want to make, you know, cool monsters.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What if it's three legs?

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What if it's no legs?

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What if it has like three arms?

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So we pushed a lot of like options and exploration.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then from then on, like everyone from narrative to design and concept would talk about it.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's like, okay, we like this one.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And then we can push it and move it further.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The hollow family is made up of four members.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The swarmer, the spitter, the caster, and the brutes.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A big thing for me was that the family need to be overwhelming without just relying on pure numbers.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So they're going to get stronger over time if you let them fester their hatred after all.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The swarmer can teleport and attack you from behind, from the sides.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The spitter is a slug with legs.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They spew out this vomit stream of who the brute is.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The big, hulking, slow guy of the family.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He has the shield that's buffing and making the rest of the army stronger.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The caster is responsible for creating new swarmers.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They also will channel onto a specific hollow and view them with extra hatred.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It makes them stronger and more deadly.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The hollow caster's role serve as an elegant, hovering, yet menacing dungeon character in a game.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It really informs many of our design ideas.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
When we want to make a new variant, we want to know in which specific area we are going to see that character or creature.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Readability is like the main focus.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We went through several iterations on the design, the texture, the materials and the camera testing.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The day after she gave in, what was it, 10 different variations?

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I was like, okay, now we are talking.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The emission on the spikes really did an awesome job to both on the CineVet and also to improve the readability.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And in the end, we have the version that we were both happy with and handed it over to the tech artists.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We had some really strong narrative direction in understanding how big of a role hatred played.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And we knew that we needed one look to tie it all together.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This hatred has one source and it's all about Mephisto.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
For the hollow specifically, we identified that we wanted to do some special work with the materials, with the shaders for those characters.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Shaders are the code that runs on the GPU that takes in all sorts of inputs like textures and lighting and position and outputs what the object's surface is supposed to look like.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We wanted a shader that was capable of adding this sludge layer, this hatred layer over top of it and making it dynamic and animating so that it really looks like it was constantly undulating or writhing.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So once we had this shader function, we were able to apply that in all these different contexts, like the monsters, like the environment, the character armors even.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Most of the shader work was done by Alex, who really took that shader function and made it work in all sorts of different contexts.

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And we also have the hatred add-ons to these characters, these tentacles, these writhing hatred growths all over them, which was a procedurally generated process that was largely run by Skye on our team.

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The Hollow's boss was kind of born of this idea of what does a pinnacle hollows really look like.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We have the hollows family, and that was pretty well defined by the time that the hollows boss kind of came up for concepting.

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Our artist, Victor, had a lot of cool ideas for horror themes and really wanted to push visuals with contortions and like breaking the neck of this monster all over the place.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's where we had the option to go, like, and we'd push it and really get that idea of what hatred and the hollows are all about.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This inky black ichor that latched on to a once powerful spellcaster.

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It was such a great source of power that this particular hollows monster turned into the priestess of hatred.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm Victor Lee, a principal concept artist on the Diablo team, and I concepted the Priestess of Hatred.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Victor Lee is one of the OGs from Diablo, and he's known for creating a lot of dark imagery.

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And every time we want to have a monster or boss, he's done all the greats, even Diablo himself.

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
One of his monitors on the side of his desk is just like a dark black eye staring at him.

73
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And so when we needed something that's pure darkness, like, we had to tap Vic.

74
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I feel like when we're talking about hatred, I kind of imagine, visualize it as like a black, webby-like thing.

75
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So I thought a spider configuration would work for this.

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So I did a few variations, some with souls, human souls trapped in their abdomen.

77
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's like a purgatory because this creature consumes humans.

78
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I had this nagging feeling for a long time that why I felt it's not working, no matter how interesting the design is,

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not pushing the boundaries.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So I basically rethought the whole thing.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
A lot of our creatures are just like raw aggression.

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's just muscly and just brutal.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Maybe this one is more insidious.

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What if the human figure is not controlling the hatred, but it's the other way around?

85
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Like the hatred is actually mocking humanity.

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's like dragging a puppet around.

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So what I did is I kept the human figure as a focal point, but the rest of the creature is this moving mass of basically a ball of hatred.

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It broke a lot of rules, but I felt, I just felt like this just fits.

89
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So I went ahead with it and rendered it out.

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I was looking at the concept for the first time with the designer on the feature, Charles,

91
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and we were kind of in this stunned silence for a little bit because it was this reaction of,

92
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
this thing is so cool.

93
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And then we started thinking, how are we even going to make this thing move?

94
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Typically, our monsters are bipedal or they're quadrupeds.

95
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
How's it going to move?

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We can't rely on walk cycles anymore.

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
How's it going to rotate?

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We can't rely on, you know, the built-in rotation stuff without looking weird as hell.

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It was clear that in order to make this like animate and look natural,

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
we were going to have to pretty much dive into uncharted territory.

101
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We wanted it to move in a very unique way.

102
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We wanted it to somersault through the air and be super unpredictable and zippy

103
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and just have like ridiculous animations as those tentacles are flying all over the place.

104
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We have that narrative and kind of drive to make it formless.

105
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And with our conventional rigging that we can do that.

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We were doing prototyping before the feature even kicked off.

107
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like we were already meeting with animation and tech art to say,

108
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
hey, we have this thing.

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We think it's really cool, but we need help figuring this out.

110
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So we had a lot of early collaboration, which was really what set us up for success.

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When the animator came back with it, going from post to post rather than your normal animations,

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I was like, yes, that's it.

113
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's what hatred should feel like.

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
When you first find the Priestess of Patriot, it's going to look like a lifeless human corpse.

115
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And you're like, this doesn't look like a boss fight.

116
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm in a boss arena.

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What's going on?

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But as you approach, you see that the body gets pulled into a giant pool of Patriot.

119
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And then out of that pool of Patriot comes this giant mass of tentacles.

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And that is the boss.

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So after animation, it gets to come to me.

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And I get to do all of the really cool visual effects at the end.

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Show what those tentacles are doing when they impact the ground.

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
When they slap something.

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
When they hit the player.

126
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It really brings the entire thing together.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The vomit attack is really gross.

128
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Because there's like this part of the torso of the humanoid that has been kind of hollowed out and now has teeth.

129
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The tentacles come out from the mass and they grab the humanoid and kind of pull the body back.

130
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So that the slit in the belly opens up and all of the hatred just pours out a straight beam.

131
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's pretty gross.

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The Hollows are just such a unique family.

133
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
From the moment they spawn in on your screen, you can tell that they are different.

134
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They have just such unique behaviors and animations.

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We were able to execute on a vision that's really just so different than what we typically do.

136
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The whole process made me feel very proud of our whole team.

137
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Everyone just got it.

138
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
They understood what the monster was.

139
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
They got the vision.

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And it just worked.

141
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The eye on the screen has many functions.

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It keeps me in the right frame of mind.

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What we are doing is dark.

144
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It should be horrifying.

145
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I should feel the fear while I'm doing it.

146
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a reminder of that.

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The eye also serves as a warning.

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Like, get moving.

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't dwell too long and wander around, you know.

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Get this thing moving.

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Get the work done.

152
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hello, Diablo community.

153
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Welcome to another Diablo 4 Campfire chat.

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We ended with a creepy eyeball.

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We were just talking about it.

156
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
out. This one is our

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Patch 2.1 PTR

158
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Campfire Chat. I know we were

159
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
just here last week when we were talking about the midseason

160
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
update, but this one is kind of like the big

161
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
one because we're going to be talking about everything coming

162
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
at Patch 2.1 and Season 7.

163
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I am joined here by Mr. Colin

164
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Feiner, Mr. Charles Dunn,

165
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
who have appeared on prior Campfire

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Chats. We were going to have Adam Jackson.

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He is unfortunately not

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
feeling very well, so we hope he gets better

169
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
soon. And we do also have

170
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
another guest here who is

171
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
live from Albany, Blizzard Albany, and that

172
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
is Mr. Dan Tanguay, who's

173
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
going to be talking a little bit

174
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
as well about what's coming up

175
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
for Patch 2.1.

176
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He's showing off his red

177
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Diablo 4 jacket. We have our new

178
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
black Diablo 4 jackets as well.

179
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Look at this. Models.

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
How are you, Dan? Hopefully you're good.

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And he's not sure if he

182
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
can hear me.

183
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But either way.

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Either way.

185
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
A few things that we do want to

186
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
talk about before we actually do

187
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
jump into everything.

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Obviously, PTR is coming up soon.

189
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We are doing this stream a little

190
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
early this time, mainly

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
because the Thanksgiving

192
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
holiday is coming up here in the U.S.

193
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And so we are going to be talking

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
about some of the contents before

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
even the patch notes are ready.

196
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We do plan on having a blog

197
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
immediately after this stream,

198
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
so players can actually check out the blog

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and read a little bit more about what we

200
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
talked about today.

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But the patch notes will be available

202
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
next Wednesday for players

203
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
to actually check out.

204
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So it will be before the U.S.

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
holiday here, so everyone can

206
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
kind of dive deep into the patch notes

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
for PTR.

208
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
PTR is currently planned to start

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
on December 3rd.

210
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So that will be after the U.S.

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
holidays here for Thanksgiving.

212
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So there's a ton of stuff that

213
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is coming up for players

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,000
to kind of jump into.

215
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But I know what we want to do

216
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
is really just dive straight deep

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
into all the new stuff

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that we do want to talk about.

219
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So for the first thing

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
we do want to chat about

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
is just Season 7

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and what that's going to be.

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So we're actually going to jump over

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
to Mr. Dan Tanguay

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
in Albany

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to kind of walk us through.

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So Dan, do you want to

228
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
take over?

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh no.

230
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Dan can't currently hear.

231
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
All right.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So I don't know what happened.

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I mean, you know,

234
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
maybe we don't have

235
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
satellites working

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
or something like that.

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So instead,

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I guess we'll just start

239
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
with classes first.

240
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Sure.

241
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So Mr. Charles Dunn,

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
do you want to talk about

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
class changes that are coming

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
with Season 7?

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I know we talked a little bit

246
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
about this last week

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,000
with Adam Jackson.

248
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Just a reminder,

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Spirit Born,

250
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
expect that to be

251
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
addressed for Season 7

252
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and we will actually be

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,000
talking a little bit

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
about that now.

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So Charles,

256
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
take us through it.

257
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, absolutely.

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'd love to talk about

259
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
some of the changes

260
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
coming to all the

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
different classes

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
in Diablo 4

263
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
as well as some broader,

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
more systemic updates

265
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that are happening

266
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that kind of affect

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
all classes equally

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
in a way.

269
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, so like I said,

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
just going through

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
individual class by class

272
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and seeing some of the

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
new stuff that's coming

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
for a lot of the

275
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
classes.

276
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's start with

277
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
the Barbarian,

278
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I believe,

279
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,000
the first one up.

280
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yeah, so Barbarian

281
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
is definitely a class

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
that we think

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
a lot of the classes

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
have been performing

285
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
pretty well across the board.

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They're always a step

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
under the Spirit Born,

288
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
but Barbarian

289
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
maybe a step and a half

290
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
below and so we're

291
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
looking at a lot of buffs

292
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
across the board

293
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
for them here,

294
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
specifically looking at

295
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
some stuff with

296
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Hammer of the Ancients,

297
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
buffing that number up here.

298
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
A little bit of a rework

299
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
to the Walking Arsenal

300
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,000
passive.

301
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Previously,

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
it was,

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
the bonus was just 8%.

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Now we're going to be

305
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
giving you a bigger bonus

306
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and when you have

307
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,000
all of them active,

308
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
you're going to get

309
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
more attack speed

310
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and some bonus

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
crowd control duration

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,000
which we think

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
really plays into

314
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
that kind of build.

315
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Additionally,

316
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
we're also updating

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Earthquakes

318
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
that has been

319
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
one of my favorite

320
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
builds on Barbarian,

321
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,000
right?

322
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Just seeing those

323
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
big earthquakes

324
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000
come out everywhere.

325
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Leafquake is the best.

326
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Leafquake,

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I absolutely love it.

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The visuals on that

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
is just top notch.

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So we're really,

331
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
we took some lessons

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
from what we did

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
on Rogues in the past

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,000
with their

335
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
stun grenades power

336
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
where a lot of the

337
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
legendaries that talked

338
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
to stun grenades

339
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
also had kind of

340
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
this extra bit

341
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
where it increased

342
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
the damage of all

343
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
of your stun grenades

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
so that you kind of

345
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
got these synergistic

346
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
builds with the

347
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
various aspects

348
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,000
all together

349
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and we're extending

350
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,000
that over to

351
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Earthquakes now here.

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So we're adding on

353
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,000
basically,

354
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,000
hey,

355
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
all these ones that

356
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,000
talk to Earthquakes

357
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,000
just,

358
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
they increase the

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
damage of all of them

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
overall.

361
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah,

362
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
it's a little bit

363
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,000
less finicky too,

364
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
right?

365
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because now it lasts

366
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
after the Earthquake

367
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,000
expires or if you

368
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
leave it.

369
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Absolutely.

370
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So we think this

371
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
would just be a much

372
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
more comprehensive

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
build overall.

374
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We've also got

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
a new legendary

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
that talks directly

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,000
to Earthquakes as

378
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
well,

379
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,000
ups their damage

380
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and increases

381
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
their fire,

382
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
turns it into

383
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
fire damage.

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And I think this

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,000
is really cool

386
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and we're going to

387
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,000
see some more

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
stuff as you actually

389
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
get onto the PTR

390
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,000
but I think

391
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Earthquakes and

392
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Hammer of the

393
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Ancients might be

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
a build that

395
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
you're going to be

396
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
very interested in

397
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
combining those two

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,000
with some of the

399
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
stuff that you

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,000
will see

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
come PTR.

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Alright,

403
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
let's move on to

404
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
the Sorceress.

405
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Sorceress,

406
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
one of the key

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
notes that we've

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
noticed with

409
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Sorceress over

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
the whole lifespan

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
of Diablo 4

412
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
is that

413
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
players often felt

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,000
like they were

415
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
pigeonholed into

416
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
burning builds

417
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
in particular.

418
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Firebolt enchantment

419
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
is probably

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
the most used

421
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
enchantment by far

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
enemies.

423
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Because it was just

424
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
kind of a free

425
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
way to apply a

426
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,000
very small amount

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
of burning to

428
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,000
enemies.

429
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But that was what

430
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
you needed to turn

431
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,000
on a lot of the

432
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
passives in their

433
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
skill tree.

434
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And that was a

435
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
powerful build,

436
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
powerful interactions

437
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
but we felt like

438
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
that was making

439
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
everything a little

440
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,000
too homogenous.

441
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You felt like you

442
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
had to do this

443
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
in order to access

444
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
a lot of these

445
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,000
passives.

446
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And so we decided

447
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that we really want

448
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
these burning

449
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
synergies to really

450
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
be benefiting builds

451
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
that are dedicated

452
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
to burning type

453
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
builds.

454
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And not just ones

455
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,000
who are splashing

456
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
it in with

457
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Firebolt enchantment.

458
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And so with that

459
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
in mind we did a

460
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
rework on the

461
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
enchantment to

462
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
increase the

463
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
or remove the

464
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
burning damage

465
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,000
from the enchantment

466
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and change it

467
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,000
over to this

468
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
which has a

469
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
healing component

470
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,000
to it.

471
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And then we also

472
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
updated a lot of

473
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
those burning

474
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
passives to really

475
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
play better in the

476
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
dedicated fire based

477
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
builds rather than

478
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
being something that

479
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,000
you just want to

480
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
splash into everything.

481
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, hopefully

482
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
there's a lot more

483
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
build variety.

484
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Absolutely.

485
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, that is one

486
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
of the main

487
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
driving goals

488
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,000
of a lot of our

489
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
updates is increasing

490
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
that build variety

491
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
so you don't feel

492
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,000
like you have to

493
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
take this checklist

494
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
of mandatory things

495
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,000
before moving on

496
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
to what you actually

497
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
want for your build.

498
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So an example here

499
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
on Devouring Blaze

500
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
you've got a bonus

501
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
previously it was

502
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
bonus critical strike

503
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
damage against burning

504
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
enemies no matter

505
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,000
how much they're

506
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
burning for.

507
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So you just apply

508
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that little bit of

509
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
burning and you

510
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
would get this.

511
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Now instead you get

512
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
a bigger bonus but

513
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
it's just for your

514
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
pyromancy critical

515
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,000
strike skills.

516
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So it really encourages

517
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
hey you're a fireball

518
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,000
build, you're a meteor

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
build, something that

520
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
wants to do those

521
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
big fire crits.

522
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Devouring Blaze is now

523
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,000
even more valuable

524
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
for those builds

525
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and it's not something

526
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
that you necessarily

527
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
need to or feel

528
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
compelled to splash

529
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
in other builds.

530
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Alright, on to the

531
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,000
next one.

532
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We also did some

533
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
updates for Ball

534
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Lightning.

535
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So Ball Lightning

536
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
the previous upgrades

537
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
like kind of these

538
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
mages Ball Lightning

539
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and wizards Ball

540
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Lightning were about

541
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
stunning enemies

542
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
or spawning some

543
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,000
crackling energy

544
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
with admittedly

545
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
some kind of

546
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
complex conditions

547
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,000
you had to jump

548
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
through a lot of

549
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,000
hoops to get these.

550
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
One of the things

551
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
we really like to do

552
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,000
with a lot of these

553
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
updates is simplify

554
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
them down and

555
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,000
streamline and really

556
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
focus in on what

557
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
the interesting

558
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
factor is.

559
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah, it makes it

560
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
a little bit more

561
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,000
modular too, right?

562
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So there's more

563
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
builds the less

564
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
sort of focus that

565
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
initial step is on

566
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,000
that skill.

567
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Absolutely.

568
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So we've got the

569
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Mage's Ball Lightning

570
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
here that now is

571
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
just increasing its

572
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
damage against stun

573
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,000
enemies.

574
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's really that

575
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
payoff for a lot of

576
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the lightning stun

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
effects and then

578
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wizards Ball Lightning

579
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,000
is just always going

580
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
to be generating

581
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
more crack energy,

582
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
just more consistent

583
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,000
generation there.

584
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
All right, on to

585
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
the next one.

586
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We've got some

587
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
of the new uniques

588
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,000
that we want to

589
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
show off here on

590
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
the sort, talking

591
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
about Ball Lightning.

592
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So this is actually

593
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
something interesting

594
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
we're doing this

595
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
season where we're

596
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
making two uniques

597
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
that are in the

598
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
same slot and

599
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
they're going to

600
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
modify the skill in

601
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,000
a different way.

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So they will be

603
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
mutually exclusive.

604
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So you can take

605
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
either this one here

606
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
which turns Ball

607
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Lightning into a

608
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,000
kind of like a

609
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
bowling ball, really.

610
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You send it forward,

611
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
it goes pretty fast,

612
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and when it hits a

613
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
target it's going to

614
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
explode and kind of

615
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
splash outward.

616
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And I think this is

617
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
really cool.

618
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It offers a switched

619
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
up play style to the

620
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
way you're familiar

621
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
with Ball Lightning

622
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,000
which is kind of

623
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
slow moving forward

624
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
or if you pick the

625
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
other unique, you can

626
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
actually retain the

627
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
old gravitational aspect.

628
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So we can go on

629
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and take a look at

630
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
that one here in

631
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
the next clip.

632
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Right, so a lot of

633
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
the Ball Lightning

634
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
builds in the past

635
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,000
were using the

636
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
gravitational aspect

637
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that caused it to

638
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
rotate around you

639
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and we've updated

640
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
that and kind of

641
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
reworked the

642
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,000
gravitational aspect

643
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
so that now that

644
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
functionality is built

645
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,000
into this new

646
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
unique and also has

647
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,000
some additional

648
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
bonuses to encourage

649
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
this kind of play

650
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,000
style.

651
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and obviously the

652
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
gravitational aspect

653
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,000
that used to do

654
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
this has been

655
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
reworked into a new

656
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,000
cool effect that

657
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
you'll be able to

658
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
demo out on the

659
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
PTR as well.

660
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This is like a fun

661
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
trade-off now on sort

662
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
of how you want to

663
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,000
use Ball Lightning.

664
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah, it really helps

665
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,000
it be a bit more

666
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
build defining which

667
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
is our goal for a lot

668
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
of the uniques is

669
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
hey, you get this

670
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
unique and it feels

671
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
like it's very

672
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
foundational to your

673
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,000
build.

674
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
One thing I do want

675
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
to call out here is

676
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the inherent affix on

677
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
this right up near the

678
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
top that Ball Lightning

679
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
can be cast while

680
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,000
moving.

681
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This makes it a lot

682
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
smoother to just be

683
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
moving around and

684
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
just keep on clicking

685
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,000
that Ball Lightning

686
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and you're not going

687
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
to have to stop like

688
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
that very short

689
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
half-second stop to

690
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,000
cast it.

691
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It just feels much

692
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
smoother and this is

693
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
one that you really

694
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
this build just wants

695
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,000
to be on the move

696
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and that encourages

697
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,000
that.

698
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
All right, so let's

699
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
talk about the Druid

700
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,000
next.

701
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
So this one, Druid

702
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
is this season a lot

703
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
of Werewolf updates.

704
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You know, Season of

705
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
the Werewolf.

706
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I absolutely love

707
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Werewolf builds and

708
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think they've been,

709
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
you know, maybe a

710
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
little bit behind the

711
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
rest of builds over

712
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the course of Diablo's

713
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
history and so this

714
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
season a lot of our

715
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
updates are really

716
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,000
focused on building,

717
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
making that build come

718
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
up to par.

719
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah, like pure

720
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Werewolf, right?

721
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Pure Werewolf.

722
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Not mixing it with

723
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
other things.

724
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, a lot of times

725
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
you saw some like rapid

726
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
shape-shifting builds

727
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and those are fun,

728
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
those are great, but

729
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
you know, pure Werewolf

730
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
was really, wasn't quite

731
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
hitting the mark and so

732
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,000
that's what a lot of

733
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
our focus is.

734
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Let's take a look at

735
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
some of these updates.

736
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So we've got updates to

737
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Shred, you know, the

738
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
main core skill for

739
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
these Werewolf builds.

740
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Previously, the Raging

741
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Shred upgrade was just

742
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,000
a combo attack that

743
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
applied some poisoning

744
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
damage.

745
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So now it's going to

746
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
still do that and apply

747
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
a lot more poisoning

748
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
damage, but it's also

749
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
going to cause them to

750
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
take even more poisoning

751
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
damage for the next

752
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,000
five seconds.

753
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So this is, you know,

754
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
your kind of finishing

755
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
move on your combo or

756
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
your core combo, but

757
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
then it also enhances all

758
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
of the other poisoning

759
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,000
damage that you've applied

760
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
through something like

761
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
rapies.

762
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,000
All right.

763
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We've got updates to

764
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Boulder.

765
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Now this isn't necessarily

766
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
with the Werewolf theme,

767
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
but still Boulder is a

768
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
skill that we saw a good

769
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
opportunity to improve on

770
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,000
it.

771
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We had two upgrades on

772
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Boulder in the past,

773
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
the kind of the two

774
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
choices, and they were

775
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
both fairly similar.

776
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They both dealt with

777
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
critical strike chance or

778
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
critical strike damage,

779
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and we thought that was

780
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
an opportunity to rework one

781
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
of them to give it a

782
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,000
different identity.

783
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And basically the

784
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
identity was Poison

785
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Boulder, like just a

786
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
giant ball of poison.

787
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
What does that look like

788
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
or what does that do?

789
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Changing the damage type

790
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
always helps sort of

791
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
branch out and make it

792
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,000
feel really different.

793
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah.

794
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah.

795
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And we have some really

796
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
sweet visuals for it

797
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,000
too.

798
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm not sure if we have a

799
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
video on that.

800
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I think we'll just have to

801
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
rely on that in the PTR.

802
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah.

803
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
People will see it on the

804
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
PTR, but yeah, it's got

805
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
some cool visuals

806
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
associated with it.

807
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah.

808
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And so that one will be

809
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,000
very cool.

810
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Definitely check that one

811
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,000
out.

812
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This one I'm very excited

813
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
about because Blood

814
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Howl, as we see, has

815
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,000
always just generated

816
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
spirit, but now...

817
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah.

818
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah.

819
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It was always just

820
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
generated some spirit,

821
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
but you still do that,

822
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
but now it gives you even

823
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
more increased damage

824
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
until you shapeshift out

825
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
of werewolf form.

826
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So going back to what

827
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Colin had mentioned

828
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
about really focusing in

829
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
on pure werewolf.

830
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That was an area that

831
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
we felt, hey, we want

832
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
to really reward you

833
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
for staying in the

834
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
werewolf form and really

835
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
committing to that

836
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
identity and just making

837
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
sure that felt like an

838
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
appropriate payoff, and

839
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
this is one of the areas

840
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
that we're doing that in.

841
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,000
All right.

842
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So let's talk a little

843
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
bit about one of the

844
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
updated legendaries.

845
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So the aspect of the

846
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Blurred Beast.

847
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So this previously was a

848
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
legendary that just

849
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
caused your shred to do

850
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
some bonus damage to

851
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,000
poison enemies.

852
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It was fine, but it

853
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
wasn't too enticing.

854
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But now with the new

855
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
update here, you actually

856
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
still do more damage

857
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,000
just all the time.

858
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And depending on how

859
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
far you're traveling for

860
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
shred, you're going to

861
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
do some bonus hits.

862
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And it looks so cool.

863
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Your werewolf is dashing

864
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
across the screen and

865
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
then just doing this

866
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
multi-hit kind of attack.

867
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And so if you're really

868
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
close, you're just going

869
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
to get maybe one

870
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,000
additional strike.

871
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But if you're at this

872
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
further distance, as you

873
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
see in this clip, you're

874
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
going to get the full

875
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
four hits.

876
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So it's really about

877
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
positional gameplay a bit

878
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
more than it was in the

879
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,000
past.

880
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And you get very heavily

881
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
rewarded for it when you

882
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
do kind of execute that

883
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,000
properly.

884
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,000
That's awesome.

885
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And it's going to be

886
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,000
really great for like

887
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
movement, just moving

888
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
around across the map,

889
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
which I know movement is

890
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
always a big thing that

891
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
players really, really

892
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,000
want.

893
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
People have always been

894
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
asking for.

895
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So it'll be cool to see

896
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,000
people just kind of like

897
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
just bouncing around as a

898
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
druid with the aspect of

899
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
the Blurred Beast.

900
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So very cool.

901
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah.

902
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's always great where

903
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
we can inject like changing

904
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
how you play also, right?

905
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Because you can imagine

906
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
like launching into a

907
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
group of enemies, then

908
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
picking out specific

909
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
targets that you really

910
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
want to launch to.

911
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And that's how you

912
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
optimize that build

913
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
combat wise.

914
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Absolutely.

915
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
This is one of my

916
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
favorite ones in this

917
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,000
patch, actually.

918
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Big fan of a lot of

919
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
these druid updates.

920
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Aspect of Wolf's

921
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Reign.

922
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So this is a combo kind

923
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
of legendary combining

924
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
the powers of Hurricane

925
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
and your wolf

926
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
companions.

927
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So when you cast

928
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Hurricane, all of your

929
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
wolves actually spawn a

930
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
little mini Hurricane of

931
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
their own.

932
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And these will do bonus

933
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
damage for each of your

934
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Act of the Wolves.

935
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So it really encourages

936
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
these companion based

937
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
builds that already have

938
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
this wolf pack of, you

939
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
know, five wolves

940
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,000
following them around.

941
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Now your Hurricane

942
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
affects all of them.

943
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And, you know, they get

944
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
bonus damage for how

945
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
many you got.

946
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So you really want to be

947
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,000
stacking up as many

948
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
wolves as you can.

949
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
They all get Hurricanes

950
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and you just get to

951
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
shred through the whole

952
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
screen with that.

953
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That's super cool.

954
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
All right.

955
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Moving on to Rogue.

956
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So this is one that

957
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Shadow Clone has been

958
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
probably the Rogue skill

959
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
that I would say

960
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
maybe wasn't quite

961
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,000
hitting the mark

962
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
compared to most

963
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,000
other skills.

964
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And that was for a

965
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
variety of reasons.

966
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
And not to get too

967
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
technical here on the

968
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
details, but for a lot

969
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
of the effects that

970
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
you have with your

971
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
legendaries and your

972
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
passives and those

973
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
kind of things,

974
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
historically Shadow Clone

975
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
behaved inconsistently

976
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,000
with those.

977
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It wouldn't necessarily

978
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
pick up all of the

979
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,000
bonuses.

980
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It wouldn't trigger all

981
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,000
of the effects.

982
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And the end result was

983
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,000
basically that your

984
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Shadow Clone dealt a

985
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
whole lot less damage

986
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
than you did.

987
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You thought, hey, I'm

988
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000
hitting for, you know,

989
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
millions and my Shadow

990
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Clone's hitting for,

991
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
like, thousands.

992
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Right?

993
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah.

994
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And so we really

995
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
looked at that

996
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
comprehensively and

997
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
thought, okay, we need

998
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
to kind of rethink how

999
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Shadow Clone works

1000
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
across the board to

1001
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
really bring it up to

1002
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
par to make it behave

1003
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
the way you expect.

1004
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And then also extend

1005
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
that to a lot of the

1006
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
other summons in the

1007
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
game.

1008
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The summons like your

1009
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Necromancer skeletons,

1010
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
your Druid companions,

1011
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and so on.

1012
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So we did basically a

1013
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
rework of that entire

1014
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
system.

1015
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And the long and short

1016
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
of it is that they

1017
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
should just work a

1018
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
whole lot better going

1019
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
forward in this season

1020
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
where they're going to

1021
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
trigger all of your

1022
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
lucky hit effects.

1023
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
They're going to

1024
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
interact with all of

1025
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,000
your damage modifiers

1026
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and multipliers that

1027
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
they previously were

1028
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
inconsistently working

1029
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,000
with.

1030
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So just one example

1031
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
here, a very simple

1032
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
example.

1033
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You've got Wind

1034
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Strikers aspect.

1035
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
This is a very simple

1036
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
legendary that just

1037
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
says, hey, when you

1038
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
critically strike,

1039
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
gain some movement

1040
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,000
speed.

1041
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Now, in the past,

1042
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
that was only when you,

1043
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
your player character,

1044
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
critically striked

1045
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,000
with one of your

1046
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
skills.

1047
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And it would not

1048
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
happen whenever one

1049
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
of your Druid companions

1050
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
or your Shadow Clone

1051
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
critically strikes.

1052
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But now, all of that

1053
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
will work.

1054
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So your companions or

1055
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,000
your summons or your

1056
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Shadow Clone critically

1057
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
strikes and you have

1058
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Wind Strikers, now your

1059
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
character gets that

1060
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
bonus.

1061
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's huge.

1062
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah, I really can't

1063
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
overstate this, like how

1064
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
many new interactions and

1065
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,000
synergies this unlocks

1066
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
with not just Shadow

1067
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Clone but all of the

1068
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,000
summons in general

1069
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
across the game.

1070
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But with Shadow Clone in

1071
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
particular, we've got a

1072
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
new unique item and this

1073
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
one is Assassin's Stride.

1074
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And the effect here works

1075
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
with mobility skills and

1076
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
your Shadow Imbuement.

1077
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Once again, kind of playing

1078
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
up that combo aspect.

1079
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
So all of your mobility

1080
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
skills are going to always

1081
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
be Shadow Imbued with some

1082
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
bonus potency.

1083
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So they're going to do some

1084
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
more damage.

1085
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,000
damage.

1086
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And whenever you damage an

1087
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
elite or boss with a

1088
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
mobility skill, there's a

1089
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
chance to trigger an instant

1090
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
free Shadow Imbuement

1091
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Explosion.

1092
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So those of you who like

1093
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
playing Shadow Step builds,

1094
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
one of my favorite ones with

1095
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Rogue, you know, just like

1096
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Adam had said before about

1097
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
jumping around the screen

1098
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
with werewolves, you can do

1099
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
that with Shadow Step now

1100
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,000
too.

1101
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And you're just going to be

1102
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
getting a lot of those

1103
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
resets and kills much

1104
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
quicker as you leap out of

1105
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the shadows, trigger a Shadow

1106
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Imbuement Explosion, and then

1107
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
move on to the next pack.

1108
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
of enemies.

1109
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Really cool, unique for

1110
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
that kind of build.

1111
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Additionally, Caltrops may be

1112
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
the skill that was the most

1113
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
kind of clunky on control

1114
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
wise to use.

1115
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Thank you.

1116
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
God, seriously.

1117
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
If you've ever tried to use

1118
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Caltrops, it can be a

1119
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
struggle sometimes where your

1120
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
character would leap backwards

1121
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
and you wouldn't go in the

1122
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
right direction, wouldn't hit

1123
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the enemies.

1124
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
We've updated the animation

1125
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
here to just basically be a

1126
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
lot, very similar to the

1127
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Smoke Grenade skill where you

1128
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
just pick a point on the

1129
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
screen, your character throws

1130
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
it, and it just goes where

1131
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
you point it.

1132
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I am the king of like

1133
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Caltropping one minion out of

1134
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
like a hundred and then also

1135
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
falling, like jumping back

1136
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
into like a giant mob and

1137
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
going like, well, I didn't

1138
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
calculate that correctly.

1139
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So this, that update, I've, we

1140
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
were talking about this

1141
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
beforehand, like before we even

1142
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
went live and I was like,

1143
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
thank, thank the effing God.

1144
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I was like, oh my God, please.

1145
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So yeah, it's, I'm excited for

1146
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,000
that.

1147
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Caltrop should be so much more

1148
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
usable now and we think that

1149
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
this is a really good change

1150
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
going forward.

1151
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah.

1152
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
All right, on to the Necromancer.

1153
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So Necromancer, we've done some

1154
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
improved itemization and updates

1155
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to the overpower synergies,

1156
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
specifically the Rathma's Vigor

1157
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
key passive.

1158
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So previously it would just give

1159
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
you some, an overpower once

1160
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
every 12 seconds and, or when

1161
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
you overhealed for some bonus

1162
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
life and now we're just tacking

1163
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
on a big chunk of overpower

1164
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
damage to it.

1165
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
We definitely felt like these,

1166
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
these pure blood based overpower

1167
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
builds were just not quite

1168
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
hitting that mark and, you know,

1169
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
just pumping the power into

1170
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
these pure builds through the

1171
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Rathma's Vigor key passive,

1172
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
we think is going to be very

1173
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
helpful to make these builds

1174
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
really shine.

1175
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
On to the next, we've got the,

1176
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
one of the new uniques.

1177
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So similar to what we did with

1178
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
the Sorcerer where we had kind

1179
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
of these paired uniques, we're

1180
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
going to have two uniques in the

1181
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
same slot for Necromancer as well,

1182
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
this time in the pants slot.

1183
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And they're both going to be

1184
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
working with Bloodwave.

1185
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So this one, Kissimmee's Legacy,

1186
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
will cause, instead of shooting

1187
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
one Bloodwave out forward, you're

1188
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
going to get two that kind of

1189
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
converge on you.

1190
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And this definitely changes up

1191
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
the targeting of it, the

1192
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
positioning requirements, and

1193
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
really the use case because it's

1194
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
pulling towards you instead of

1195
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
pushing away.

1196
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So instead of being a defensive

1197
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
skill, it's much more about the

1198
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
damage and pulling them together.

1199
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And then when they hit, they do a

1200
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
big chunk of damage as well.

1201
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So definitely turns Bloodwave

1202
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
into a much more damage focused

1203
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
skill and a little bit less on

1204
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
the CC or the knockback,

1205
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
crowd control of it.

1206
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah, and it plays super well

1207
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
with that key passive.

1208
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Absolutely.

1209
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Absolutely.

1210
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Especially if you want to be

1211
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
using this for that big damage

1212
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
moment.

1213
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Now the alternative is Indria's

1214
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Memory, where it still shoots

1215
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
the Bloodwave forward, and then

1216
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
at the end of its path, it will

1217
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
trap the targets in a bone prison.

1218
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So this is a unique that is very

1219
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
much about combining blood and

1220
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
bone.

1221
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So a little bit less of the pure

1222
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
blood and much more about

1223
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,000
combining the two.

1224
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Now additionally, you see we're

1225
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
using some bone spears here, or

1226
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
should I say blood spears, because

1227
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
that is what they now become.

1228
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Fancy.

1229
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Blood spears, and instead of

1230
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
costing a bunch of essence, they're

1231
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
going to cost, or sorry, they

1232
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
drain maximum life, still cost

1233
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
essence there, but they drain

1234
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
maximum life to cast additionally

1235
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
from a nearby corpse to fire an

1236
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
extra bone spear slash blood

1237
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,000
spear.

1238
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So there's a lot going on with

1239
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
this one, but I think it really

1240
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
comes together to be a very

1241
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
strong build when you're using

1242
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
the bone spear and the blood

1243
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
wave, and then casting bone

1244
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
spear reduces blood waves.

1245
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Cooldown, that's the inherent

1246
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
affix on these legs, really makes

1247
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
a really cool build that I think

1248
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
synergizes very nicely.

1249
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah, it's awesome.

1250
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
All right, and so on to the

1251
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
spirit born.

1252
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So we kind of warned at the start,

1253
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
you know, spirit born we recognize

1254
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
has been one or multiple steps

1255
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
above most other classes, and

1256
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
players have fun.

1257
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
People love playing the spirit

1258
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
born, very powerful, and we

1259
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
really like that, but we do have

1260
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
to recognize, you know, for the

1261
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
long-term health of the game, it's

1262
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
important that we have a bit

1263
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
better class parity across the

1264
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
board, so you don't feel like

1265
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
you're doing it wrong if you're not

1266
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
playing a spirit born.

1267
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Yeah, and we have like a lot of

1268
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
the classes outside of the spirit

1269
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
born are actually in a really good

1270
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,000
spot.

1271
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
They're pushing pit tier 100 plus,

1272
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
which is great, and again, we're

1273
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
not looking to really buff every

1274
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
class up to clearing pit 150

1275
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
easily, right?

1276
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
We don't want to create that arms

1277
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
race where we just have to

1278
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
continuously sort of ask you, the

1279
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
player, to chew through, you know,

1280
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
20 different torment tiers because

1281
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
we're just arms racing that power

1282
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
so much.

1283
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah, we do think that kind of our

1284
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
target there is closer to where the

1285
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
other five classes are, and spirit

1286
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
born was just, you know, too high

1287
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,000
up.

1288
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And it's rather than try to power

1289
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
creep the whole game, we'd like to

1290
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
make sure we make some small

1291
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
improvements everywhere else to the

1292
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
underperforming builds and those

1293
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
ones that don't have enough love,

1294
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
and then get spirit born back down

1295
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
to a more healthy spot.

1296
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And so with that in mind, one of the

1297
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
biggest offenders, or biggest power

1298
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
points, rather, on the spirit born

1299
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
was the Rod of Kapoleki here.

1300
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
This one is the one that converts

1301
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
your core skills into basic skills,

1302
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and does, it used to do reduced

1303
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
damage based on vigor cost, and

1304
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
admittedly, the calculations there

1305
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
were kind of complex, and so we've

1306
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
simplified it down a little bit

1307
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
where they will just gain the bonus

1308
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
critical strike damage.

1309
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It will be substantially less.

1310
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Previously it was 1 to 3%, now it'll

1311
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
be down to 0.1 to 0.5 per point

1312
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
of vigor there.

1313
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
We think this will bring it to a much

1314
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
healthier spot, but still kind of

1315
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
retain the core fantasy and the core

1316
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
build implications of this item.

1317
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It just won't be pushing quite the

1318
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
same trillions of damage that we were

1319
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
seeing before.

1320
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
We also fixed some of the issues

1321
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
called out here at the above, like

1322
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Viscous Shield and things like that,

1323
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
scaling in unintended ways that were

1324
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
just way outside of our expectations.

1325
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, definitely some unintended, kind of

1326
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
bugged interactions that were maybe

1327
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
double dipping or scaling too high.

1328
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We've taken a pass to make those more

1329
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
in line with our expectations.

1330
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
All right.

1331
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Additionally, we've got new aspects.

1332
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Of course, being a class NBL before,

1333
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
you're going to be getting new content

1334
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
every season.

1335
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So we've got a new legendary aspect

1336
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
here, the aspect of endless talents

1337
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
that causes your razor wings to

1338
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
increase all of your eagle skill damage,

1339
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and razor wing critical strikes will

1340
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
grant even more stacks.

1341
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
So you can really stack that up.

1342
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You know, it stacks up to 50%.

1343
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's a whole lot.

1344
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
So you really want to be spamming out

1345
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
these razor wings and getting those

1346
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
crits to stack this up as fast as

1347
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
possible.

1348
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah, and this goes back to like just

1349
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
the prior slide where we talked about

1350
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
how razor wings and centipede builds

1351
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
are getting some extra love in this

1352
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
specific season, which were more so

1353
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
underutilized in season six.

1354
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So with season seven players,

1355
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
we'll see these new legendary aspects,

1356
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
of course, and then and how they

1357
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
actually tie back in with some of the

1358
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
changes that we're doing for those

1359
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,000
builds.

1360
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Absolutely.

1361
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
All right.

1362
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
We've got some updates to some of the

1363
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
underused uniques as well.

1364
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Ring of Writhing Moon here.

1365
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
This one would trigger Pestilence

1366
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Swarm every 10 seconds.

1367
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
We felt like that was a little too long

1368
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
given the pace of combat in our game

1369
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
and especially compared to some of the

1370
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
other options at the unique slot,

1371
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
ring slot.

1372
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So we've reduced that down to every four

1373
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,000
seconds.

1374
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You'll spawn a Pestilence Swarm and the

1375
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Vigor generated goes up from one up to

1376
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,000
three.

1377
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So a lot more resource generation because

1378
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
your rings are often resource generated

1379
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
ones.

1380
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So we want to make sure this is a

1381
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
compelling option compared to your other

1382
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
choices at the ring slot.

1383
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
All right.

1384
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So let's talk a little bit about some of

1385
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
the broader updates that affects all

1386
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,000
classes.

1387
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So the one I'm excited about here is the

1388
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
ultimate updates.

1389
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
So in the previous season we introduced

1390
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
skill ranks on ultimates, right?

1391
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So you can now rank up your ultimate up

1392
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
to rank five and that was good.

1393
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Gave you some cooldown reduction, some

1394
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
damage.

1395
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But now when you actually fully invest in

1396
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
it up to that rank five, every ultimate

1397
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
in the game is going to get a new rank

1398
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
five bonus.

1399
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So for example here on Lacerate, we've got

1400
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
at rank five Lacerate's damage is going

1401
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
to be increased by 40% of your critical

1402
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
strike damage bonus.

1403
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It gives it this scaling factor.

1404
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So you can see on the left Lacerate at

1405
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
rank one is doing about 38,000 damage, but

1406
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
you rank it up to five and it goes crazy

1407
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
high up to 119,000 damage because it's

1408
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
now getting that critical strike damage

1409
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
scalar.

1410
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And so if you really want to build a

1411
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
dedicated Lacerate build as kind of your

1412
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
core damaging effect, this is going to be

1413
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
a great way to build around it and a good

1414
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
reward for investing all those extra skill

1415
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,000
points into it.

1416
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Definitely.

1417
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I love to see us add more things that

1418
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
incentivize you to actually put some points

1419
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,000
into skills.

1420
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah.

1421
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So often, you know, sometimes you'd see

1422
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
if you just wanted the access to the

1423
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
utility of the ultimate, hey, it's fine

1424
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
to put in one point, right?

1425
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You get one point, you get the utility,

1426
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
maybe you get some buff from it.

1427
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But if you really want to invest in it,

1428
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
we want to make sure that that investment

1429
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
in those skill ranks feels meaningful.

1430
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And we think these rank five bonuses on

1431
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
ultimates in particular is going to be a

1432
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
really good way to pay off those ultimate

1433
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
builds.

1434
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Definitely.

1435
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,000
All right.

1436
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
We've also got some new generic legendary

1437
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
aspects to really support this style that

1438
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
talk directly to ultimate skills.

1439
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So we've got the vehement brawlers aspect

1440
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
that causes casting an ultimate skill

1441
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
increases all of your damage output by 10 to 30%

1442
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
for eight seconds.

1443
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And you also gain additional skill ranks

1444
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
in your ultimate.

1445
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So, hey, we just talked about skill rank bonuses.

1446
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Now we've got, you know, a legendary that will

1447
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
give you some bonus skill ranks.

1448
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Nice.

1449
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We've also got the Ring of Apoject Fervor,

1450
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
which says casting your ultimate skill will

1451
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
increase your damage by 8 to 18%, so a little

1452
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
bit less than the vehement brawlers.

1453
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
But it stacks up to 10 times.

1454
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So you can get way more if you can cast your

1455
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
ultimate fast enough and kind of chain it

1456
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,000
together.

1457
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So this will be really good for, like,

1458
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
rogues that use preparation to really get

1459
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
that ultimate cooldown reduction or any build

1460
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
that really wants to focus around casting

1461
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
your alt many times in a row.

1462
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
This one is going to be a great legendary

1463
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
for those style of builds.

1464
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
All right.

1465
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
We've also done some updates to the Rune Words.

1466
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And so Rune Words, Vessel of Hatred feature,

1467
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
you know, has been really well received.

1468
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
We think that they've really, you know,

1469
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
spiced up some build variety.

1470
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And we're going to add some new runes here

1471
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and update some of the old ones.

1472
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So all of the invocation runes have overflow.

1473
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So the cost of many of them have also been

1474
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
adjusted to allow you to proc this overflow effect

1475
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
when you generate more offering than needed

1476
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
much more often.

1477
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And then also the ritual runes,

1478
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
the ones that, you know, generate the offering,

1479
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
some of them have been redesigned to have

1480
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
some larger potential moments of this overflow.

1481
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So an example here on the Seer Rune,

1482
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
this generates a ton of offering,

1483
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
300 offering at once.

1484
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And you get that by casting five skills.

1485
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But then instead of just casting five skills

1486
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and then generate all of it

1487
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and then casting five again instantly,

1488
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
we've added in this exhausted period for three seconds.

1489
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So you can get that 300 offering at once,

1490
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
but then you've got to wait three seconds

1491
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
before you start building up those stacks again.

1492
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah.

1493
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It's like getting, like, large buckets

1494
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
every, like, couple seconds and stuff of offering now.

1495
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Yeah.

1496
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This is a good tuning knob to kind of make sure that,

1497
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
hey, we can give you the strong moment of power,

1498
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
but then it is followed by a little bit of a weaker moment

1499
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
where you can't generate that.

1500
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Rather than every Rune always just being a steady amount,

1501
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
we like to have those peaks and valleys.

1502
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I really think that leads to more interesting moments

1503
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,000
of the gameplay.

1504
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah.

1505
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's about potency versus frequency.

1506
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Right.

1507
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So you get really strong effects,

1508
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
but you can't do it as often.

1509
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Right.

1510
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And that'll play right into the updates

1511
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
with a lot of the overflow

1512
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
to make sure that when you do overflow,

1513
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
it feels really good

1514
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and feels really rewarding to get that.

1515
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
So let's talk about some of the other Runes.

1516
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
We've got some new Runes to show off.

1517
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yeah.

1518
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So we've got three new Rune words here.

1519
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,000
The Nagu Rune,

1520
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
a legendary Rune that will gain 100 offering

1521
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
as long as you're maintaining a summon.

1522
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And so as I kind of alluded to earlier

1523
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
with the Shadow Clone section,

1524
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
summon is our new catch-all term

1525
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
for anything that you summon.

1526
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You know, it's pretty self-explanatory,

1527
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
but that includes things like Necromancer minions,

1528
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Druid companions,

1529
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Sorcerer Conjurations,

1530
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Rogue Shadow Clones,

1531
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
and even Barbarian Ancients

1532
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
from some of your effects.

1533
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Call of the Ancients

1534
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and some of the Legendaries that summon those.

1535
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Those are all summons.

1536
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Igni Rune will generate 25 offering,

1537
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,000
but it stores up offering every 0.3 seconds.

1538
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So you're actually doing about 75 offering per second,

1539
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,000
roughly.

1540
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And you actually cash it in

1541
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
by casting a non-basic skill

1542
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
to get that offering.

1543
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So as long as you're out there

1544
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
kind of spamming your basic skill,

1545
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
you're going to be kind of banking up this offering.

1546
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And then when you cast that non-basic,

1547
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
you cash it all in,

1548
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
you probably trigger the Rune it's connected to,

1549
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
you get a big overflow,

1550
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
you get a big moment of power there.

1551
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And finally,

1552
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
we've got the Chalk Rune

1553
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
that generates,

1554
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
or requires 20 offering rather,

1555
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and this will invoke Druid's Lightning Bolt.

1556
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,000
That's one of those,

1557
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
it's not the core skill,

1558
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
but Lightning Bolt is kind of that

1559
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
other power in the Druid's kit,

1560
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
similar to like Earthquake or Stun Rage.

1561
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yeah.

1562
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So enable those kind of builds

1563
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
to really tap into that effect.

1564
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Awesome.

1565
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Lots of Rune updates.

1566
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Yeah.

1567
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Lots of Rune updates.

1568
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Lots of changes coming to classes.

1569
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You know,

1570
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
there's more changes in the notes

1571
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
that we'll have

1572
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
that we'll be hitting next week.

1573
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So players can look into those.

1574
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
These are just a few examples

1575
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
that we have for PTR.

1576
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And of course,

1577
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
really need feedback

1578
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
on a lot of these changes.

1579
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I know there's some people going in chat

1580
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,000
going like,

1581
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,000
hey,

1582
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm noticing like,

1583
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,000
you know,

1584
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
maybe you're giving a lot of offering

1585
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and then there's a little bit

1586
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
of a cool down period

1587
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
or something like that.

1588
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Let us know.

1589
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Like we want people to try those out.

1590
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Yeah.

1591
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Like test it out

1592
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
so that we have the feedback

1593
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
so that before we go live

1594
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
with patch 2.1,

1595
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
we can end up

1596
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
making any feedback changes

1597
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
based off of community feedback.

1598
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So lots of cool stuff.

1599
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Thank you so much

1600
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
for walking us through

1601
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
all the different class changes

1602
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
and everything like that, Charles.

1603
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Do we have Dan

1604
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
available from Albany?

1605
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
We do have Dan.

1606
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I can hear you now.

1607
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Oh, there we go.

1608
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I was like,

1609
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Dan was just like staring blankly

1610
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
at the camera

1611
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and I was like,

1612
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
yes, I was.

1613
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
But Dan is actually

1614
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
going to be talking about

1615
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,000
all the new content

1616
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
that's coming in patch 2.1

1617
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
with season seven.

1618
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So Dan,

1619
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,000
do you want to take it away

1620
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and talk to us

1621
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
a little bit about it?

1622
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Absolutely.

1623
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
A couple of technical difficulties

1624
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
could not keep me

1625
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
from sharing this

1626
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,000
with everybody.

1627
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So this PTR

1628
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
for patch 2.1

1629
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
is a PTR

1630
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
of a couple firsts

1631
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
at this point.

1632
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
This is going to be

1633
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the first time

1634
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,000
that we're bringing

1635
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
the seasonal realm

1636
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
to a PTR.

1637
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So what does this mean?

1638
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
We've got a lot

1639
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
of seasonal content

1640
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
coming up in season seven

1641
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
and we want to be able

1642
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
to get all of your feedback

1643
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
on this content.

1644
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's pretty important

1645
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
for us to,

1646
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,000
you know,

1647
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
like Adam was saying,

1648
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
really have those

1649
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
iteration cycles

1650
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
where y'all are able

1651
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
to test and,

1652
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
you know,

1653
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
show what's working

1654
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and what isn't.

1655
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
This is also

1656
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
going to be

1657
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,000
the first time

1658
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
since season two

1659
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that we're bringing back

1660
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
seasonal character powers.

1661
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So if you remember

1662
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
in season two,

1663
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
season of blood,

1664
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
they were vampire powers

1665
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and you slotted them

1666
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
into your sanguine circle.

1667
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And so for season seven,

1668
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
it could be a little bit different.

1669
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Not vampires this time.

1670
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
This time it's going

1671
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
to be witchcraft.

1672
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And so I'm excited

1673
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
to really dig into that

1674
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
right now

1675
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
and tease out

1676
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
what y'all can play

1677
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
in a couple weeks.

1678
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So witchcraft

1679
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
enables you

1680
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
as a practitioner

1681
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
to call upon

1682
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
the power of the swamp

1683
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
to do your bidding.

1684
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And so you've met

1685
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
some witches before

1686
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
in the game

1687
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
and you're going to meet

1688
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,000
some more

1689
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
in the coming season.

1690
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But before I really

1691
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
dive into witchcraft,

1692
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
we got to talk

1693
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
about your enemies.

1694
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Now your enemies

1695
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
of this season

1696
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,000
are going to be called

1697
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
the head rotten.

1698
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Now the head rotten

1699
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
are abominations

1700
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
that spawned

1701
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
from the tree of whispers.

1702
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And you're going

1703
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
to slay them

1704
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and collect

1705
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
what we call

1706
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
restless rot.

1707
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And this is going

1708
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
to be our currency

1709
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
for the season.

1710
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Now, like I said,

1711
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
you know,

1712
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
the season is about witchcraft.

1713
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So there are going

1714
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
to be some witches.

1715
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And those witches

1716
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
are going to be

1717
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,000
residing around

1718
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
the tree of whispers.

1719
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And they're going

1720
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
to have some altars.

1721
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And these altars

1722
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
are pretty important

1723
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
to you learning

1724
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,000
your witchcraft.

1725
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And so you're going

1726
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
to travel to an altar.

1727
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You're going to make

1728
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
an offering

1729
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
of restless rot.

1730
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And that's going

1731
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
to enable you

1732
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
to learn the witchcraft.

1733
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Now,

1734
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
equipping witchcraft

1735
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
is going to be

1736
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
pretty simple.

1737
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You know,

1738
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
we wanted to

1739
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
take what was best

1740
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
from a lot

1741
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
of these styles

1742
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
of menus

1743
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
that we've done

1744
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,000
in the past

1745
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and distill it

1746
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
into something

1747
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
that's very convenient

1748
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
and easy to use.

1749
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And the result

1750
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
is this witchcraft menu

1751
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,000
that you can see

1752
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
in front of you.

1753
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And so equipping

1754
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
is going to be

1755
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
super simple.

1756
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You've got an inventory

1757
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
on the bottom

1758
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
and then you're going

1759
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
to drag or otherwise

1760
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
move that power

1761
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
to one of the slots

1762
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,000
up top.

1763
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And you're going

1764
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
to have five normal slots,

1765
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
five normal powers

1766
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,000
you can equip

1767
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
at any point

1768
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and one unique power

1769
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,000
for, you know,

1770
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
really special witchcraft

1771
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,000
that you can find.

1772
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The other thing

1773
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
is that you can upgrade

1774
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
your witchcraft

1775
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
directly in that inventory.

1776
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
using Restless Rot.

1777
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So again,

1778
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
we're streamlining

1779
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,000
the process

1780
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
to, you know,

1781
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
make it easy

1782
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,000
for players

1783
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
to equip

1784
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and upgrade

1785
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
their witchcraft.

1786
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Now,

1787
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
obviously,

1788
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,000
it wouldn't be a season

1789
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
without some rewards.

1790
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And so let's talk

1791
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
about those a little bit.

1792
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,000
This season,

1793
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
we're going to have

1794
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
another reputation

1795
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
style gameplay

1796
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,000
in the form

1797
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
of Coven's Favor.

1798
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Now,

1799
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
killing Head Rot

1800
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,000
will get you

1801
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Headless Rot

1802
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
or killing

1803
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Head Rot

1804
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and will get you

1805
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Restless Rot.

1806
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
But in order

1807
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to advance

1808
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
the Coven's Favor,

1809
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
you actually need

1810
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
to complete Whispers.

1811
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And completing

1812
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,000
those Whispers

1813
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
will increase

1814
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
your rank

1815
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and allow you

1816
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
to unlock rewards,

1817
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
including items

1818
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and materials

1819
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and things like that.

1820
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
In addition,

1821
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
new to this season,

1822
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
you're going

1823
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
to also unlock

1824
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
at certain ranks

1825
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
new witchcraft.

1826
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And then you will

1827
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
have new things

1828
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,000
you can learn

1829
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
from those altars.

1830
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
and then,

1831
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
because everyone

1832
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,000
loves it,

1833
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
we're bringing

1834
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
back the Resplendent

1835
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Spark as well.

1836
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So that's going

1837
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
to be at the end

1838
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
of your

1839
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Coven's Favor rank.

1840
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And of course,

1841
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
the Resplendent

1842
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Spark nowadays

1843
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
can be used

1844
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
from crafting,

1845
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,000
you know,

1846
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
a random mythic

1847
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
unique to actually

1848
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
targeting uniques

1849
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,000
using a lot

1850
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
of those runes

1851
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
that you can earn

1852
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,000
in the game.

1853
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
All right.

1854
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
One last little thing

1855
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
with respect

1856
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
to witchcraft.

1857
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So we wanted

1858
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,000
to try out

1859
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
something a little

1860
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,000
bit different.

1861
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And so we've

1862
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
also created

1863
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
several powers

1864
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
that are lost

1865
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
to these witches,

1866
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
the Coven of the Swamp.

1867
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And so those

1868
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
you can only find

1869
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,000
by traveling

1870
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
out in the world

1871
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
and discovering

1872
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
forgotten altars.

1873
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And these forgotten

1874
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
altars will allow

1875
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
you to learn

1876
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
these lost powers.

1877
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And yeah,

1878
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
we just thought

1879
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
we'd try something

1880
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,000
a little bit different

1881
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
here.

1882
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And yeah,

1883
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
let us know

1884
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,000
what you think

1885
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
about it.

1886
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Now,

1887
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
let's talk about

1888
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
some of the witchcraft

1889
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
itself.

1890
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You know,

1891
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
we've talked it up

1892
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
a bit.

1893
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
We're going to

1894
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,000
release,

1895
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
it's over 20 powers

1896
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
for the season.

1897
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And we're going

1898
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,000
to show you

1899
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
four of those

1900
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,000
right now.

1901
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So let's talk

1902
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
about the first one.

1903
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
This one's really

1904
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
popular.

1905
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
This is the Poison Frog.

1906
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So the Poison Frog,

1907
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
as you imagine,

1908
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
is a servant

1909
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,000
that you can summon

1910
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
that fights

1911
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,000
alongside you.

1912
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
as its name

1913
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
implies,

1914
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
it will poison

1915
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,000
your enemies.

1916
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And, you know,

1917
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
if it runs out of

1918
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,000
health,

1919
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
it's going to

1920
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
explode viciously

1921
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
with a lot of

1922
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
poison damage.

1923
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Folks are having

1924
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
a lot of fun

1925
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,000
with this one.

1926
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Next up.

1927
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Next up is

1928
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Doom Orb.

1929
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Doom Orb is a pure

1930
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
orb of eldritch energy

1931
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
that circles around

1932
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
you and damages

1933
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
any enemy it touches.

1934
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And it can also

1935
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
launch itself at

1936
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
distant enemies

1937
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
before returning.

1938
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Also another favorite

1939
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
at this point.

1940
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Vengeful Servant.

1941
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So Vengeful Servant,

1942
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
as the name implies,

1943
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
is another servant

1944
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
like the frog.

1945
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And this one

1946
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
will absorb damage

1947
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and then rush enemies.

1948
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,000
enemies.

1949
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And then last

1950
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
but not least,

1951
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
we've got one

1952
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
of those lost

1953
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,000
witchcraft powers

1954
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I was telling you

1955
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,000
about.

1956
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And this is

1957
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Piranado.

1958
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So this one

1959
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
procs when you

1960
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
cast other powers.

1961
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And so if you

1962
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
cast a hex

1963
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and an aura

1964
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
at the same time

1965
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
and inflict it

1966
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
upon an enemy,

1967
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
there's a chance

1968
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
that you will

1969
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
then proc

1970
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
the Piranado.

1971
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and the Piranado

1972
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
as you can see

1973
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
sucks everything

1974
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,000
into it

1975
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
in a swirling

1976
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
dervish

1977
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
of fish

1978
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and destruction.

1979
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So yeah,

1980
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
that's a peek

1981
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
at some of the

1982
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,000
witchcraft powers

1983
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
you're going to be

1984
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
able to play with soon.

1985
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
But what good

1986
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
are powers

1987
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
if we aren't

1988
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
offering you

1989
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
some new activities

1990
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
within the season

1991
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
to participate in?

1992
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And so these

1993
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
come in the form

1994
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
of head hunts.

1995
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Now head hunts

1996
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
are

1997
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
a whisper

1998
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
driven activity.

1999
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And so the tree

2000
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
is searching

2001
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
for these head rotten.

2002
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
The tree wants you

2003
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,000
to eliminate

2004
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
these head rotten.

2005
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And so it's going

2006
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
to help you

2007
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,000
by highlighting

2008
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
areas within the world

2009
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
where it thinks

2010
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,000
there's a lot of

2011
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
head rotten

2012
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,000
for you to kill.

2013
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So you're going

2014
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
to follow the whispers

2015
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
in order to

2016
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
find the head hunts

2017
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and kill the head rotten.

2018
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Now these are

2019
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
subzone takeovers

2020
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
similar to hell tides.

2021
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
They're going

2022
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,000
to feature

2023
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
a number

2024
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
of all new whispers

2025
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
mixed in

2026
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
with some existing ones.

2027
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
This was an opportunity

2028
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
for our team

2029
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,000
to try out

2030
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
some new whispers

2031
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and really

2032
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
kind of tell

2033
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,000
a little bit

2034
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
of a story

2035
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,000
each time

2036
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
you're going

2037
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
out on a head hunt

2038
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
because whispers

2039
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
offer us

2040
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,000
that opportunity.

2041
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Now completing whispers

2042
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
has a chance

2043
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,000
of spawning

2044
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
a head rotten boss

2045
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
and the head rotten bosses

2046
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,000
are the things

2047
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
you're really going

2048
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
to be looking out for

2049
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,000
because those

2050
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
are going to give you

2051
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
some additional rewards

2052
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm going to tell you about.

2053
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Delivering a head rotten

2054
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
boss's head

2055
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
to the tree of whispers

2056
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
enables you

2057
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,000
to earn

2058
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
occult gems.

2059
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Let's talk about

2060
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
occult gems.

2061
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Now we're pretty excited

2062
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
about these.

2063
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Occult gems

2064
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
are special

2065
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
socketables

2066
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
that have unique effects

2067
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
that help you

2068
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
fine tune your build.

2069
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So

2070
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
they can only

2071
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
be slotted

2072
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
in the jewelry slot

2073
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and so this is a way

2074
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
of basically

2075
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
having them

2076
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,000
coexist

2077
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
with runes

2078
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and

2079
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
they only

2080
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
last for the season.

2081
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
So when your items

2082
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,000
transfer to the

2083
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
eternal realm

2084
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
at the end of the season

2085
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
these are going to disappear.

2086
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,000
But

2087
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
in the meantime

2088
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I think you're going

2089
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
to have a lot of fun

2090
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,000
with them.

2091
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Let's dive into them

2092
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
a little bit.

2093
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So

2094
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
each occult gem

2095
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
has built in defense.

2096
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
We don't want you

2097
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
to have to make a choice

2098
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,000
between

2099
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
you know

2100
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
a royal diamond

2101
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
mineral oil skull

2102
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and an occult gem.

2103
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So

2104
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
all of these

2105
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
occult gems

2106
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,000
have defense

2107
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
built into them

2108
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
so that

2109
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
you know

2110
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
really you're getting

2111
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
a bonus

2112
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
above and beyond

2113
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,000
you know

2114
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
those gems

2115
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
that I just described.

2116
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And so

2117
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
here are some examples

2118
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,000
of them.

2119
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,000
First up

2120
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
we've got

2121
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
the elder sigil.

2122
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
This

2123
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
is going to boost

2124
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
your damage

2125
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
whenever you hex enemies.

2126
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
So if you're leaning

2127
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
into certain types

2128
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
of hexes

2129
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,000
you like using

2130
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
elder sigil

2131
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
may be a good fit

2132
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
for you.

2133
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Killing wind

2134
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
this is going to boost

2135
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
your crit

2136
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and move

2137
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
for folks

2138
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
who really

2139
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
dig

2140
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
you know

2141
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
specking out

2142
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
with eldritch powers.

2143
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,000
So if you

2144
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
equip three or more

2145
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
eldritch powers

2146
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
then

2147
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
slotting a killing wind

2148
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,000
into say

2149
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
one of your rings

2150
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
might benefit you

2151
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
quite a bit.

2152
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And then finally

2153
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
we've got dust stone.

2154
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
This is a legendary one

2155
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,000
so it's going to be

2156
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
even more powerful

2157
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
than the other two

2158
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I talked about.

2159
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
This is going to boost

2160
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
when you use

2161
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
hex and aura

2162
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and afflict other

2163
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
enemies with those.

2164
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So each time

2165
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
you do that

2166
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
not only do you

2167
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,000
have a chance

2168
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
to proc that

2169
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,000
piranado

2170
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I talked about

2171
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,000
before

2172
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
but you're going

2173
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
to increase

2174
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
the damage

2175
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
that you output

2176
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,000
per affliction.

2177
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
So you can kind

2178
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,000
of get a sense

2179
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
that the occult gems

2180
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
are providing you

2181
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
even more incentives

2182
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
for you know

2183
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
creating a certain

2184
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
type of build

2185
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and you know

2186
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
we are just

2187
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
really excited

2188
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
to see what kind

2189
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,000
of combinations

2190
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
you all come up

2191
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,000
with.

2192
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I think yeah

2193
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
it's going to be

2194
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
pretty exciting.

2195
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So final thing

2196
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
is you know

2197
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
we were doing a lot

2198
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,000
with the tree of whispers

2199
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
we've got the witches

2200
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
around them

2201
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
you know

2202
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
so we thought

2203
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
well we should

2204
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,000
you know

2205
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
take some of the

2206
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
quality of life feedback

2207
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
we've heard from players

2208
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
and try and address it.

2209
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So the first thing

2210
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
we've done

2211
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
is we've updated

2212
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
the town

2213
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
around the tree

2214
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000
of whispers

2215
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
we added some

2216
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,000
more services

2217
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
to it

2218
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
because we expect

2219
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,000
you to be returning

2220
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
to it a lot more

2221
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
this season

2222
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
and we've

2223
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
changed the layout

2224
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
a little bit

2225
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,000
to make it a little

2226
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
more convenient

2227
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
to navigate

2228
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
and move the waypoint

2229
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,000
so that it's just

2230
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
quicker to get

2231
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
to the tree of whispers

2232
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
to turn in things.

2233
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,000
But sometimes

2234
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
you know

2235
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
you're in the middle

2236
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
of a headhunt

2237
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,000
we found

2238
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and you're getting

2239
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
a lot of grim favor

2240
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
but you don't

2241
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,000
want to leave

2242
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
you want to try

2243
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
and go fight

2244
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,000
the boss

2245
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,000
that you just

2246
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
summoned right.

2247
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So we've also

2248
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,000
implemented

2249
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
what we call

2250
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
the raven of the tree

2251
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
and a raven of the tree

2252
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
appears in every

2253
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
headhunt zone

2254
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and that allows

2255
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
you to turn in

2256
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
your grim favor

2257
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,000
on the spot

2258
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
so that you don't

2259
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
have to go back

2260
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,000
to the tree town.

2261
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Now you're not

2262
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,000
going to have access

2263
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
to all those

2264
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
other services

2265
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
so you know

2266
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,000
you hit your

2267
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
inventory limit

2268
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,000
you'll probably

2269
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
want to go back

2270
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,000
to town

2271
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
but in the moment

2272
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
when you're in a flow

2273
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
you can go to

2274
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
the raven of the tree

2275
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
get your cash

2276
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
and then keep fighting.

2277
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And then finally

2278
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
we felt like

2279
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
we wanted to expand

2280
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
the rewards

2281
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,000
a little bit more

2282
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
for the tree of whispers

2283
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
so we've added

2284
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
ancestral caches

2285
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
it's a pretty low

2286
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
probability of getting

2287
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
one but they're there

2288
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
and these guarantee

2289
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
you getting an

2290
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
ancestral item

2291
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
from a cache

2292
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,000
so obviously

2293
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
you see this pop up

2294
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I have a feeling

2295
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,000
you're probably

2296
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
going to select it

2297
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
so yeah

2298
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I think that's

2299
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
all I have

2300
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
to talk about

2301
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
for the upcoming

2302
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,000
PTR

2303
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
so I'll kick it

2304
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
back over to you

2305
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Adam.

2306
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Awesome

2307
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
thank you so much

2308
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Dan

2309
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
talking about

2310
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
a ton of new stuff

2311
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
coming for

2312
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Patch 2.1

2313
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
PTR

2314
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and of course

2315
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
season 7

2316
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm super excited

2317
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,000
for all the

2318
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
tree of whisper

2319
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,000
updates

2320
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I know

2321
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
a lot of people

2322
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
in chat are

2323
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,000
especially with

2324
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
the raven

2325
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,000
not having to

2326
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
go back

2327
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,000
to the tree

2328
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
of whispers

2329
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,000
every single time

2330
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
being able to

2331
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
turn in grim favors

2332
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,000
right there

2333
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
through the raven

2334
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
on top of that

2335
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
also just the

2336
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
rework of the zone

2337
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
so everything's

2338
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,000
a little bit closer

2339
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and I have to

2340
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
walk all the way

2341
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,000
across

2342
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
to walk all the way

2343
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,000
back to the way

2344
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,000
point

2345
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
or to get to

2346
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
the vendors

2347
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and everything

2348
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
so there's a lot

2349
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,000
of big changes

2350
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
with that

2351
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
and please do

2352
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
choose the ancestral

2353
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:39,000
patch

2354
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
why would you not

2355
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and I think

2356
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
it's important

2357
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,000
to remember

2358
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
we added the

2359
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,000
ability to

2360
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
favorite way

2361
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,000
points

2362
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
as part of

2363
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
season 6

2364
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
or the last

2365
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
patch that we

2366
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,000
did

2367
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
so it's super

2368
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,000
helpful with

2369
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
that witch tone

2370
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
yeah most

2371
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000
definitely

2372
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
and of course

2373
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
people have

2374
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
been seeing

2375
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,000
some of the

2376
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
new witchcraft

2377
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,000
powers

2378
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and noticing

2379
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
some familiarities

2380
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
of past

2381
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Diablo lore

2382
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and I will say

2383
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,000
we'll be talking

2384
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
more about

2385
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,000
the story

2386
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
of season 7

2387
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,000
as we get

2388
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
closer to launch

2389
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
so players

2390
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
can hear more

2391
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
about kind of

2392
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
like the origins

2393
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
of what we've

2394
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,000
been kind of

2395
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
talking about

2396
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
here with this

2397
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,000
story with

2398
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Diablo 4

2399
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
so thank you

2400
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,000
again Dan

2401
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
for walking

2402
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,000
us through

2403
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
all the content

2404
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,000
that's coming

2405
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
with season 7

2406
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and of course

2407
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
last but not

2408
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,000
least we do

2409
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
want to talk

2410
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,000
about some

2411
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
big quality

2412
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
of life changes

2413
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,000
one really

2414
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
really big

2415
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
one that we're

2416
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,000
really excited

2417
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
to talk about

2418
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
and Mr. Colin

2419
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Feiner will talk

2420
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,000
and walk us

2421
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
through everything

2422
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
thanks Adam

2423
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
so most of

2424
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
these are sort

2425
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,000
of systemic

2426
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
updates

2427
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
so I'll talk

2428
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,000
through them

2429
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Paragon migration

2430
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
is more just a

2431
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,000
reminder on how

2432
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
the new Paragon

2433
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
system works

2434
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
all of the

2435
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Paragon experience

2436
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,000
that you've earned

2437
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
in a season

2438
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
is actually at the

2439
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
end of season 6

2440
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
going to be added

2441
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
to your Eternal

2442
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Realm Paragon

2443
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
so what that

2444
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
means is

2445
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
if you're Paragon

2446
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
level 230 on a

2447
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,000
season

2448
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
all of that

2449
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
230 worth of

2450
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,000
experience is going

2451
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
to get added to

2452
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
your Eternal

2453
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,000
which probably is

2454
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
going to level up

2455
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,000
your Eternal

2456
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Paragon

2457
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,000
and I mention

2458
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
this because

2459
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
we added the

2460
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
really cool

2461
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Soulstone

2462
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I kept calling it

2463
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
the Vessel of

2464
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Hatred Crystal

2465
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
but that's a

2466
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Soulstone

2467
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
that really cool

2468
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Soulstone that you

2469
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
get at Paragon

2470
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
level 300

2471
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,000
you can actually

2472
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
earn that on

2473
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Eternal

2474
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
so if you're not

2475
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000
willing to sort

2476
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
of put in

2477
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
hundreds of hours

2478
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,000
to get that

2479
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
in a season

2480
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:21,000
you can work

2481
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
your way there

2482
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,000
on the Eternal

2483
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Realm as you

2484
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,000
sort of cash

2485
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
in these seasons

2486
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
so we think

2487
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,000
that's going to

2488
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
feel pretty good

2489
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,000
it's going to be

2490
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
really nice

2491
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,000
as you're like

2492
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
playing through

2493
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,000
multiple seasonal

2494
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
characters and

2495
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,000
then eventually

2496
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
you'll end up

2497
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,000
just getting

2498
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
enough XP

2499
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
to actually

2500
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,000
earn those

2501
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
rewards at

2502
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,000
level 300

2503
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Paragon

2504
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,000
so that's

2505
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
actually

2506
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
it's not like

2507
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I have to

2508
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,000
have it in

2509
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
this season

2510
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,000
or something

2511
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
like that

2512
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,000
you know

2513
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
you probably

2514
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,000
end up getting

2515
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,000
it in a couple

2516
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
seasons

2517
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,000
if you play

2518
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
pretty extensively

2519
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,000
and you level

2520
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
up your Paragon

2521
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
yeah definitely

2522
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
the second one

2523
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
here is

2524
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
now we are

2525
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
essentially tying

2526
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,000
the unique

2527
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
powers

2528
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,000
if you think

2529
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
about like

2530
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,000
the Fists of

2531
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Fate

2532
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
that random

2533
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
damage rule

2534
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,000
from 1

2535
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
to 200

2536
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
that's going

2537
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,000
to be tied

2538
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the floor

2539
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,000
is going to be

2540
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
tied to the

2541
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,000
amount of

2542
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
greater affixes

2543
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
that are on

2544
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,000
that item

2545
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,000
so if you have

2546
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
one greater affix

2547
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
the floor is going

2548
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
to go up a little

2549
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
bit from the 1%

2550
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
when you get four

2551
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,000
greater affixes

2552
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
it's going to go up

2553
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
quite a bit

2554
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
it's not exactly

2555
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
perfect because we

2556
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,000
wanted to maintain

2557
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
the sort of

2558
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
specialness of a

2559
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
4GA with a

2560
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
perfect unique rule

2561
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
we've seen some of

2562
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
those on Reddit

2563
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,000
and I think it's

2564
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
always such a cool

2565
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
moment to sort of

2566
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,000
see those drop

2567
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
but it's going to be

2568
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
a substantial increase

2569
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
to the power of the

2570
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
floor so it's going to

2571
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
be nearly impossible

2572
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
to get a 4GA

2573
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
with a really

2574
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
crappy unique

2575
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
power rule

2576
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
it's always great

2577
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
getting a 4GA

2578
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
and then rolling it

2579
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
1%

2580
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
yeah

2581
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
that always just

2582
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,000
feels bad

2583
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
you never want

2584
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
to be comparing

2585
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
like oh I got

2586
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
a 4GA

2587
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
well my 1GA

2588
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,000
one is maybe

2589
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
better because it

2590
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
has a better

2591
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,000
unique role

2592
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
that wasn't a

2593
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,000
moment we felt

2594
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
was really enticing

2595
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,000
so we wanted to

2596
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
make sure that

2597
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
the more GAs

2598
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,000
you get

2599
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
just the better

2600
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
the item is

2601
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
comprehensively

2602
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
just better

2603
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,000
yeah

2604
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
absolutely

2605
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
so that should

2606
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,000
help quite a bit

2607
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
and then I'm going

2608
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
to talk about

2609
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
one thing

2610
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
previously on that

2611
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,000
which is

2612
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
ancestral legendaries

2613
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
they are now

2614
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,000
going to

2615
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
when an ancestral

2616
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
item drops

2617
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,000
it's going to drop

2618
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
the top end

2619
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
of the legendary

2620
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,000
aspect role

2621
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
so if you think

2622
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
in season 6

2623
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
we added 5 more

2624
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
ranks to compensate

2625
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
ancestral being added

2626
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
rank 21 is usually

2627
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,000
where they end up

2628
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,000
landing

2629
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
now ancestral items

2630
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,000
when they drop

2631
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
they're going to be

2632
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
at the top end

2633
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,000
of that

2634
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
so you should always

2635
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,000
be pretty excited

2636
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
when an ancestral

2637
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,000
drops

2638
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
because it's always

2639
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
the best

2640
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
sort of top end

2641
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
ranks of that

2642
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,000
legendary power

2643
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
that could drop

2644
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
we saw lots

2645
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
of conspiracy theories

2646
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
on reddit

2647
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
of people going

2648
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,000
like hey

2649
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I think like

2650
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
my codex of power

2651
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,000
is not getting

2652
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
updated correctly

2653
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
or something like that

2654
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
and we totally

2655
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,000
understand

2656
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
like there was a lot

2657
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
of confusion behind it

2658
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
we admit that

2659
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,000
on our end

2660
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
and this just makes

2661
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
it easier and better

2662
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,000
for players

2663
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
and being able

2664
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,000
to grab it

2665
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
it's not Colin

2666
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
behind the scenes

2667
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
on a computer

2668
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
it was

2669
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
it actually was

2670
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,000
he was literally

2671
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
just like

2672
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
making sure

2673
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,000
you got the lowest

2674
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
aspect roles

2675
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
or anything

2676
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,000
like that

2677
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,000
yeah

2678
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
grind harder

2679
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
so that

2680
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
that most definitely

2681
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
will address

2682
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
a lot of the confusion

2683
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
there as well

2684
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
as just make it

2685
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,000
better for players

2686
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
overall

2687
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
yeah definitely

2688
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and then the second

2689
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,000
point here is

2690
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
we've pretty substantially

2691
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,000
increased the ancestral

2692
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
drop rate

2693
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
across the board

2694
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
they're not going to be

2695
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
raining from the sky

2696
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
but it's definitely

2697
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
a pretty substantial

2698
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,000
increase that

2699
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
we think is just

2700
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
going to level up

2701
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,000
all the different

2702
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
activities in the game

2703
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
and that should just

2704
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
feel a lot better

2705
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
we don't want to go

2706
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
too far where

2707
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,000
they're no longer

2708
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
special

2709
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,000
but we thought

2710
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
that we were

2711
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,000
a little bit

2712
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
a little bit

2713
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
too conservative

2714
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,000
on our first swing

2715
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
and this will

2716
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
affect all torment

2717
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
tiers right

2718
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,000
not just

2719
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
torment 4

2720
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
yep exactly

2721
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,000
so all

2722
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
torment tiers

2723
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
are going to get

2724
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,000
this increase

2725
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
great

2726
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and then the next

2727
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
one

2728
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
so we saw

2729
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
that gems

2730
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,000
were dropping

2731
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
a little too

2732
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,000
frequently

2733
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
constantly

2734
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
getting stuck

2735
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
on the ground

2736
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,000
players were capped

2737
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
on them

2738
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,000
so we are doing

2739
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
a pass to reduce

2740
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
them overall

2741
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
but to compensate

2742
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
we're actually

2743
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
adding a sink

2744
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,000
for them

2745
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,000
so you're going

2746
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,000
to be able

2747
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
to take

2748
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,000
gem fragments

2749
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
and craft

2750
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
random legendary

2751
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,000
amulets

2752
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
and random

2753
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,000
legendary rings

2754
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
those all

2755
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
obviously have a

2756
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,000
chance to be

2757
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
ancestral

2758
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
once you get

2759
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
into the torment

2760
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,000
so it's a really

2761
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
nice way for us

2762
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
to sort of

2763
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
make sure that

2764
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,000
you're never

2765
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
hitting a point

2766
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
where you just

2767
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,000
have so many

2768
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
gem fragments

2769
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
they're worthless

2770
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,000
awesome

2771
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,000
yeah

2772
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
and then

2773
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
the next one

2774
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I think is going

2775
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,000
to be

2776
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I'm super

2777
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,000
excited about

2778
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
and that's

2779
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
class quest

2780
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
updates

2781
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
they're going

2782
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,000
to work

2783
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
similar to

2784
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
altars of

2785
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Lilith

2786
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
do you have

2787
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,000
more details

2788
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,000
on that

2789
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
yeah

2790
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
so class quest

2791
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
so most

2792
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,000
classes

2793
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
or every class

2794
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,000
has this

2795
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
special mechanics

2796
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,000
so like

2797
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
on sorceress

2798
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
you've got

2799
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,000
your enchantment

2800
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
slots

2801
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
and in the past

2802
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
when you hit

2803
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,000
level 15

2804
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
you'd get a quest

2805
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
where you had

2806
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,000
to go and

2807
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
help out a mage

2808
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
to find a lost

2809
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
home

2810
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
so for players

2811
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
who have already

2812
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
completed that

2813
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,000
you are going

2814
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
to

2815
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:38,000
if you

2816
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
you do need

2817
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,000
to log into

2818
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
that character

2819
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,000
first

2820
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
to kind of

2821
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,000
unlock it

2822
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
across your

2823
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,000
account

2824
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
but once you've

2825
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:44,000
done that

2826
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
any subsequent

2827
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
sorceress that

2828
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,000
you make

2829
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
once you hit

2830
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
level 15

2831
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
you're going to

2832
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,000
immediately unlock

2833
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
that first

2834
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,000
enchantment slot

2835
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
and then once

2836
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
you hit level 30

2837
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
you'll unlock

2838
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,000
the second one

2839
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
now for every

2840
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
class the exact

2841
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
level is going

2842
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,000
to be different

2843
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
it depends on

2844
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
when that would

2845
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,000
normally unlock

2846
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
but you won't

2847
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,000
have to go

2848
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
through the whole

2849
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,000
quest line

2850
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
to do so

2851
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
but for those

2852
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,000
of you who

2853
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
really enjoyed

2854
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,000
doing those

2855
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,000
quests

2856
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
there will be

2857
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
a pretty juicy

2858
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,000
reward if you

2859
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
do choose to

2860
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,000
do it

2861
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
but you're

2862
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,000
going to get

2863
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
that mechanic

2864
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,000
right off the

2865
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
bat

2866
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
that's awesome

2867
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,000
and you could

2868
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
still just log

2869
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,000
into your

2870
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
seasonal character

2871
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
and do it

2872
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,000
to unlock

2873
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,000
the class

2874
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
mechanic

2875
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,000
we don't

2876
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
require you

2877
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,000
to log

2878
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,000
into your

2879
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
eternal character

2880
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
to get this

2881
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
cool

2882
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,000
so I think

2883
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
that's going

2884
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,000
to be awesome

2885
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I always

2886
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
check the

2887
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
time

2888
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,000
like oh

2889
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I'm level

2890
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,000
40

2891
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I should

2892
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
probably

2893
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,000
go do

2894
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
my class

2895
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,000
quest

2896
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I have

2897
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,000
definitely

2898
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
forgotten

2899
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,000
to unlock

2900
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,000
my golem

2901
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
on my

2902
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
necromancers

2903
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,000
for a little

2904
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
longer than

2905
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I would like

2906
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,000
to admit

2907
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
well production

2908
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
spoiled it

2909
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
as they raise

2910
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,000
their hands

2911
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,000
up in the air

2912
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
but the next

2913
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
update is

2914
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
obviously a big

2915
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
one which is

2916
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
finally we don't

2917
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
have to say

2918
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,000
this is in

2919
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
development

2920
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Armory

2921
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Armory is

2922
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
coming with

2923
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
season 7

2924
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
patch 2.1

2925
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
so Colin

2926
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
want to go

2927
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,000
through it

2928
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,000
all

2929
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000

2930
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,000
yeah

2931
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,000
this one

2932
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
was a

2933
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,000
really

2934
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,000
niche

2935
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
request

2936
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,000
we had

2937
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,000
to dive

2938
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
super

2939
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,000
deep

2940
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,000
into the

2941
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,000

2942
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000

who asked

2945
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000

2946
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,000

unique

3011
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
now it's

01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,000
really easy

3013
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,000

3017
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,000

3020
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,000
want

3026
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,000
and

3027
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,000
you

3028
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,000

01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
start

3030
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,000

we're

3044
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000

3045
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:33,000

01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
and

3087
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,000
that's

3088
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,000
really

3089
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,000
important

3090
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,000
to

3091
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
know

3092
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,000
because

3093
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,000
we're

3094
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,000
just

3095
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
saving

3096
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,000
the

3097
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,000
equipment

3098
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
right

3099
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,000
so

3100
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
you'll

3101
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,000
want

3102
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,000
to

3103
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,000
know

3104
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,000
if

3105
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,000
you're

3106
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,000
going

3107
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
to

3108
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,000
modify

3109
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,000
this

3110
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,000
item

3111
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,000
that

3112
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
it

3113
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,000
would

3114
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,000
affect

3115
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,000
any

3116
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,000
of

3117
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
the

3118
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,000
loadouts

3119
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,000
that

3120
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,000
are

3121
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,000
currently

3122
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
using

3123
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,000
this

3124
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,000
item

3125
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
yeah

3126
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,000
if

3127
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,000
you

3128
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,000
take

3129
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,000
a

3130
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
legendary

3131
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,000
and

3132
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,000
say

3133
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
change

3134
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,000
the

3135
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,000
imprinted

3136
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,000
aspect

3137
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
on

3138
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,000
it

3139
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,000
you know

3140
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,000
it

3141
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
it's

3142
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,000
still

3143
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,000
part

3144
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,000
of

3145
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
that

3146
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
build

3147
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
so

3148
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
it

3149
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
might

3150
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
not

3151
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
be

3152
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
the

3153
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
right

3154
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
one

3155
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
so

3156
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
you

3157
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,000
do

3158
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
probably

3159
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,000
want

3160
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,000
to

3161
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,000
get

3162
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,000
multiple

3163
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
sets

3164
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
of

3165
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
gear

3166
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
if

3167
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
you

3168
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
want

3169
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
to

3170
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
be

3171
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,000
building

3172
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,000
up

3173
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,000
but

3174
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
it's

3175
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,000
so much

3176
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
easier to

3177
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:07,000
explore

3178
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
all the

3179
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,000
new

3180
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,000
build

3181
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
possibilities

3182
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,000
that

3183
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,000
we

3184
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
introduce

3185
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,000
every

3186
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,000
season

3187
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,000
with

3188
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
the

3189
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,000
new

3190
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,000
items

3191
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,000
and

3192
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
updates

3193
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
absolutely

3194
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,000
and

3195
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
it's

3196
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,000
in

3197
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,000
all

3198
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,000
the

3199
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,000
main

3200
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
towns

3201
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
it's

3202
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
even

3203
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
in

3204
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
the

3205
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
training

3206
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,000
rooms

3207
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,000
which

3208
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,000
is

3209
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
very

3210
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,000
nice

3211
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and

3212
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,000
it's

3213
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,000
important

3214
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
to

3215
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,000
note

3216
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,000
that

3217
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,000
we

3218
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,000
will

3219
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
swap

3220
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
it

3221
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
from

3222
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
anywhere

3223
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
so

3224
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
if

3225
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,000

you

3238
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,000
don't

3239
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,000
have

3240
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,000
to

3241
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,000
worry

3242
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
about

01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,000
it

3244
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,000
we'll

3245
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,000
just

3246
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,000
swap

3247
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,000
it

3248
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
out

3249
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,000
for

3250
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,000
you

3251
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,000
it

3252
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
it

which

3257
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,000
is

3258
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
really

3259
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,000
nice

3260
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
it

3261
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:31,000
makes

3262
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,000
removed

a lot

3264
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,000

the

think

3273
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,000
this

3274
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,000
should

then

3921
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,000
PTR

3922
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
is

3923
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,000
planning

3924
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,000

3rd

3929
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,000
so

3930
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,000
players

3931
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
will

3932
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,000
be

3933
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,000
able

3934
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,000
to

01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,000

3938
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,000
then

3939
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
of course

3940
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,000
it

3941
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,000
is

3942
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,000
just

3945
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
easier

3946
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,000

3947
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000

01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:07,000

01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:07,000

01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
updates

3954
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,000
and

3955
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,000
everything

3956
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,000

01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,000

we

01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,000
you know

3986
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
we'll try

01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:19,000

3988
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:19,000

01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,000
there's

3999
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,000

no one

see

4007
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,000
but

4008
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
will

4009
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:25,000
all

4014
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000

4015
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,000
split

4016
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,000

out

4018
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
we

4019
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,000
will

4020
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,000

4026
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000

day

4030
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
one

4031
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,000
so

4032
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,000
players

4033
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
can

4034
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,000
jump

4036
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
and

4037
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,000
actually

4038
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
check

4039
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,000
out

4040
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,000
everything

4041
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
related

4042
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
to

4043
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,000
patch

4044
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
2.1

4045
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
immediately

4046
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,000
with

4047
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,000
day

4048
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
one

4049
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,000
whenever

4050
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
they

4051
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,000
need

4052
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,000
to

4053
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
so

4054
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,000
shouldn't

4055
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,000
be

4056
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,000
a

4057
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
problem

4058
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
jumping

4059
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,000
into

4060
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,000
some

4061
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
questions

4062
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
small

4063
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
petting

4064
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
zoo

4065
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
they're

4066
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
a

4067
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,000
person

4068
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,000
that

4069
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,000
plays

4070
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
a

4071
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,000
lot

4072
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,000
of

4073
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
companions

4074
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I

4075
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,000
would

4076
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,000
imagine

4077
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
based

4078
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,000
on

4079
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,000
the

4080
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,000
name

4081
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
so

4082
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,000
they're

4083
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
asking

4084
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,000
will

4085
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Will there be fixes to Storm and Werewolf tags given to Druid Wolves by the item Storm's Companion?

4086
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
They have never functioned, would more than double the damage of the build.

4087
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Yes, actually, as part of that comprehensive update that I mentioned to summons across the game,

4088
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I did take a pass to look at specifically updating how the Wolves interact with Storm's Companion.

4089
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And now, whenever they're imbued with a lightning from Storm's Companion,

4090
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
they do count as lightning skills.

4091
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:42,000
And because the, you know, not to get too technical, but because the way the damage is calculated and attributed,

4092
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
it should also work with all the things that say, hey, when you deal lightning damage, do something special.

4093
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Your lightning wolves are going to be triggering and interacting with all those effects.

4094
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It should be, it should work in every way that you're expecting to going forward.

4095
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Awesome. Sharky pets.

4096
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
A question from Narrator Dog.

4097
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
How does this fit into, how does the Season 7 stuff fit into lore?

4098
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Because during Vessel of Hatred and the tree seemed to be on good terms.

4099
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Dan, I don't know if you want to answer this or if you want me to answer it.

4100
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Up to you.

4101
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Yeah, so I'll say, first off, we're not going to get too deep of an answer.

4102
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:28,000
We're going to reveal more about the story as we get closer to the release of Season 7.

4103
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:39,000
That said, we are really looking at trying to build upon the events of Vessel of Hatred with every season moving forward.

4104
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And so you'll start seeing changes in the world as we do that.

4105
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
And I'll leave it at that.

4106
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Cool.

4107
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
You'll hear more soon.

4108
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Again, we plan on doing a more grandiose reveal of Season 7 content in the story as we get closer to the release.

4109
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,000
So you'll hear more about kind of like the backstory of everything and how the Tree of Whispers plays into everything as well.

4110
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Question from Toothless81.

4111
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Is there going to be a rework or cost reduction to masterworking?

4112
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Veil Crystals have become a huge roadblock with trying to gear multiple alts.

4113
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Yeah, I think we are always keeping our eye on the economy.

4114
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
We did a big pass.

4115
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
If you remember, we did a stream last week that was talking about tightening up the economy.

4116
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
So we do intend on taking a look at just generally how things are playing out.

4117
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I think alts is something that we need to definitely be taking a look at.

4118
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
We do want to encourage alt gameplay.

4119
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
That was part of the big Paragon changes.

4120
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
So that sort of feedback is super valuable.

4121
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
It's really good to know that Veiled Crystals are that alt blocker.

4122
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
We want to make sure that alts are something that players are really excited about if that's something that they want to pursue.

4123
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
So I appreciate that.

4124
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Question related to stacking items.

4125
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
This is from Marwan Gaming.

4126
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Any plans on the amount that you can stack?

4127
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Like items, potions, light, potions, keys, and runes?

4128
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Wow, I can't read.

4129
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Any updates?

4130
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Or are we looking at any of that type of thing?

4131
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
We definitely are looking at it.

4132
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
We don't have anything to share, but it's top of mind.

4133
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I know that boss materials, for example, are at 50.

4134
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
There are some technical reasons why we have it like that, but it's something we are actively looking at.

4135
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Dracronia mentions, do you know if XP wells are getting fixed?

4136
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And do you know if there's an opportunity for maybe pets collecting loot a little bit faster?

4137
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Anything on the screen for players?

4138
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I know that XP well definitely has been reported, and it's something we're looking into.

4139
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So we know about it.

4140
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
We're looking at it.

4141
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
This is part of the PTR is to find a lot more of these types of problems.

4142
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So we will look at it.

4143
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
As far as the pets, no plans at the moment.

4144
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I know we've done a big pass on a lot of things to essentially make sure that when a rare item drops in Torment,

4145
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
it's just going to get auto-salvaged.

4146
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
So we do try and essentially make a lot more of the loot just auto-pick-up-able.

4147
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Question from MagsPVE.

4148
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Will Druid ever see some love for Ravens?

4149
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It would be awesome to have maybe a different companion outside of the wolves and everything that they have right now,

4150
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
or the vines and stuff.

4151
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Is there any plans for maybe adjustments to Ravens in the future?

4152
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah, absolutely.

4153
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Ravens, one of the three companions compared to the wolves and the vine creeper,

4154
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
which I think are often a bit more of the marquee ones in the companion builds, at least as they currently are.

4155
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
That's something we're definitely aware of.

4156
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And going forward, when we look to make new effects for these companion builds,

4157
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I think Ravens might be maybe the next one we start looking at.

4158
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Nothing I can commit to firmly at this point.

4159
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
But it's definitely something that we have noticed, and yeah, it's something we'll keep in mind.

4160
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,000
So we appreciate that.

4161
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Part of that summoning tag update was really to sort of give us more tools to do things like improve the Raven experience or the Ancients experience.

4162
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

4163
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I think that summon update is going to be really huge for companion druids and every other build that uses these.

4164
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And we'll definitely look at it under that new lens after this update and see where we can make further improvements.

4165
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
We'll do one last question, but this is like a two-parter question from two different people.

4166
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
One's from TeampoDiavlo4.

4167
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
The other one's from Dejal22.

4168
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
And they're both related to Armory.

4169
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Will items in the Armory be locked from accidentally selling them?

4170
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And separately, will saved items for Armory builds have like maybe an icon or something associated to them to kind of like call them out that they are part of a saved build?

4171
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Yeah.

4172
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
So when you do save a loadout, we favorite all of those items.

4173
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So just automatically that happens.

4174
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
No mistaken like, oh, crap.

4175
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
You'd have to unfavorite it, then sell it.

4176
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And then at that point, it's like, well, it's sort of on you.

4177
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And then the second part is, yes, there is a little icon that does indicate that, hey, this is part of an Armory.

4178
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Cool.

4179
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
So, yeah, you know that like, hey, this is part of a build.

4180
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Don't mess with it.

4181
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Don't accidentally unfavorite it or anything like that, which is good to know.

4182
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
So, cool.

4183
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Well, we, again, thank you guys for tuning in for our Patch 2.1 PTR stream.

4184
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I know there's a lot of news coming down the line for Diablo 4 as we get closer to 2.1.

4185
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
But we do have a blog that will be going live this afternoon and probably right after this stream.

4186
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
And, again, our patch notes, the full patch notes for this PTR will be next Wednesday.

4187
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
So, it's a little bit of a delay, mainly due to the holidays and us doing the stream a little bit early.

4188
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Normally, we have the patch notes immediately after the stream.

4189
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,000
So, there's going to be way more content beyond what we just talked about here in those patch notes for people to actually check out.

4190
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And, of course, Patch 2.1 PTR is launching on December 3rd for PC Battle.net users.

4191
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So, really looking forward to people jumping in, trying everything that we talked about today, including the new features, including the Armory, including all the Season 7 stuff with Witchcraft powers and Occult Gems that we actually heard from Dan as well.

4192
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
So, huge thanks to Dan out in Albany.

4193
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
And, of course, thank you, Colin.

4194
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Thank you, Charles, for talking us through all the content that's going to be coming with Patch 2.1 PTR.

4195
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:33,000
And, yeah, we'll see you guys probably after the holidays, but we'll see you in the PTR for sure.

4196
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
And we'll check you guys out in Haantu.

4197
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,000
See you guys.

4198
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Thanks.

4199
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Thanks.

4200
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,000
So.
