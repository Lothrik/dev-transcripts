Thank you.

11
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:29,000


12
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:59,000


13
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:29,000


14
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:59,000


15
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thank you.

16
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000


17
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:29,000


18
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:59,000

21
00:09:31,000 --> 00:10:01,000


22
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:31,000


23
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you.

24
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:31,000


25
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Thank you.

26
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Thank you.

27
00:12:31,000 --> 00:13:01,000


28
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:31,000


29
00:13:31,000 --> 00:14:01,000


30
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:31,000


31
00:14:31,000 --> 00:15:01,000


32
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thank you.

33
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Thank you.

34
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Thank you.

35
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Thank you.

36
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you.

37
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And you're the first thing.

38
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thank you.

39
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The eye on the screen has many functions.

40
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It keeps me in the right frame of mind.

41
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
mind. What we are doing is dark. It should be horrifying. I should feel the fear while

42
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm doing it. It's a reminder of that. The eye also serves as a warning. Like get moving.

43
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't dwell too long and wander around, you know. Get this thing moving. Get the work

44
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
done.

45
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Hello Diablo community. Welcome to another Diablo 4 Campfire Chat. We end with a creepy

46
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
eyeball we were just talking about. This one is our patch 2.1 PTR Campfire Chat. I know

47
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
we were just here last week when we were talking about the mid-season update, but this one is

48
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
kind of like the big one because we're going to be talking about everything coming

49
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
at patch 2.1 and season 7. I am joined here by Mr. Colin Feiner, Mr. Charles Dunn, who

50
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
have appeared on prior Campfire Chats. We were going to have Adam Jackson. He is unfortunately

51
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
not feeling very well, so we hope he gets better soon. And we do also have another guest here

52
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
who is live from Albany, Blizzard Albany, and that is Mr. Dan Tanguay, who's going to be

53
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
talking a little bit as well about what's coming up for patch 2.1. And he's showing off his

54
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
red Diablo 4 jacket. We have our new black Diablo 4 jackets as well. Look at this. Models.

55
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How are you, Dan? Hopefully you're good.

56
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Can he hear me?

57
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And he's not sure if he can hear me.

58
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't know.

59
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But either way, either way, a few things that we do want to talk about before we actually

60
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
do jump into everything. Obviously, PTR is coming up soon. We are doing this stream a little early

61
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
this time, mainly because the Thanksgiving holiday is coming up here in the U.S., and so we are going

62
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
to be talking about some of the contents before even the patch notes are ready. We do plan on having

63
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
a blog immediately after this stream, so players can actually check out the blog and read a little

64
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
bit more about what we talked about today. But the patch notes will be available next Wednesday

65
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
for players to actually check out. So it will be before the U.S. holiday here, so everyone can kind

66
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
of dive deep into the patch notes for PTR. PTR is currently planned to start on December 3rd,

67
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
so that will be after the U.S. holidays here for Thanksgiving. So there's a ton of stuff that

68
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
is coming up for players to kind of jump into. But I know what we want to do is really just dive

69
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
straight deep into all the new stuff that we do want to talk about. So for the first thing we do want

70
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
to chat about is just season seven and what that's going to be. So we're actually going to jump over to

71
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Mr. Dan Tanguay in Albany to kind of walk us through. So Dan, do you want to

72
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
take over?

73
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh no.

74
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Dan, Dan can't currently hear.

75
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
All right, what happened?

76
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So I don't know what happened. I mean, you know, maybe, maybe we don't have satellites working or

77
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
something like that. So instead, I guess we'll just start with classes first.

78
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Sure.

79
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So Mr. Charles Dunn, do you want to talk about class changes that are coming with season seven?

80
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I know we talked a little bit about this last week with Adam Jackson.

81
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Mm-hmm.

82
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Just a reminder, Spirit Born, expect that to be addressed for season seven. And we will actually

83
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
be talking a little bit about that now. So Charles, take us through.

84
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, absolutely. I'd love to talk about some of the changes coming to all the different classes in

85
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Diablo 4, as well as some broader, more systemic updates that are happening that kind of affect all

86
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
classes equally in a way. Yeah, so like I said, just going through individual class by class,

87
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
seeing some of the new stuff that's coming for a lot of classes. Let's start with the Barbarian,

88
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I believe, is the first one up. Yeah, so Barbarian is definitely a class that, you know,

89
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
we think a lot of the classes have been performing pretty well across the board. They're always a step

90
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
under the Spirit Born, but Barbarian maybe a step and a half below. And so we're looking at a lot of

91
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
buffs across the board for them here, specifically looking at some stuff with Hammer of the Ancients,

92
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
buffing that number up here. A little bit of a rework to the Walking Arsenal passive. Previously,

93
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the bonus was just 8%. Now we're going to be giving you a bigger bonus, and when you have all of them

94
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
active, you're going to get more attack speed and some bonus crowd control duration, which we think

95
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
really plays into that kind of build. Additionally, we're also updating Earthquakes, that has been

96
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
one of my favorite builds on Barbarian, right? Just seeing those big earthquakes come out everywhere.

97
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Leafquake is the best. Oh, I absolutely love it. You know, the visuals on that is just top-notch.

98
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So we're really, we took some lessons from what we did on Rogues in the past with their

99
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
stun grenades power, where a lot of the legendaries that talked to stun grenades also had kind of this

100
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
extra bit where it increased the damage of all of your stun grenades, so that you kind of got these

101
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
synergistic builds with the various aspects all together. And we're extending that over to

102
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Earthquakes now here. So we're adding on basically, hey, all these ones that talked to Earthquakes, just

103
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
they increase the damage of all of them overall. Yeah, it's a little bit less finicky too,

104
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
right? Because now it lasts after the Earthquake expires, or if you believe it.

105
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Absolutely. So we think this would just be a much more comprehensive build overall. We've also got

106
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
new Legendary that talks directly to Earthquakes as well, ups their damage, and increases their fire,

107
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
turns it into fire damage. And I think this is really cool. And we're going to see some more stuff

108
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
as you actually get onto the PTR, but I think Earthquakes and Hammer of the Ancients might be a

109
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
build that you're going to be very interested in combining those two with some of the stuff that

110
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
you will see come PTR. All right, let's move on to the Source, the Sorceress.

111
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Sorceress, one of the key notes that we've noticed with, well, Sorceress over the whole lifespan of Diablo

112
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
as Diablo 4 is that players often felt like they were pigeonholed into burning builds in particular.

113
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Firebolt enchantment is probably the most used enchantment by far because it was just kind of a

114
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
free way to apply a very small amount of burning to enemies. But that was what you needed to turn

115
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
on a lot of the passives in their skill tree. And that was a powerful build, powerful interactions,

116
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
but we felt like that was making everything a little too homogenous. You felt like you had to do this in

117
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
order to access a lot of these passives. And so we decided that we really want these burning synergies

118
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
to really be benefiting builds that are dedicated to burning type builds and not just ones who are

119
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
splashing it in with a Firebolt enchantment. And so with that in mind, we did a rework on the enchantment to

120
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
increase the, or remove the burning damage from the enchantment and change it over to this which has a

121
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
healing component to it. And then we also updated a lot of those burning passes to really play better

122
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
in the dedicated Fire based builds rather than being something that you just want to splash into

123
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
everything. Yeah, hopefully there's a lot more build variety. Absolutely. Yeah, that is one of the main

124
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
driving goals of a lot of our updates is increasing that build variety so you don't feel like you have

125
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
to take this checklist of mandatory things before moving on to what you actually want for your build.

126
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So an example here on Devouring Blaze, you've got a bonus, previously it was bonus critical strike

127
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
damage against burning enemies, no matter how much they're burning for. So you just apply that little

128
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
bit of burning and you would get this. Now instead, you get a bigger bonus, but it's just for your

129
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
pyromancy critical strike skills. So it really encourages, hey, you're a fireball build, you're a

130
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
meteor build, something that wants to do those big fire crits. Devouring Blaze is now even more valuable

131
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
for those builds and it's not something that you necessarily need to or feel compelled to splash in other builds.

132
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
All right, on to the next one. We also did some updates for Ball Lightning. So Ball Lightning,

133
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
the previous upgrades, like kind of these mages Ball Lightning and wizards Ball Lightning,

134
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
were about stunning enemies or spawning some crack in energy with, admittedly, some kind of complex

135
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
conditions. You had to jump through a lot of hoops to get these. One of the things we really like to

136
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
do with a lot of these updates is simplify them down and streamline and really focus in on what the

137
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
the interesting factor is. Yeah, it makes it a little bit more modular too, right? So there's

138
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
more builds, the less sort of focus that initial step is on that skill. Absolutely. So we've got

139
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
the Mage's Ball Lightning here that now is just increasing its damage against stun enemies. It's

140
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
really that payoff for a lot of the lightning stun effects. And then Wizards Ball Lightning is just

141
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
always going to be generating more crack energy, just more consistent generation there.

142
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:27,000
All right, on to the next one. We've got some of the new uniques that we want to show off here on

143
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
the sort, talking about Ball Lightning. So this is actually something interesting we're doing this

144
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
season where we're making two uniques that are in the same slot. And they're going to modify the skill

145
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
in a different way. So they will be mutually exclusive. So you can take either this one here, which turns

146
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Ball Lightning into a kind of like a bowling ball, really. You send it forward, it goes pretty fast,

147
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and when it hits a target, it's going to explode and kind of splash outward. And I think this is

148
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
really cool. It offers a switched up play style to the way you're familiar with Ball Lightning, which

149
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
was kind of slow moving forward. Or if you pick the other unique, you can actually retain the old

150
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
gravitational aspect. So we can go on and take a look at that one here in the next clip.

151
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Right, so a lot of the Ball Lightning builds in the past were using the gravitational aspect that

152
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
caused it to rotate around you. And we've updated that and kind of reworked the gravitational aspect

153
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
so that now that functionality is built into this new unique and also has some additional bonuses

154
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
to encourage this kind of play style. And obviously the gravitational aspect that used to do this has

155
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
been reworked into a new cool effect that you'll be able to demo out on the PTR as well.

156
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This is like a fun trade-off now, sort of how you want to use Ball Lightning.

157
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah, it really helps it be a bit more build defining, which is our goal for a lot of the uniques is,

158
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
hey, you get this unique and it feels like it's very foundational to your build. One thing I do want to

159
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
call out here is the inherent affix on this right up near the top, that Ball Lightning can be cast

160
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
while moving. This makes it a lot smoother to just be moving around and just keep on clicking that Ball

161
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Lightning and you're not going to have to stop like that very short half-second stop to cast it. It just

162
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
feels much smoother and this is one that you really... this build just wants to be on the move.

163
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Right.

164
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And that encourages that.

165
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Alright, so let's talk about the Druid next. So this one,

166
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Druid is this season a lot of werewolf updates, you know, Season of the Werewolf. I absolutely love

167
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
werewolf builds and I think they've been, you know, maybe a little bit behind the rest of builds over

168
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
the course of Diablo's history and so this season a lot of our updates are really focused on building,

169
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
making that build come up to par.

170
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah, like pure werewolf, right?

171
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Pure werewolf.

172
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Not mixing it with other things.

173
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah, a lot of times you saw some like rapid shape-shifting builds and those are fun,

174
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
those are great, but you know, pure werewolf was really,

175
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
wasn't quite hitting the mark and so that's what a lot of our focus is.

176
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Let's take a look at some of these updates.

177
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So we've got updates to Shred, you know, the main core skill for these werewolf builds.

178
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Previously, the Raging Shred upgrade was just a combo attack that applied some poisoning damage.

179
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So now it's going to still do that and apply a lot more poisoning damage,

180
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
but it's also going to cause them to take even more poisoning damage for the next five seconds.

181
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So this is, you know, your kind of finishing move on your combo or your core combo,

182
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
but then it also enhances all the other poisoning damage that you applied through something like

183
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
rabies.

184
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Alright, we've got updates to Boulder.

185
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Now this isn't necessarily with the werewolf theme, but still,

186
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Boulder is a skill that we saw a good opportunity to improve on it.

187
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We had two upgrades on Boulder in the past, the kind of the two choices,

188
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and they were both fairly similar. They both dealt with critical strike chance or critical strike damage,

189
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and we thought that was an opportunity to rework one of them to give it a different identity.

190
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And basically the identity was Poison Boulder, like just a giant ball of poison.

191
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What does that look like or what does that do?

192
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Changing the damage type always helps sort of branch out and make it feel really different.

193
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, yeah, and we have some really sweet visuals for it too.

194
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm not sure if we have a video on that. I think we'll just have to rely on that in the PTR.

195
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah, people will see it on the PTR, but yeah, it's got some cool visuals associated with it.

196
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yeah, and so that one will be very cool. Definitely check that one out.

197
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
This one I'm very excited about because Blood Howl, as we see, has always just generated spirit, but now...

198
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah, yeah, it was always just generating some spirit, but you still do that,

199
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
but now it gives you even more increased damage until you shapeshift out of werewolf form.

200
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So going back to what Colin had mentioned about really focusing in on pure werewolf.

201
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That was an area that we felt, hey, we want to really reward you for staying in the werewolf form

202
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and really committing to that identity and just making sure that felt like an appropriate payoff,

203
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and this is one of the areas that we're doing that in.

204
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
All right, so let's talk a little bit about one of the updated legendaries.

205
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So the aspect of the blurred beast. So this previously was a legendary that just caused your shred to do some bonus damage to poison enemies.

206
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It was fine, but it wasn't too enticing. But now with the new update here, you actually still do more damage just all the time.

207
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And depending on how far you're traveling for shred, you're going to do some bonus hits.

208
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And it looks so cool. Your werewolf is dashing across the screen and then just doing this like multi-hit kind of attack.

209
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And so if you're really close, you're just going to get maybe one additional strike.

210
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But if you're at this further distance, as you see in this clip, you're going to get the full four hits.

211
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So it's really about positional gameplay a bit more than it was in the past, and you get very heavily rewarded for it when you do kind of execute that properly.

212
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That's awesome.

213
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And it's going to be really great for like movement, just moving around across the map, which I know movement is always a big thing that players really, really want.

214
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Some people have always been asking for. So it'll be cool to see people just kind of like just bouncing around as a druid with the aspect of the blurred beast.

215
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So very cool.

216
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah, it's always great where we can inject like changing how you play also, right?

217
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Because you can imagine like launching into a group of enemies, then picking out specific targets that you really want to launch to.

218
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And that's how you optimize that build combat-wise.

219
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah, absolutely.

220
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
This is one of my favorite ones in this patch, actually.

221
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Big fan of a lot of these druid updates.

222
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Aspect of Wolf's Reign.

223
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So this is a combo kind of legendary, combining the powers of Hurricane and your wolf companions.

224
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So when you cast Hurricane, all of your wolves actually spawn a little mini-hurricane of their own.

225
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And these will do bonus damage for each of your Act of the Wolves.

226
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So it really encourages these companion-based builds that already have this wolf pack of, you know, five wolves following them around.

227
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Now your hurricane affects all of them and, you know, they get bonus damage for how many you got.

228
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So you really want to be stacking up as many wolves as you can.

229
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
They all get hurricanes and you just get to shred through the whole screen with that.

230
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah, that's super cool.

231
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
All right, moving on to Rogue.

232
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So this is one that Shadow Clone has been probably the Rogue skill that I would say maybe wasn't quite hitting the mark compared to most other skills.

233
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And that was for a variety of reasons.

234
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And not to get too technical here on the details, but for a lot of the effects that you have with your legendaries and your passives and those kind of things, historically Shadow Clone behaved inconsistently with those.

235
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It wouldn't necessarily pick up all of the bonuses.

236
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It wouldn't trigger all of the effects.

237
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And the end result was basically that your Shadow Clone dealt a whole lot less damage than you did.

238
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You thought, hey, I'm hitting for, you know, millions and my Shadow Clone is hitting for like thousands, right?

239
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

240
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And so we really looked at that comprehensively and thought, okay, we need to kind of rethink how Shadow Clone works across the board to really bring it up to par to make it behave the way you expect.

241
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And then also extend that to a lot of the other summons in the game.

242
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The summons like your Necromancer skeletons, your Druid companions, and so on.

243
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So we did basically a rework of that entire system.

244
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And the long and short of it is that they should just work a whole lot better going forward in this season where they're going to trigger all of your lucky hit effects.

245
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
They're going to interact with all of your damage modifiers and multipliers that they previously were inconsistently working with.

246
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So just one example here, a very simple example.

247
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You've got Wind Strikers aspect.

248
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
This is a very simple legendary that just says, hey, when you critically strike, gain some movement speed.

249
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Now, in the past, that was only when you, your player character, critically strike with one of your skills.

250
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And it would not happen whenever one of your Druid companions or your Shadow Clone critically strikes.

251
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But now all of that will work.

252
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So your companions or your summons or your Shadow Clone critically strikes and you have Wind Strikers.

253
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Now your character gets that bonus.

254
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's huge.

255
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah, it's, I really can't, you know, overstate this.

256
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Like how many new interactions and synergies this unlocks with not just Shadow Clone, but all of the summons in general across the game.

257
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But with Shadow Clone in particular, we've got a new unique item.

258
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And this one is Assassin's Stride.

259
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And the effect here works with mobility skills and your Shadow Imbuement.

260
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Once again, kind of playing up that combo aspect.

261
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So all of your mobility skills are going to always be Shadow Imbued with some bonus potency.

262
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So they're going to do some more damage.

263
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And whenever you damage an elite or boss with a mobility skill, there's a chance to trigger an instant free Shadow Imbuement explosion.

264
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So those of you who like playing Shadow Step builds, one of my favorite ones with Rogue,

265
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you know, just like Adam had said before about jumping around the screen with werewolves, you can do that with Shadow Step now too.

266
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And you're just going to be getting a lot of those resets and kills much quicker as you leap out of the shadows,

267
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
trigger a Shadow Imbuement explosion, and then move on to the next pack of enemies.

268
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Really cool, unique for that kind of build.

269
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Additionally, Caltrops may be the skill that was the most kind of clunky and control-wise to use.

270
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Thank you.

271
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
God, seriously.

272
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:35,000
If you've ever tried to use Caltrops, it can be a struggle sometimes where your character would leap backwards and you wouldn't go in the right direction, wouldn't hit the enemies.

273
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:46,000
We've updated the animation here to just basically be very similar to the smoke grenade skill, where you just pick a point on the screen, your character throws it, and it just goes where you point it.

274
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I am the king of like Caltropping one minion out of like a hundred and then also falling, like jumping back into like a giant mob and going like, well, I didn't calculate that correctly.

275
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yeah.

276
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So this, that update, I've, we were talking about this beforehand, like before we even went live and I was like, thank, thank the effing God.

277
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I was like, oh my God, please.

278
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So yeah, it's, I'm excited for that.

279
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Caltrop should be so much more usable now and we think that this is a really good change going forward.

280
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah.

281
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
All right, onto the Necromancer.

282
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So Necromancer, we've done some improved itemization and updates to the overpower synergies, specifically the Rathma's Vigor key passive.

283
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So previously it would just give you some, an overpower once every 12 seconds and, or when you overhealed for some bonus life and now we're just tacking on a big chunk of overpower damage to it.

284
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So we definitely felt like these, these pure blood based overpower builds were just not quite hitting that mark.

285
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And, you know, just pumping the power into these pure builds through the Rathma's Vigor key passive, we think is going to be very helpful to make these builds really shine.

286
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
On to the next, we've got the, one of the new uniques.

287
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So similar to what we did with the Sorcerer where we had kind of these paired uniques, we're going to have two uniques in the same slot for Necromancer as well, this time in the pants slot.

288
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And they're both going to be working with Bloodwave.

289
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So this one, Kissimmee's Legacy, will cause, instead of shooting one Bloodwave out forward, you're going to get two that kind of converge on you.

290
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And this definitely changes up the targeting of it, the positioning requirements, and really the use case because it's pulling towards you instead of pushing away.

291
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So instead of being a defensive skill, it's much more about the damage and pulling them together.

292
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And then when they hit, they do a big chunk of damage as well.

293
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So definitely turns Bloodwave into a much more damage focused skill and a little bit less on the CC or the knockback, crowd control of it.

294
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah, and it plays super well with that key passive.

295
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Absolutely.

296
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Absolutely.

297
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Especially if you want to be using this for that big damage moment.

298
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Now the alternative is Indria's Memory, where it still shoots the Bloodwave forward, and then at the end of its path, it will trap the targets in a bone prison.

299
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So this is a unique that is very much about combining blood and bone.

300
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So a little bit less of the pure blood and much more about combining the two.

301
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Now additionally, you see we're using some bone spears here, or should I say blood spears, because that is what they now become.

302
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That's blood spears.

303
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And instead of costing a bunch of essence, they're going to cost, or sorry, they drain maximum life, still cost essence there.

304
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But they drain maximum life to cast additionally from a nearby corpse to fire an extra bone spear slash blood spear.

305
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So there's a lot going on with this one, but I think it really comes together to be a very strong build when you're using the bone spear and the blood wave.

306
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And then casting bone spear reduces blood waves.

307
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Cooldown, that's the inherent affix on these legs, really makes a really cool build that I think synergizes very nicely.

308
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Yeah, it's awesome.

309
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Alright, and so on to the Spiritborn.

310
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So we kind of, you know, warned at the start, you know, Spiritborn we recognize has been one or multiple steps above most other classes.

311
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And players have fun, people love playing the Spiritborn, very powerful.

312
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And we really like that.

313
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But we do have to recognize, you know, for the long term health of the game, it's important that we have a bit better class parity across the board.

314
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So you don't feel like you're doing it wrong if you're not playing a Spiritborn.

315
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah, and we have like a lot of the classes outside of the Spiritborn are actually in a really good spot.

316
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
They're pushing pit tier 100 plus, which is great.

317
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And again, we're not looking to really buff every class up to clearing pit 150 easily, right?

318
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We'd want to create that arms race where we just have to continuously sort of ask you, the player, to chew through, you know, 20 different torment tiers because we're just arms racing that power so much.

319
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah, we do think that kind of our target there is closer to where the other five classes are.

320
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And Spiritborn was just, you know, too high up.

321
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And it's rather than try to power creep the whole game, we'd like to make sure we make some small improvements everywhere else to the underperforming builds and those ones that don't have enough love and then get Spiritborn back down to a more healthy spot.

322
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And so with that in mind, one of the biggest offenders or biggest power points rather on the Spiritborn was the Rod of Kapoleki here.

323
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:35,000
This one is the one that converts your core skills into basic skills and does, it used to do reduced damage based on vigor cost.

324
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And admittedly, the calculations there were kind of complex.

325
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And so we've simplified it down a little bit where they will just gain the bonus critical strike damage.

326
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It will be substantially less.

327
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Previously it was 1 to 3%.

328
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Now it will be down to 0.1 to 0.5 per point of vigor there.

329
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We think this will bring it to a much healthier spot but still kind of retain the core fantasy and the core build implications of this item.

330
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
It just won't be pushing quite the same trillions of damage that we were seeing before.

331
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
We also fixed some of the issues called out here at the above like Viscous Shield and things like that.

332
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Scaling in unintended ways that were just way outside of our expectations.

333
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah, definitely some unintended kind of bugged interactions that were maybe double dipping or scaling too high.

334
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We've taken a pass to make those more in line with our expectations.

335
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
All right.

336
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Additionally, we've got, you know, new aspects.

337
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Of course, being a class in Diablo 4, you're going to be getting new content every season.

338
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,000
So we've got a new legendary aspect here, the aspect of endless talents that causes your razor wings to increase all of your Eagle skill damage.

339
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And razor wing critical strikes will grant even more stacks.

340
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So you can really stack that up.

341
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You know, it stacks up to 50%.

342
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That's a whole lot.

343
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So you really want to be spamming out these razor wings and getting those crits to stack this up as fast as possible.

344
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah.

345
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And this goes back to like just the prior slide where we talked about how razor wings and centipede builds are getting some extra love in this specific season,

346
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
which were more so underutilized in season six.

347
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So with season seven players, we'll see these new legendary aspects, of course, and then and how they actually tie back in with some of the changes that we're doing for those builds.

348
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Absolutely.

349
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
All right.

350
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And we've got some updates to some of the underused uniques as well.

351
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Ring of writhing moon here.

352
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
This one would trigger a pestilence swarm every 10 seconds.

353
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:42,000
We felt like that was a little too long given the pace of combat in our game and especially compared to some of the other options at the unique slot, the ring slot.

354
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So we've reduced that down to every four seconds.

355
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You'll spawn a pestilence swarm.

356
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And the vigor generated goes up from one up to three.

357
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So a lot more resource generation because your rings are often resource generated ones.

358
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So we want to make sure this is a compelling option compared to your other choices at the ring slot.

359
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
All right.

360
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So let's talk a little bit about some of the broader updates that affects all classes.

361
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So the one I'm excited about here is the ultimate updates.

362
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So in the previous season we introduced skill ranks on ultimates, right?

363
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So you can now rank up your ultimate up to rank five.

364
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And that was good.

365
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Gave you some cooldown reduction, some damage.

366
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But now when you actually fully invest in it up to that rank five, every ultimate in the game is going to get a new rank five bonus.

367
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So for example here on Lacerate, we've got at rank five Lacerate's damage is going to be increased by 40% of your critical strike damage bonus.

368
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It gives it this scaling factor.

369
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So you can see on the left Lacerate at rank one is doing about 38,000 damage.

370
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But you rank it up to five and it goes crazy high up to 119,000 damage because it's now getting that critical strike damage scaler.

371
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And so if you really want to build a dedicated Lacerate build as kind of your core damaging effect, this is going to be a great way to build around it and a good reward for investing all those extra skill points into it.

372
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Definitely.

373
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I love to see us add more things that incentivize you to actually put some points into skills.

374
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah.

375
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So often, you know, sometimes you'd see if you just wanted the access to the utility of the ultimate, hey, it's fine to put in one point, right?

376
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You get one point, you get the utility, maybe you get some buff from it.

377
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
But if you really want to invest in it, we want to make sure that that investment in those skill ranks feels meaningful.

378
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And we think these rank five bonuses on ultimates in particular is going to be a really good way to pay off those ultimate builds.

379
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Definitely.

380
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
All right.

381
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,000
We've also got some new generic legendary aspects to really support this style that talk directly to ultimate skills.

382
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So we've got the vehement brawlers aspect that causes casting an ultimate skill increases all of your damage output by 10 to 30% for 8 seconds.

383
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And you also gain additional skill ranks in your ultimate.

384
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So, hey, we just talked about skill rank bonuses.

385
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Now we've got, you know, a legendary that will give you some bonus skill ranks.

386
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Nice.

387
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:11,000
We've also got the Ring of Apogec Fervor, which says casting your ultimate skill will increase your damage by 8 to 18%, so a little bit less than the vehement brawlers.

388
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But it stacks up to 10 times, so you can get way more if you can cast your ultimate fast enough and kind of chain it together.

389
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So this will be really good for, like, rogues that use preparation to really get that ultimate cooldown reduction.

390
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And, or any build that really wants to focus around casting your alt many times in a row.

391
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
This one is going to be a great legendary for those style of builds.

392
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
All right.

393
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
We've also done some updates to the Rune Words.

394
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And so Rune Words, Vessel of Hatred feature, has been really well received.

395
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
We think that they've really, you know, spiced up some build variety.

396
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And we're going to add some new runes here and update some of the old ones.

397
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So all of the invocation runes have overflow.

398
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So the cost of, many of them have also been adjusted to allow you to proc this overflow effect when you generate more offering than needed much more often.

399
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And then also the ritual runes, the ones that, you know, generate the offering, some of them have been redesigned to have some larger potential moments of this overflow.

400
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So an example here on the seer rune, this generates a ton of offering, 300 offering at once.

401
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And you get that by casting five skills.

402
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,000
But then instead of just casting five skills and then generate all of it and then casting five again instantly,

403
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
we've added in this exhausted period for three seconds.

404
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So you can get that 300 offering at once, but then you've got to wait three seconds before you start building up those stacks again.

405
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah, it's like getting like large buckets every couple seconds instead of offering now with these.

406
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah, this is a good tuning knob to kind of make sure that, hey, we can give you the strong moment of power,

407
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
but then it is followed by a little bit of a weaker moment where you can't generate that.

408
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Rather than every rune always just being a steady amount, we like to have those peaks and valleys.

409
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I really think that leads to more interesting moments of the gameplay.

410
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, it's about potency versus frequency.

411
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Right.

412
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
So you get really strong effects, but you can't do it as often.

413
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Right.

414
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And that'll play right into the updates with a lot of the overflow to make sure that when you do overflow,

415
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
it feels really good and it feels really rewarding to get that.

416
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
So let's talk about some of the other runes.

417
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
We've got some new runes to show off.

418
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Yeah.

419
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So we've got three new rune words here.

420
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
The Nagu rune, a legendary rune that will gain 100 offering as long as you're maintaining a summon.

421
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And so as I kind of alluded to earlier with the shadow clone section, summon is our new catch-all term for anything that you summon.

422
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You know, it's pretty self-explanatory, but that includes things like necromancer minions, druid companions, sorcerer conjurations, rogue shadow clones,

423
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and even barbarian ancients from some of your effects.

424
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
That's awesome.

425
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Call of the Ancients and some of the legendaries that summon those.

426
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Those are all summons.

427
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Igni rune will generate 25 offering, but it stores up offering every 0.3 seconds.

428
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So you're actually doing about 75 offering per second, roughly.

429
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And you actually cash it in by casting a non-basic skill to get that offering.

430
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
So as long as you're out there kind of spamming your basic skill, you're going to be kind of banking up this offering.

431
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And then when you cast the non-basic, you cash it all in.

432
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
You probably trigger the rune it's connected to.

433
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
You get a big overflow.

434
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You get a big moment of power there.

435
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And finally, we've got the Chalk rune that generates, or requires 20 offering rather, and this will invoke druid's lightning bolt.

436
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:01,000
That's one of those, it's not the core skill, but lightning bolt is kind of that other power in the druid's kit, similar to like earthquake or stun grenades.

437
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah.

438
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah.

439
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So enable those kind of builds to really tap into that effect.

440
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Awesome.

441
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Lots of runes.

442
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Yeah.

443
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Lots of runes.

444
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Lots of changes coming to classes.

445
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
There's more changes in the notes that we'll have that we'll be hitting next week.

446
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So players can look into those.

447
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
These are just a few examples that we have for PTR.

448
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And of course, really need feedback on a lot of these changes.

449
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I know there's some people going in chat going like, hey, I'm noticing like, you know, maybe you're giving a lot of offering and then there's a little bit of a cool down period or something like that.

450
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Let us know.

451
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Let us know like we want people to try those out, like test it out so that we have the feedback so that before we go live with with patch two one, we can end up making any feedback changes based off of community feedback.

452
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So lots of cool stuff.

453
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Thank you so much for walking us through all the different class changes and everything like that, Charles.

454
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Do we have Dan available from Albany?

455
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
We do have Dan.

456
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I can hear you now.

457
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Oh, there we go.

458
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Dan was just like staring blankly at the camera and I was like, yes, I was.

459
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
But Dan is actually going to be talking about all the new content that's coming in patch two one with season seven.

460
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So Dan, do you want to take it away and talk to us a little bit about it?

461
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Absolutely.

462
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
A couple of technical difficulties could not keep me from sharing this with everybody.

463
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So this PTR for patch two one is a PTR of a couple firsts at this point.

464
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
This is going to be the first time that we're bringing the seasonal realm to a PTR.

465
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So what does this mean?

466
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:46,000
We've got a lot of seasonal content coming up in season seven and we want to be able to get all of your feedback on this content.

467
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It's pretty important for us to, you know, like Adam was saying, really have those iteration cycles where y'all are able to test and, you know, show what's working and what is it.

468
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,000
This is also going to be the first time since season two that we're bringing back seasonal character powers.

469
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So if you remember in season two season of blood, they were vampire powers and you slotted them into your sanguine circle.

470
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And so for season seven, it could be a little bit different, not vampires this time.

471
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
This time it's going to be witchcraft.

472
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And so I'm excited to really dig into that right now and tease out what y'all can play in a couple of weeks.

473
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So witchcraft is enables you as a practitioner to call upon the power of the swamp to do your bidding.

474
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And so you've met some witches before in the game and you're going to meet some more in the coming season.

475
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But before I really dive into witchcraft, we got to talk about your enemies.

476
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Now, your enemies of this season are going to be called the head rotten.

477
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Now, the head rotten are abominations that spawned from the tree of whispers and you're going to slay them and collect what we call restless rot.

478
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And this is going to be our currency for the season.

479
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Now, like I said, you know, the season is about witchcraft.

480
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So there are going to be some witches and those witches are going to be residing around the tree of whispers and they're going to have some altars.

481
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
And these altars are pretty important to you learning your witchcraft.

482
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And so you're going to travel to an altar.

483
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You're going to make an offering of restless rot.

484
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And that's going to enable you to to learn the witchcraft.

485
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Now, equipping witchcraft is going to be pretty simple.

486
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:52,000
You know, we wanted to take what was best from a lot of these styles of menus that we've done in the past and distill it into something that's very convenient and easy to use.

487
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And the result is this witchcraft menu that you can see in front of you.

488
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And so equipping is going to be super simple.

489
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You've got an inventory on the bottom and then you're going to drag or otherwise move that power to one of the slots up top.

490
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And you're going to have five normal slots, five normal powers you can equip at any point and one unique power for, you know, really special witchcraft that you can find.

491
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
The other thing is that you can upgrade your witchcraft directly in that inventory using restless rot.

492
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So again, we're streamlining the process to, you know, make it easy for players to equip and upgrade their witchcraft.

493
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Now, obviously, it wouldn't be a season without some rewards.

494
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And so let's talk about those a little bit.

495
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:47,000
This season we're going to have another reputation style gameplay in the form of Coven's Favor.

496
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Now, killing head rotten will get you headless rot or killing head rotten will get you restless rot.

497
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
But in order to advance the Coven's Favor, you actually need to complete whispers.

498
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And completing those whispers will increase your rank and allow you to unlock rewards, including items and materials and things like that.

499
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,000
In addition, new to this season, you're going to also unlock at certain ranks new witchcraft.

500
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And then you will have new things you can learn from those altars.

501
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And then because everyone loves it, we're bringing back the Resplendent Spark as well.

502
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So that's going to be at the end of your Coven's Favorite rank.

503
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And of course, the Resplendent Spark nowadays can be used from crafting, you know, a random mythic unique to actually targeting uniques using a lot of those runes that you can earn in the game.

504
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
All right.

505
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
One last little thing with respect to witchcraft.

506
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
So we wanted to try out something a little bit different.

507
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And so we've also created several powers that are lost to these witches, the Coven of the Swamp.

508
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And so those you can only find by traveling out in the world and discovering Forgotten Altars.

509
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And these Forgotten Altars will allow you to learn these lost powers.

510
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
And yeah, we just thought we'd try something a little bit different here.

511
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And yeah, let us know what you think about it.

512
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Now, let's talk about some of the witchcraft itself.

513
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
You know, we've talked it up a bit.

514
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
We're going to release its over 20 powers for the season.

515
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And we're going to show you four of those right now.

516
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So let's talk about the first one.

517
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
This one's really popular.

518
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
This is the Poison Frog.

519
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So the Poison Frog, as you imagine, is a servant that you can summon that fights alongside you.

520
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
As its name implies, it will poison your enemies.

521
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And, you know, if it runs out of health, it's going to explode viciously with a lot of poison damage.

522
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Folks are having a lot of fun with this one.

523
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Next up.

524
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Next up is Doom Orb.

525
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So Doom Orb is a pure orb of Eldritch Energy that circles around you and damages any enemy it touches.

526
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And it can also launch itself at distant enemies before returning.

527
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Also another favorite at this point.

528
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Vengeful Servant.

529
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So Vengeful Servant, as the name implies, is another servant like the Frog.

530
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And this one will absorb damage and then rush enemies.

531
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And then last but not least, we've got one of those lost witchcraft powers I was telling you about.

532
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And this is Pironado.

533
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So this one procs when you cast other powers.

534
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And so if you cast a Hex and an Aura at the same time and inflict it upon an enemy, there's a chance that you will then proc the Pironado.

535
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And the Pironado, as you can see, sucks everything into it in a swirling dervish of fish and destruction.

536
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So, yeah, that's a peek at some of the witchcraft powers you're going to be able to play with soon.

537
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:11,000
But what good are powers if we aren't offering you some new activities within the season to participate in?

538
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And so these come in the form of head hunts.

539
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Now, head hunts are a whisper-driven activity.

540
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
And so the tree is searching for these head rotten.

541
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
The tree wants you to eliminate these head rotten.

542
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And so it's going to help you by highlighting areas within the world where it thinks there's a lot of head rotten for you to kill.

543
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So you're going to follow the whispers in order to, you know, find the head hunts and kill the head rotten.

544
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Now, these are subzone takeovers, similar to Helltides.

545
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
They're going to feature a number of all new whispers mixed in with some existing ones.

546
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:00,000
This is an opportunity for our team to try out some new whispers and really kind of tell a little bit of a story each time you're going out on a head hunt,

547
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
because whispers offer us that opportunity.

548
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Now, completing whispers has a chance of spawning a head rotten boss.

549
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And the head rotten bosses are the things you're really going to be looking out for,

550
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
because those are going to give you some additional rewards I'm going to tell you about.

551
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Delivering a head rotten bosses head to the tree of whispers enables you to earn occult gems.

552
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Let's talk about occult gems.

553
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Now, we're pretty excited about these.

554
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Occult gems are special socketables that have unique effects that help you fine tune your build.

555
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So they can only be slotted in the jewelry slot.

556
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And so this is a way of basically having them coexist with runes.

557
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And they only last for the season.

558
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So when your items transfer to the eternal realm at the end of the season, these are going to disappear.

559
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
But in the meantime, I think you're going to have a lot of fun with them.

560
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Let's dive into them a little bit.

561
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So each occult gem has built in defense.

562
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We don't want you to have to make a choice between, you know, a royal diamond or a royal skull and an occult gem.

563
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:22,000
So all of these occult gems have defense built into them so that, you know, really you're getting a bonus above and beyond, you know, those gems that I just described.

564
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And so here are some examples of them.

565
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
First up, we've got the Elder Sigil.

566
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
This is going to boost your damage whenever you hex enemies.

567
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So if you're leaning into certain types of hexes you like using, Elder Sigil may be a good fit for you.

568
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Killing Wind.

569
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:48,000
This is going to boost your crit and move for folks who really dig, you know, specking out with Eldritch powers.

570
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:56,000
So if you equip three or more Eldritch powers, then slotting a Killing Wind into, say, one of your rings might benefit you quite a bit.

571
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
And then finally, we've got Deathstone.

572
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
This is a legendary one.

573
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So it's going to be even more powerful than the other two I talked about.

574
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:11,000
This is going to boost when you use hex and aura and afflict other enemies with those.

575
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:21,000
So each time you do that, not only do you have a chance to proc that Puran Edo I talked about before, but you're going to increase the damage that you output per affliction.

576
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:31,000
So you can kind of get a sense that the occult gems are providing you even more incentives for, you know, creating a certain type of build.

577
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And, you know, we are just really excited to see what kind of combinations you all come up with.

578
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I think, yeah, it's going to be pretty exciting.

579
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So final thing is, you know, we were doing a lot with the Tree of Whispers.

580
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
We've got the witches around them, you know.

581
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So we thought, well, we should, you know, take some of the quality of life feedback we've heard from players and try and address it.

582
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So the first thing we've done is we've updated the town around the Tree of Whispers.

583
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
We added some more services to it because we expect you to be returning to it a lot more this season.

584
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And we've changed the layout a little bit to make it a little more convenient to navigate and move the waypoint so that it's just quicker to get to the Tree of Whispers to turn in things.

585
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But sometimes, you know, you're in the middle of a headhunt we found and you're getting a lot of grim favor, but you don't want to leave.

586
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You want to try and go fight the boss that you just summoned, right?

587
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So we've also implemented what we call the Raven of the Tree.

588
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And the Raven of the Tree appears in every headhunt zone.

589
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And that allows you to turn in your grim favor on the spot so that you don't have to go back to the tree town.

590
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Now, you're not going to have access to all those other services. So, you know, you hit your inventory limit, you'll probably want to go back to town.

591
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But in the moment, when you're in a flow, you can go to the Raven of the Tree, get your cache and then keep fighting.

592
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And then finally, we felt like we wanted to expand the rewards a little bit more for the Tree of Whispers.

593
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So we've added ancestral caches. It's a pretty low probability of getting one, but they're there.

594
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And these guarantee you getting an ancestral item from a cache.

595
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So obviously you see this pop up. I have a feeling you're probably going to select it.

596
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:25,000
So, yeah, I think that's all I have to talk about for the upcoming PTR.

597
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So I'll kick it back over to you, Adam.

598
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Awesome. Thank you so much, Dan.

599
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Talking about a ton of new stuff coming for Patch 2.1 PTR and of course Season 7.

600
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I'm super excited for all the Tree of Whisper updates.

601
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I know a lot of people in chat are, especially with the Raven not having to go back to the Tree of Whispers every single time.

602
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Being able to turn in Grim Favors right there through the Raven.

603
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
On top of that, also just the rework of the zone.

604
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So everything's a little bit closer.

605
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
You're going to have to walk all the way across to walk all the way back to the waypoint or to get to the vendors and everything.

606
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So there's a lot of big changes with that.

607
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And please do choose the ancestral cache if you get that.

608
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It's like, why would you not?

609
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I do not.

610
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And I think it's important to remember we added the ability to favorite waypoints as part of Season 6 or the last patch that we did.

611
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So it's super helpful with that witch tone.

612
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah, most definitely.

613
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And of course, you know, people have been seeing some of the new witchcraft powers and noticing some familiarities of past Diablo lore.

614
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And I will say we'll be talking more about the story of Season 7 as we get closer to launch.

615
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So players can hear more about kind of like the origins of what we've been kind of talking about here with this story with Diablo 4.

616
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So thank you again, Dan, for walking us through all the content that's coming with Season 7.

617
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And of course, last but not least, we do want to talk about some big quality of life changes.

618
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
One really, really big one that we're really excited to talk about.

619
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
And Mr. Colin Feiner will talk and walk us through everything.

620
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Yeah, thanks, Adam.

621
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
So most of these are sort of systemic updates, so I'll talk through them.

622
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Paragon migration is more just a reminder on how the new Paragon system works.

623
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:13,000
All of the Paragon experience that you've earned in a Season is actually at the end of Season 6 going to be added to your Eternal Realm Paragon.

624
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So what that means is, you know, if you're Paragon level 230 on a Season,

625
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
all of that 230 worth of experience is going to get added to your Eternal,

626
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
which probably is going to level up your Eternal Paragon.

627
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And I mention this because we added the really cool soul stone.

628
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I kept calling it the Vessel of Hatred Crystal, but that's the soul stone.

629
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
That really cool soul stone that you get at Paragon level 300, you can actually earn that on Eternal.

630
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So if you're not willing to sort of put in hundreds of hours to get that in a Season,

631
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
you can work your way there on the Eternal Realm as you sort of cash in these Seasons.

632
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
So we think that's going to feel pretty good.

633
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Yeah, it's going to be really nice as you're playing through multiple Seasonal characters,

634
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
and then eventually you'll end up just getting enough XP to actually earn those rewards at level 300 Paragon.

635
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So that's actually, it's not like, I have to have it in this Season or something like that.

636
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
You know, you probably end up getting it in a couple of Seasons if you play pretty extensively and you level up your Paragon.

637
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah, definitely.

638
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
The second one here is now we are essentially tying the unique powers.

639
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So if you think about like the Fists of Fate, that random damage rule from 1 to 200, that's going to be tied,

640
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
the floor is going to be tied to the amount of greater affixes that are on that item.

641
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
So if you have one greater affix, the floor is going to go up a little bit from the 1%.

642
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
When you get four greater affixes, it's going to go up quite a bit.

643
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It's not exactly perfect because we wanted to maintain the sort of specialness of a 4GA with a perfect unique roll.

644
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,000
We've seen some of those on Reddit and I think it's always such a cool moment to sort of see those drop.

645
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
But it's going to be a substantial increase to the power of the floor.

646
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,000
So it's going to be nearly impossible to get a 4GA with a really crappy unique power roll.

647
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah.

648
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It's always great getting a 4GA and then like rolling it.

649
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
1%!

650
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Yeah.

651
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Yeah.

652
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
That always just feels bad.

653
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You never want to be comparing like, oh, I got a 4GA.

654
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Well, my 1GA one is maybe better because it has a better unique roll.

655
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
That wasn't a moment we felt was really enticing.

656
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So we wanted to make sure that the more GAs you get, just the better the item is.

657
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Comprehensively, just better.

658
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah, absolutely.

659
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So that should help quite a bit.

660
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And then I'm going to talk about one thing previously on that, which is Ancestral Legendaries.

661
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
They are now going to, when an Ancestral item drops, it's going to drop the top end of the Legendary Aspect roll.

662
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,000
So if you think in Season 6 we added 5 more ranks to compensate Ancestral being added,

663
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Rank 21 is usually where they end up landing.

664
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Now Ancestral items, when they drop, they're going to be at the top end of that.

665
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So you should always be pretty excited when an Ancestral drops because it's always the best.

666
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Sort of top end ranks of that Legendary Power that could drop.

667
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Yeah, we saw lots of conspiracy theories on Reddit.

668
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
People going like, hey, I think my Codex of Power is not getting updated correctly or something like that.

669
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And we totally understand.

670
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
There was a lot of confusion behind it.

671
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
We admit that on our end.

672
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And this just makes it easier and better for players in being able to grab it.

673
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It's not Colin behind the scenes on a computer.

674
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It was.

675
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It was.

676
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It actually was.

677
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
He was literally just making sure you got the lowest aspect rolls or anything like that.

678
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Yeah.

679
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Grind harder.

680
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Yeah.

681
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:23,000
So that most definitely will address a lot of the confusion there as well as just make it better for players in Varel.

682
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Yeah, definitely.

683
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And then the second point here is we've pretty substantially increased the Ancestral drop rate across the board.

684
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:39,000
They're not going to be raining from the sky, but it's definitely a pretty substantial increase that we think is just going to level up all the different activities in the game and that should just feel a lot better.

685
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:46,000
We don't want to go too far where they're no longer special, but we thought that we were a little bit too conservative on our first swing.

686
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
And this will affect all Torment tiers, right?

687
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
That's right.

688
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Not just Torment 4?

689
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Yep, exactly.

690
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
So all Torment tiers are going to get this increase.

691
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Great.

692
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And then the next one.

693
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So we saw that gems were dropping a little too frequently, constantly getting stuck on the ground and players were capped on them.

694
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So we are doing a pass to reduce them overall, but to compensate, we're actually adding a sink for them.

695
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So you're going to be able to take gem fragments and craft random legendary amulets and random legendary rings.

696
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Those all obviously have a chance to be ancestral once you get into the Torment.

697
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So it's a really nice way for us to sort of make sure that you're never hitting a point where you just have so many gem fragments.

698
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
They're worthless, right?

699
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Awesome.

700
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Yeah.

701
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And then the next one I think is going to be, I'm super excited about, and that's Class Quest Updates.

702
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
They're going to work similar to Altars of Lilith, right?

703
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Do you have more details on that?

704
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah.

705
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
So Class Quest, so every class has this special mechanic.

706
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So like on Sorceress, you've got your enchantment slots.

707
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And in the past, when you hit level 15, you'd get a quest where you had to go and help out a mage to find a lost home.

708
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So for players who have already completed that, you are going to, if you, you do need to log into that character first to kind of unlock it across your account.

709
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:11,000
But once you've done that, any subsequent Sorceress that you make, once you hit level 15, you're going to immediately unlock that first enchantment slot.

710
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And then once you hit level 30, you'll unlock the second one.

711
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Now for every class, the exact level is going to be different.

712
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
It depends on when that would normally unlock.

713
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
But you won't have to go through the whole quest line to do so.

714
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
But for those of you who really enjoyed doing those quests, there will be a pretty juicy reward if you do choose to do it.

715
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
But you're going to get that mechanic right off the bat.

716
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
That's awesome.

717
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And you could still just log into your seasonal character and do it to unlock the class mechanic.

718
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Of course.

719
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Not, we don't require you to log into your eternal character to get those.

720
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Cool.

721
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
So I think that's going to be awesome.

722
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I always like check the time like, oh, I'm level 40.

723
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I should probably go do my class quest.

724
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I have definitely forgotten to unlock my golem on my Necromancers for a little longer than I would like to admit.

725
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Well, production spoiled it.

726
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
As they raise their hands up in the air.

727
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
But the next update is obviously a big one.

728
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Which is, finally, we don't have to say this is in development still.

729
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Armory.

730
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Armory is coming with Season 7 patch 2.1.

731
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
So, Colin, want to go through it all?

732
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Absolutely, yeah.

733
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
This one was a really niche request.

734
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
We had to dive super deep into the forum.

735
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Yeah.

736
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So, that one guy who asked for this, this is for you.

737
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm just kidding.

738
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
This has been a super hot requested feature.

739
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
We're excited to bring it to everybody.

740
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
So, everybody's going to get this update.

741
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Armory is going to allow you to save builds.

742
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
It's going to save all your equipment, all of your skills, all of your paragon, all of your paragon glyphs.

743
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You can even name it.

744
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And what this really allows you to do is be a lot more flexible in the end game, right?

745
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So, if you're really liking your fireball build, but you've got this really sweet ball lightning unique.

746
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Oh.

747
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Now, it's really easy to just save off that fireball build if you ever want to come back to it.

748
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And you can start building out that ball lightning build.

749
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
So, we're really excited about this.

750
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And we're not going to charge you for respec-ing or anything like that.

751
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So, you save it.

752
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
It's yours.

753
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's even come with some cool quality of life things where we actually mark all of the equipment that's actually part of an armory slot.

754
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And that's really important to know because we're just saving the equipment, right?

755
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah.

756
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So, you'll want to know if you're going to modify this item that it would affect any of the loadouts that are currently using this item.

757
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Yeah.

758
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
If you take a legendary and say change the imprinted aspect on it, you know, it's still part of that build.

759
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
So, it might not be the right one.

760
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yeah.

761
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So, you do probably want to get, you know, multiple sets of gear if you want to be building this up.

762
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But it's so much easier to swap between them.

763
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,000
So much easier to explore all of the new build possibilities that we introduce every season with the new items and updates.

764
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Absolutely.

765
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And it's in all the main towns.

766
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
It's even in the training rooms, which is very nice.

767
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And it's important to note that we will swap it from anywhere.

768
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
So, if the equipment is in your stash or if it's in your inventory, you don't have to worry about it.

769
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
We'll just swap it out for you.

770
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Yeah.

771
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It'll just all...

772
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
It automagically does it, which is really nice.

773
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Absolutely.

774
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
It makes it as easy as possible for players to be able to really utilize the feature, which I think is great.

775
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Cool.

776
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So, yeah, we're super excited.

777
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
We're really leaning into the flexibility.

778
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
That's why we've just removed a lot of the cost to switch around.

779
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:12,000
And we think this should open up, you know, if you're playing a Druid, you don't have to go make another Druid or go through 300 clicks to change out your Paragon.

780
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Yeah.

781
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And I think one thing I do want to note is because this will be in PTR.

782
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
We really need people to actually test it.

783
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's a brand new feature.

784
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
There's a lot of complexities behind it.

785
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Obviously, it's pulling things from your stash, pulling things from other inventories, etc.

786
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So, I want to make sure that players actually do get an opportunity to actually test it during PTR.

787
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Give us feedback.

788
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's something that we're going to continuously iterate.

789
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
One thing I do want to call out is in PTR, it won't have controller support.

790
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It will have controller support when we do launch it with patch 2.1, the final patch itself.

791
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
But for the PTR, it won't actually be, there won't be controller support on it.

792
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So, I just want to caveat that now for players that are actually going to, that do play on controller to note that it won't be there for that specifically.

793
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So, tons of changes coming for Season 7.

794
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Obviously, all the class changes, the ultimate changes that Charles talked about, the balance and items are related to that.

795
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
New rune words, reworked rune words as well.

796
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,000
We have, of course, all the Season 7 stuff that Dan talked about with the Witchcraft powers and, of course, our new gems, the occult gems.

797
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So, we want players to actually jump in and try those out and with all the quality of life fixes that we do have.

798
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
So, I know we do want to jump into Q&A before we...

799
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Oh, PTR updates. I forgot.

800
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Sorry, I forgot about PTR updates.

801
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I can't even follow my own agenda that's like sitting here on a piece of paper, Adam.

802
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:51,000
But, we do actually do have some PTR updates really quickly that I do want to talk about because, as you guys remember, the with 2.1, the prior PTRs, we did character copies before, account copies from your main accounts.

803
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Things are going to be a little different for patch 2.1.

804
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
This is way better for players.

805
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:04,000
If you guys remember back with even the patch 2.0 PTR, we actually did an account copy and it was like weeks and weeks in advance and people were like,

806
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
whoa, this is like my barb from like, you know, it feels like yesteryear or something like that.

807
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
50 years ago. Yeah.

808
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Now, we are giving the flexibility of players being able to account copy on demand, essentially, for PTR.

809
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:26,000
So, with patch 2.1 PTR, there will be a kind of a new button on the UI where you'll be able to actually account copy over to your PTR account.

810
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
So, take all your characters from your normal account and move them over.

811
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,000
There are a few caveats we do want to mention though, is that it does replace everything once you do that.

812
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And you can do it multiple times, but each time you do that, it does replace it all.

813
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:50,000
So, if you do bounce between, you know, PTR and like your main account on the normal game servers, just, and let's say you get new gear, you can move those things over.

814
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Just note, it's going to wipe everything on your PTR when you do do that.

815
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:10,000
If you also utilize the, let's say you don't actually utilize the account copy over and you actually use the account boosts or the character boosts that we actually have within PTR, just note that if you do account copy over afterwards, it will also replace those.

816
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
So, just be careful with that.

817
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
We'll make sure to note that all in the blog so players are aware.

818
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:23,000
But it is just a caveat that we do want to mention for players, but it does allow for way more flexibility of being able to carry that stuff over.

819
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Definitely.

820
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
There we go.

821
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
But new additions for the boosts that we have for PTR.

822
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Obviously, we'll end up having the new unique items within the character boosts that will be available in Season 7 PTR.

823
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,000
We'll have, you know, Witchcraft powers, the Witchcraft progression items that we had talked about earlier as well.

824
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
So, those will be all part of the PTR boost.

825
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,000
So, it gives you guys the tools of being able to test everything and getting us feedback for anything that you guys want to change.

826
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Before the Season 7 and Patch 2.1 actually kicks off.

827
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Cool.

828
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Now, we can go into Q&A.

829
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I do want to call out quickly just a reminder that we will have a blog up immediately after the stream for PTR.

830
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Patch notes will be next Wednesday.

831
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Again, this is due to us streaming a little early for the holidays just to make sure that everyone was here to do a stream for PTR.

832
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And then PTR is planning on starting on December 3rd.

833
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
So, players will be able to jump into PTR then.

834
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Of course, it is just PC Battle.net, just easier for us and more flexibility for us to be able to do updates and everything from our end for PTR.

835
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
But, I know we have a question teed up.

836
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So, if you have questions, please put them in chat.

837
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And we will get those, you know, we will try to address as many as possible for the end of the stream.

838
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I have to like reach over.

839
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
There is like a plant here that no one can see.

840
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
But, will all the PTR content be available on day one?

841
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Is a question that we probably, we've heard when we announce a PTR stream.

842
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And we know that players are probably going to ask just because with the past PTR, you know, we had.

843
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
We split it out.

844
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Yeah, we did split it out.

845
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
We will say that all the PTR content will be available day one.

846
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:17,000
So, players can jump in and actually check out everything related to patch 2.1 immediately with day one whenever they need to.

847
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
So, shouldn't be a problem.

848
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Jumping into some questions.

849
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Small petting zoo.

850
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I know small petting zoo.

851
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
They are a person that plays a lot of companion druid.

852
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I would imagine based on the name.

853
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So, they are asking, will there be fixes to storm and werewolf tags given to druid wolves by the item Storm's Companion?

854
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Yes.

855
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
They have never functioned, would more than double the damage of the build.

856
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Yes, actually as part of that comprehensive update that I mentioned to summons across the game.

857
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I did take a pass to look at specifically updating how the wolves interact with Storm's Companion.

858
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:57,000
And now, whenever they are imbued with a lightning from Storm's Companion, they do count as lightning skills.

859
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And because the, you know, not to get too technical, but because the way the damage is calculated and attributed, it should also work with all the things that say, hey, when you deal lightning damage, do something special.

860
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Your lightning wolves are going to be triggering and interacting with all those effects.

861
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
It should be, it should work in every way that you're expecting to going forward.

862
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Awesome.

863
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Shockey pets.

864
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Question from NarratorDog.

865
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
How does this fit into, how does the Season 7 stuff fit into lore?

866
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Because during Vessel of Hatred and the tree seemed to be on good terms.

867
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Dan, I don't know if you want to answer this or if you want me to answer it, up to you.

868
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Yeah, so I'll say, first off, we're not going to get too deep of an answer.

869
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:50,000
We're going to reveal more about the story as we get closer to the release of Season 7.

870
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:00,000
That said, we are really looking at trying to build upon the events of Vessel of Hatred with every season moving forward.

871
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
And so you'll start seeing changes in the world as we do that.

872
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
And I'll leave it at that.

873
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Cool.

874
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
You'll hear more soon.

875
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Again, we plan on doing a more grandiose reveal of Season 7 content and the story as we get closer to the release.

876
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So you'll hear more about kind of like the backstory of everything and how the Tree of Whispers plays into everything as well.

877
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Question from Toothless81.

878
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Is there going to be a rework or cost reduction to masterworking?

879
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Veiled Crystals have become a huge roadblock with trying to gear multiple alts.

880
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Yeah, I think we are always keeping our eye on the economy.

881
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
We did a big pass.

882
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
If you remember, we did a stream last week that was talking about tightening up the economy.

883
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So we do intend on taking a look at just generally how things are playing out.

884
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I think alts is something that we need to definitely be taking a look at.

885
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
We do want to encourage alt gameplay.

886
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
That was part of the big Paragon changes.

887
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So that sort of feedback is super valuable.

888
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
It's really good to know that Veiled Crystals are that alt blocker.

889
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,000
We want to make sure that alts are something that players are really excited about if that's something that they want to pursue.

890
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
So I appreciate that.

891
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Question related to like stacking items.

892
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
This is from Marwan Gaming.

893
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Any plans on the amount that you can stack like items, potions, light, potions, keys and runes?

894
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Wow, I can't read.

895
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Any updates or are we looking at any of that type of thing?

896
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
We definitely are looking at it.

897
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
We don't have anything to share, but it's top of mind.

898
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I know that boss materials, for example, are at 50.

899
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
There are some technical reasons why we have it like that, but it's something we are actively looking at.

900
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Dracronia mentions, do you know if XP wells are getting fixed?

901
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,000
And do you know if there's an opportunity for maybe pets collecting loot a little bit faster?

902
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Anything on the screen for players?

903
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I know that XP well definitely has been reported and it's something we're looking into.

904
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So we know about it.

905
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
We're looking at it.

906
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
This is part of the PTR is to find a lot more of these types of problems.

907
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
So we will look at it.

908
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
As far as the pets, no plans at the moment.

909
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I know we've done a big pass on a lot of things to essentially make sure that like when a rare item drops in Torment, it's just going to get auto salvage.

910
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,000
So we do try and essentially make a lot more of the loot just auto pick up a bull.

911
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Question from Mags PVE.

912
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Will Druid ever see some love for Ravens?

913
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I think Ravens would be awesome to have maybe a different companion outside of like the wolves and everything that they have right now or the vines and stuff.

914
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Is there any plans for maybe adjustments to Ravens in the future?

915
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Absolutely.

916
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Ravens, one of the three companions compared to the wolves and the vine creeper which I think are often a bit more of the marquee ones in the companion builds, at least as they currently are.

917
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:12,000
That's something we're definitely aware of and going forward, you know, when we look to make new effects for these companion builds, I think Ravens might be, you know, maybe the next one we start looking at.

918
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Nothing I can commit to firmly at this point.

919
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
But it's definitely something that we have noticed and yeah, it's something we'll keep in mind.

920
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Yeah, I appreciate that.

921
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Part of that summoning tag update was really to sort of give us more tools to do things like improve the Raven experience or the Call of the Ancients experience.

922
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Yeah, yeah. I think that summon update is going to be really huge for companion druids and every other build that uses these.

923
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And we'll definitely, you know, look at it under that new lens after this update and see where we can make further improvements.

924
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
We'll do one last question, but this is like a two-parter question from two different people.

925
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:56,000
One's from TeampoDiablo4, the other one's from Dejal22, and they're both related to Armory.

926
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Will items in the Armory be locked from accidentally selling them?

927
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And separately, will saved items for Armory builds have like maybe an icon or something associated to them to kind of like call them out that they are part of a saved build?

928
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Yeah, so when you do save a loadout, we favorite all of those items. So just automatically that happens.

929
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
No, no mistaken like, oh crap.

930
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah, you'd have to unfavorite it, then sell it. And then at that point, it's like, well, it's sort of on you.

931
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And then the second part is, yes, there is a little icon that does indicate that, hey, this is part of an Armory.

932
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Cool. So yeah, you know that like, hey, this is part of a build. Don't mess with it.

933
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Don't accidentally unfavorite it or anything like that, which is good to know. So cool.

934
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Well, we again, thank you guys for tuning in for our Patch 2.1 PTR stream.

935
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I know there's a lot of news coming down the line for Diablo 4 as we get closer to 2.1.

936
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
But we do have a blog that will be going live this afternoon, probably right after this stream.

937
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And again, our patch notes, the full patch notes for this PTR will be next Wednesday.

938
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
So it's a little bit of a delay, mainly due to the holidays and us doing the stream a little bit early.

939
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Normally, we have the patch notes immediately after the stream.

940
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So there's going to be way more content beyond what we just talked about here in those patch notes for people to actually check out.

941
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,000
And of course, Patch 2.1 PTR is launching on December 3rd for PC Battle.net users.

942
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So really looking forward to people jumping in, trying everything that we talked about today, including the new features, including the Armory,

943
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:37,000
including all the Season 7 stuff with Witchcraft powers and occult gems that we actually heard from Dan as well.

944
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
So huge thanks to Dan out in Albany. And of course, thank you, Colin.

945
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Thank you, Charles, for talking us through all the content that's going to be coming with Patch 2.1 PTR.

946
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And yeah, we'll see you guys probably after the holidays, but we'll see you in the PTR for sure.

947
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
And we'll check you guys out in Hantu. See you guys. Thanks.

948
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Thanks.

949
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Thanks, Sal.

950
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Thanks.

951
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Thanks.

952
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Thanks.

953
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Thanks.

954
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Thanks.

955
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Thanks.

956
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Thanks.
