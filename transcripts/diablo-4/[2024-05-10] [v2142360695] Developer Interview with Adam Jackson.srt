1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are here with the boy Adam Jackson.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you for coming on, Adam.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
How are you doing today?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, I'm doing great.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How are you guys doing?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Doing pretty good.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Fantastic.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Excited.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The interview questions are going to start because I know we're a little early.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're about four minutes and it's early, so we're just going to have a couple minute intro

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
while the people row in here.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It will be starting at exactly 1 p.m. PST.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But outside of that, how has the day been for you?

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Very easy icebreaker, so we would waste the three minutes before we get going.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, totally.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's been wild.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We've got so much stuff going on between working on season four, more seasons and things coming

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
up in the future.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Lots of planning, lots of talks.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The season's going to be coming out soon.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I expect a whole lot of feedback and reaction to that, so it's a busy time over here, but

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
pretty exciting as well.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Nice, man.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It sounds like you guys are going to have a pretty interesting launch because season four

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
is coming out here very shortly, and I think itemization is going to be the big talk.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We do have some questions related to both itemization, what's going to be next, etc.,

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
for you to go through here on the list.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Before we get started, we have to do a quick thing and make sure everyone here can hear

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
the audio just fine.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Can you hear Ghazi?

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, Ghazi, can you say a sentence?

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I can say a sentence.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Absolutely.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Super excited for the release.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Minions.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's all I'm saying.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And Adam, literally anything at all you want to say?

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Test, test.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I also am a minion enjoyer, it turns out.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So, I've heard.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm excited to talk about him.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't know.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't get Ghazi started on minions when we get going, man.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We've spent like the last few days, so I've told DM, you got to make sure that I don't

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
go off on a rant here because we're going to spend the next 45 minutes on that topic.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, we've done our best to make sure we don't get stuck there.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm trying to keep him on a leash from the whole thing being a necromancer interview,

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but we'll do what we have to do.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I get it.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Everyone has their thing.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Some people look like Druid Wolves.

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Some people look like Necromanion.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Some people look like Breaking the Game with Barb permanently.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Everybody's got their thing.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
All right.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So, with that being said, I think we've stalled enough to let the people roll in.

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you're not here by now, we're just going to get going.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We kind of had just, we're wasting a minute or two because we're a couple minutes early.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But with that being said, thank you, everyone, for joining across the different livestream

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
platforms for this interview with Blizzard's own Adam Jackson.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Before we get going, you wanted to say who you are, what your job is over there for the

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
people that, for some reason, don't happen to know.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, totally.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, hi, everybody.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My name is Adam Jackson.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm the lead class designer, specifically on the live classes team.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, our group handles a lot of the update, pretty much all the balance updates that you

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
see going into the game for classes.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We also are heavily involved in systems and the stuff that you see, really, in seasonal

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and expansion releases that have to do with the things that you farm and why and the classes

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
themselves and the new Legendary's uniques going in, that kind of stuff.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And Ghazi, introduce yourself for the people that don't know.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Minion Andy, I guess, is the easiest way to describe it.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I do mostly rethink guys' classes for ARPG games, mostly for Path of Exile Diablo 4,

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Lost Epoch, recently. Just a hard minion to enjoy.

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't get enough of it.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Minion Andy Ghazi. And then, of course, I'm DM.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And with that being said, we're going to get going.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So, thank you, first of all, for joining us for the interview.

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It is now 1 p.m. PST.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We're going to start with our first question.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So, right out of the get-go, we have some questions.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hopefully, we can get to all of them.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If we don't, it's all good.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We're going to start with the first one here, which is,

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
with the recent focus of gameplay being post-100, the 1 to 50 process,

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
a little faster than it used to be on launch, right?

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What are the team's thoughts on progressing the Paragon system?

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
An example being like new Paragon boards, etc.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, I think there's definitely room, I believe.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And this is, like, my personal opinion talking here.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But I think that there's definitely room to make Paragon more interesting.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Adding new boards and things is always on the table.

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That is something that we can do.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And probably is something that we will do.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But the way that we kind of think of Paragon is that it's kind of your one-stop shop

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
where we try to make stats cool, right?

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Like, why you care about strength, why you care about whatever stats you're chasing.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Like, it's one of those places where we try to make it a little bit more interesting and robust.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think we did a decent job at the launch game with Paragon,

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
but I think that there's more that we could add to the depth of the system

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
to make it just more appealing.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You know, we did a little bit of that in Season 2, if you remember.

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We started adding scaling mechanics where we turned some of your stats

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that are always additive into multiplicative scaling stats,

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
like usually in Legendary Paragon nodes and other places.

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But that's kind of a little bit of experimentation in that regard.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I would expect that we do more in the future.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Of course, nothing to announce, but that's kind of how we're thinking about it right now,

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
is that it's cool.

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We think there's more opportunity to do cool things there.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Something simple like adding new boards, yeah.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't think there's really a high risk there,

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and it's something that I could totally see us doing.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm curious to the idea of the further development of the Paragon system,

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
because I know in the interview you had with Rax,

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the question regarding the skill tree was that the idea was to not further develop that,

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
at least not too much, for the sake of newer and newer players.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And then after level 50, we see a progression of that part be in the game,

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
focus for the company.

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But how do you see that,

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
well, how does the team think about the progression of that development

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
without making it too advanced for those players?

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, good question.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Paragon board sits in a different place than the skill tree, right?

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Skill tree is like the very first thing you're introduced to as a player.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So keeping that experience really easy to understand and robust

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
for someone that's never played an ARPG before

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is a much harder task compared to Paragon,

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
where Paragon, you've already gotten pretty far into the game

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
or beat the campaign is our expectation.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So we're allowed to add more complexity at that point in the game.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That being said, there are some UX issues

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
that I think we know about with Paragon.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It can be a pain to reset and fill in all the many little blips that you have to.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I think those are actually more concerning issues

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
that I would rather see us tackle than only adding new content.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think we can do both, of course.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But these are kinds of the things of the problems

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that we're looking to solve, I guess you could say, with Paragon.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Simplicity is always a factor

145
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
because we do want people to understand our game

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and ARPGs are notoriously crunchy.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But if there is a place that we can be a little crunchier,

148
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I would say it is in Paragon,

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
if anywhere in our game, if that makes sense.

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's fair.

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We can move on to the next question that we have is

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that as many people are planning their builds in Season 4,

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
we would like to ask for some clarity pre-launch

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
regarding tempering affixes,

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
mostly due to the fact that the patch notes stated

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that they'd be balanced but lack specific details.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I guess the same question applies to core modifiers

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
such as ranks of Golem Mastery

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
being available on multiple item slots.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, lots of people like to ask about Golem Mastery.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I guess what I would say is

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
when it comes to patch notes

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and what we show to players between PTR and live

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
is that we kind of have rules and guidelines

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
for how we present patch notes

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and what we put in them between releases.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And PTR is kind of a special case

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because PTR, we're introducing new content to you

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
for the first time,

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
but then the live patch is actually

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
when we introduce that content for real.

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And I'm using air quotes, right?

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because not everybody is expected to play the PTR.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
PTR is also notoriously not balanced

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
because it's way earlier in development

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
than when we would normally release something.

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And so managing expectations

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and how we present patch notes

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
is something that we're still figuring out.

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And what that really means is

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
when we introduce whole new systems to the game,

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
we don't specify every single little detail of them.

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
As an example, in the PTR,

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
when we introduce the recipes,

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
we don't list every single tempering recipe

186
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and what the numbers are right now in the PTR notes

187
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
because our notes are already huge.

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It would blow them out and make them way bigger, right?

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And then if we don't put them in PTR,

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
but then we put them in live,

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
then we blow out those notes.

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And then it's like, well, why didn't you put them in PTR?

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And then if we only show the difference,

194
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
like only show the things that we change,

195
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
then people are wondering,

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
well, why did you only show

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
like half the tempering recipes?

198
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Those are the ones that you change,

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
but you're not showing the rest.

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And then it can get confusing of like,

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
well, where are the rest of the recipes, right?

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Like, why don't you just show it all?

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And so like, it's an easy kind of thing

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
to get caught up in what we show.

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So in the future, I think we can show more.

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It just means that we would have to like commit

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to showing that in the PTR,

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
which then means there's more pressure on the PTR release

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
to have those things in a better state

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and actually quantify out the bigger list of changes, right?

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So it depends.

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But as far as like specifics,

213
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
if you want to know some of the things

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
like that are changing with tempering,

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
there's a whole lot of number changes.

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Most of them are minor

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and aren't really that big of a deal.

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We did shift around where a few of the recipes

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
or not, yeah, like what stats are

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and what recipes and that kind of stuff

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
to make more sense based on feedback.

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And then we did adjust some things

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
that were just the typical,

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
this is early in development

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and wasn't intended at all,

226
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
but it's PTR.

227
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So, you know, this is when you get to see it.

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The ranks of Golem Mastery is in that category.

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think people were getting crazy,

230
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
like 25 plus or something ranks.

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, it's supposed to be just like

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
every single other passive that you get.

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's only in, you know, very few slots

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and it's very special when you get it.

235
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So, you know, if you were planning on making a Golem build

236
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
where they slam for 2 billion damage,

237
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you're not going to do it via mastery ranks.

238
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But I'm sure there's other ways

239
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
to still make things crazy.

240
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Guys, he got his minion.

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He got his minion question

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and he got an answer there nice and early.

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Got it out of the way.

244
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So, since we're talking about the PTR,

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I just want to slip an additional follow-up to that.

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Did you guys get out of the PTR

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
what you were hoping to get?

248
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I know the players were excited

249
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to actually get their hands on the PTR

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and test it out, etc.

251
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But I'm curious if you guys got

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
what you were hoping to get out of launching a PTR.

253
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, absolutely.

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Absolutely.

255
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
In spades.

256
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
When we released very large swaths of the game,

257
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
like I would say the launch was the closest to this.

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Season 2 was moderately close to this.

259
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I think this is bigger than that

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
because we updated all of itemization, right?

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We gave people stats and powers

262
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
that they never had access to.

263
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Not limited to uniques where we can very control.

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Like, hey, you get this very specific,

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
special, powerful thing.

266
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But in items like, you know,

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
tempering affixes and things

268
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
where we let you get bonus projectiles

269
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
across the board or area size,

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
those are very high-risk things

271
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
from our point of view.

272
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And by risk, I mean like,

273
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
not only are they scary because of balance,

274
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
but they're scary because of like PC performance

275
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and breaking servers and stuff.

276
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Because a lot of our game wasn't made in mind

277
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
with every projectile could not just have one more,

278
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
but be doubled in the amount.

279
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Or, you know, the size of these skills

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
were handcrafted to be, this is the size.

281
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And, you know, when you have a back alley deal,

282
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
like, yep, we're never going to do that again.

283
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Have a handshake.

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We're never going to increase it, whatever,

285
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
because this is what the size is going to be.

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And then we're like, oh, wait,

287
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
we want to double it and do more than that.

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We did more than double in PTR.

289
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We didn't even have a cap.

290
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And so we have to figure out, like,

291
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
how we're going to manage these things

292
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
for the long term and be healthy in the game.

293
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
PTR was incredibly helpful for that.

294
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We got a ton of balance feedback, which is nice.

295
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I would say the bigger important one was,

296
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
like, how does the game feel?

297
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Like, the playing through the whole experience

298
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
of temporary master working and that progression.

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You know, we can have an idea of it,

300
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
but, you know, when you have, you know,

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
50, 100, 200, even 1,000 people playing it,

302
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
it's not nearly as much information

303
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
as you would think compared to, like,

304
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
10 million people playing it, right?

305
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Or whatever.

306
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Like, when you throw numbers at something,

307
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
you really see the cracks very quickly

308
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and very easily, and they're more clear.

309
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Whereas when we're only testing things internally,

310
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
we'll be like, oh, this could be a problem,

311
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
or, oh, this doesn't feel great,

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
but it might be fine, right?

313
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like, we can have a discussion,

314
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and we're using our brains and figuring it out,

315
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
but we don't have the surety that we do

316
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
when we throw a ton of people at it,

317
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
especially people who are experts on ARPGs,

318
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
like you guys and, you know, our other creators

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and even just hardcore community members

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
that really like to crunch these numbers

321
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and figure things out.

322
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They'll find things in five minutes

323
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
that might take us five days, right?

324
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So it's just efficient.

325
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So, yeah.

326
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Short answer, yes, incredibly useful.

327
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I appreciate the insight on that one.

328
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So moving on to the next question here.

329
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So one of the major things that are happening

330
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
in Season 4 is obviously itemization.

331
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That rework is now being complete with Loot Reborn.

332
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What would you guys like to focus on next

333
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
as your next sort of major focus?

334
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

335
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's a really good question.

336
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't get super specific details,

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
but I can give you ideas of how we're thinking

338
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
about things right now.

339
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Sure.

340
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Immediate future, I think actually the focus of the team

341
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
is on reacting to Season 4

342
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and this big upheaval that we made to the game.

343
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I am very sure that there will be cracks

344
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
in tempering and masterworking

345
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and the player journey as far as, you know,

346
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the pit and how all of this feels when put together

347
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
of like how good the game actually is.

348
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And those cracks are going to need to be iterated on

349
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and filled a little bit of like,

350
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
hey, you know, we need more tempering recipes here

351
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
or hey, the progression of the pit

352
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
doesn't feel that great there or whatever, right?

353
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Our immediate thing is

354
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
because we upheavled so much in our game,

355
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
you know, your whole end game way

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
that you interact with Diablo 4

357
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and your item progression is now a journey

358
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
rather than just you hope the perfect item drops

359
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and you're done.

360
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Those are huge foundational things in ARPG.

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So making those and refining those to be good

362
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
is the immediate largest concern

363
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
by a pretty good amount.

364
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like when you, I think when you look at like

365
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
what we're thinking of with updates with Season 5,

366
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
right now I'm being a little bit cagey of like,

367
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I need to leave some reaction time for my team

368
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
and myself to like really look at Season 4

369
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
of what are the things that we need to react to quickly

370
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that would be the most benefit,

371
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
you know, the biggest bane for your buck in Season 5,

372
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
for example.

373
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But thinking a little bit more long-term,

374
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
like things that aren't immediate reactions to Season 4,

375
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I would say, you know,

376
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
we're definitely taking a stab at it in Season 4,

377
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
but I think that there's still going to be room

378
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
to try and make the end game better for longer,

379
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
like have that tail feel good

380
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
for a longer period of time

381
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and have a little bit more refinement

382
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
in that section of the game, so to speak.

383
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So we're thinking and talking a lot about that

384
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
because it's been a thing that we've been,

385
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
you know, asked about by the community basically

386
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
since we launched,

387
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
it's like better end game, better end game,

388
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
better end game.

389
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And so that's something that's on our mind.

390
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Also on the class side, personally,

391
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
one of the things that's on my mind a lot

392
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
is trying to catch up other classes to Barbarian

393
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
because Barbarians have more weapons.

394
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This has been a big thorn in our side

395
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
for a very long time

396
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
of that they kind of have two class mechanics

397
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and everybody else has one.

398
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And so our current plan is to kind of juice up

399
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
those other classes

400
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
so that they're really crazy impactful and good

401
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and feel awesome

402
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
so that they kind of make up

403
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
for the lack of aspects that Barbarians get.

404
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And itemization makes Barbarians stronger.

405
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Like there's a bunch of things

406
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
that having more items

407
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
makes difficult to balance, I would say.

408
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And so really having a firm, solid answer to that.

409
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We kind of addressed it a little bit

410
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
in season four with the Necromancer

411
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
is our first whack at this

412
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
where we just juiced the Book of the Dead

413
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and made it crazy, powerful, and good

414
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and tried to do it in a way

415
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
that wasn't just numbers,

416
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you know, like make it cool, right?

417
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's something that I told my people

418
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
a lot to focus on.

419
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And so we're going to see how that goes

420
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
but I want to do that for the other classes, right?

421
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So that's kind of one of the big things

422
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
at the top of our mind on the class side.

423
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So with in-game...

424
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, sorry, go ahead, Ghazi.

425
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I was just curious.

426
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Like we talk about endgame,

427
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
that's the focus.

428
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Endgame, endgame, endgame.

429
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm curious about the definition.

430
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Like what are we talking about

431
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
when we say endgame?

432
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Because that's different from...

433
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's very subjective, right?

434
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Are we talking about level 50 to 100

435
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
or are we talking about post 100?

436
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yep.

437
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So funny you ask.

438
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think Joe P mentioned in an earlier interview,

439
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
we used to think of endgame

440
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
as everything after the campaign

441
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
was our original definition

442
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
when we launched the game.

443
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And we had to change our definition

444
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
because that wasn't what players

445
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
were thinking and saying

446
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and the way that just people

447
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
talked about our game.

448
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They thought endgame was post 100

449
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
or maybe world tier 4, right?

450
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And right now I would say

451
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
it's still not exactly perfect

452
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
of what we think of when we say endgame.

453
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I think people still have various opinions.

454
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
My definition of endgame

455
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
is probably something close

456
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
to world tier 4

457
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and when that starts

458
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
or when you get to level 100

459
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
is an obvious benchmark

460
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
that people can have.

461
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But in my mind,

462
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
it's when you have access

463
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
to all of the activities

464
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
that you can do in the game,

465
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
which to me would now probably be

466
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
whenever you go into the pit

467
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
because there's no activity after that

468
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that is like a new activity

469
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
that you could not access at all.

470
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So that's what I think of

471
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
when I think of endgame.

472
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But I think if you ask 10 different people,

473
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
you may get like three

474
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
or four different answers.

475
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But that's kind of how we think about it

476
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and talk about it mostly on the team.

477
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Either that or level 100,

478
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,000
you know,

479
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
if you want to think about it that way.

480
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So how do you deal with the difficulty

481
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
of creating endgame

482
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
when players are able

483
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
to consume the content

484
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
quicker than almost any developer

485
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,000
is going to be able

486
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
to produce the endgame

487
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
while also shrinking

488
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the beginning portion of the game?

489
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You level to 100 faster

490
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
than you ever have.

491
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You're able to get into

492
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
these endgame activities

493
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
faster than ever,

494
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
but you're also at a deficit

495
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
in terms of endgame content.

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So you're developing it

497
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
while people are consuming it

498
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,000
faster than you can.

499
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How do you resolve these issues?

500
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, God.

501
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This is a very long answer,

502
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and I could go into it

503
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,000
for a long time,

504
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
so I'll try to keep it brief.

505
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's a very difficult problem,

506
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and it is one that I think

507
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
every ARPG has,

508
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and it's one that we all

509
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
have to kind of live with

510
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and mitigate,

511
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but there isn't a perfect

512
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
forever solution.

513
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because really,

514
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
what you're saying is,

515
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and this is like the two things

516
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that are competing, right,

517
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
is players want content,

518
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and our game is a power fantasy.

519
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's what ARPGs are, right?

520
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We sell you on,

521
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
you do things to become

522
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
more powerful,

523
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to have a new mountain to climb,

524
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to be more powerful,

525
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
to have a new mountain to climb.

526
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Problem is,

527
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
there are only so many mountains

528
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that we can make

529
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
as a development team, right?

530
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Because the mountains

531
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
are usually content.

532
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And so the difficulty

533
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
that I think every ARPG runs into

534
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
is you can only create

535
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000
so many mountains.

536
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So the first thing we try to do

537
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
is create as many mountains

538
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
as we can, right?

539
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Have as many various

540
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,000
endgame activities

541
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and things for you to do

542
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
that are interesting and awesome,

543
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and then, you know,

544
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
do that for as long as we can.

545
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But like you said,

546
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
people are crazy,

547
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and they consume content

548
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
really, really quick.

549
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Some of them do,

550
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
some of them not so much,

551
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and we have to balance

552
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
between those two player types,

553
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
which is a whole other conversation.

554
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But then on the other side,

555
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,000
you know,

556
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
for the people that can consume

557
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
that content quickly,

558
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,000
we want to make sure

559
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
that there's things for them to do

560
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
that are interesting and meaningful, right?

561
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And so this is why you see

562
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
a very common way

563
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
that ARPGs are designed

564
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
is that we use

565
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
random generated dungeons

566
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and random generated content

567
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
for the endgame.

568
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And why we do things

569
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
like scale things

570
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
either pretty hard or infinitely

571
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
so that you have a challenge

572
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
against your player power, right?

573
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Like player power goes up,

574
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
you need something to fight against it

575
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
as you're getting better.

576
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If you don't have something

577
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
to fight against it,

578
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
then really your answers are like,

579
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,000
make another character

580
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and do the journey again,

581
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
or you get bored,

582
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
leave, come back later, right?

583
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And those are kind of the options

584
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
that a player has,

585
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
or, you know,

586
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
go against infinitely scaling content.

587
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's kind of like the box

588
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
that we're in when we're designing.

589
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And a lot of our work as designers

590
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
is how do we make fun content

591
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and resolve these issues

592
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
as best we can.

593
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A perfect solution

594
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
is what requires

595
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
like a paradigm shift,

596
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think of like,

597
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
you have to kind of change

598
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
what an ARPG is

599
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and like make your game ARPG,

600
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
but also a little bit

601
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
of something else

602
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
so that you don't have to worry

603
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,000
about this problem.

604
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But in an ARPG space,

605
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I think this is kind of just

606
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
what it is

607
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and how people progress through it

608
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
is a challenge

609
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
that we're forever going to have.

610
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And so you're going to see us,

611
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,000
you know,

612
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
kind of bounce back and forth

613
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
of like infinitely scaling content,

614
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
but also matching that

615
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
with milestone content

616
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
or aspirational content

617
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,000
is another word

618
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
that people like to use

619
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,000
that I like,

620
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,000
of, you know,

621
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
like Uber Lilith

622
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,000
or these things

623
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
where it's like,

624
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I get this thing,

625
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I see this thing,

626
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
it's a fixed difficulty,

627
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I want to get good enough

628
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,000
to beat that

629
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and then I feel good

630
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and I can either stop

631
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
or try and go to the next thing

632
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
until there's things that run out

633
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and then I'm happy

634
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and I leave happy, right?

635
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Our goal at the higher level

636
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
is that you leave happy, right?

637
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And whether that means

638
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
you're doing aspirational

639
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
or you do forever content

640
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
for a while

641
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and then you kind of churn out,

642
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
we want to make sure

643
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
both of those experiences

644
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
feel good.

645
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Sure.

646
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That's fair.

647
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Listening to that answer,

648
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I mean,

649
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
do you feel like,

650
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
or would it be fair to say

651
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
that the team's focus

652
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
on effort right now

653
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
has gone from the early stage

654
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
of focusing on new player acquisition

655
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
to more of a returning player focus

656
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and endgame replayability

657
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and longevity of the player base?

658
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Is that where the focus is?

659
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Would that be fair to say?

660
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We're focused on both.

661
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I think my team right now

662
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
is focused on the latter part,

663
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
but remember Diablo 4

664
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,000
is a large team

665
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
with many different sub-teams.

666
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm on the live team,

667
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
so my focus right now

668
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
is kind of endgame

669
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,000
because that's just

670
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
what we see as a place

671
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,000
we could do better,

672
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
but there are people

673
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,000
on the team

674
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
absolutely focused

675
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
on new player experience,

676
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
new player,

677
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
how they interact

678
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,000
with the game,

679
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
returning players

680
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that have,

681
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,000
you know,

682
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
they played the original campaign

683
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and then left

684
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and they're coming back.

685
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's a discussion

686
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
that we're having as well

687
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
of how do we make that experience

688
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
the best that we can,

689
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
so there's actually

690
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
a lot of different classes

691
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
of players

692
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and the types of people

693
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
that play Diablo 4

694
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
because it's such a large game.

695
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You know,

696
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
we're trying to appeal

697
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
to many different types

698
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
of people that play RPGs

699
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and even those

700
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
that this is their

701
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
introductory game,

702
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
so our task

703
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
is a little different

704
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
than some other games

705
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
where, you know,

706
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
they have a more specific focus.

707
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We try to grab it all.

708
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We're greedy,

709
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but, you know,

710
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
we want to make sure

711
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,000
that our game's good

712
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
for both parties

713
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and that does mean

714
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
there's some sacrifices sometimes,

715
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
but we really are, like,

716
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
trying to make it good

717
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
for all of them.

718
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That's fair.

719
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's a hard problem,

720
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
but that is actually

721
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
what we're trying to do,

722
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
like high-level vision.

723
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Let's just move on

724
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
to the next question

725
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
since we're kind of

726
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,000
limited on time.

727
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

728
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's talk about

729
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
overworld content

730
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
since that is literally

731
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
the identity defining

732
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
for Diablo 4, right?

733
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And the question we have

734
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,000
is what are the team's

735
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
thoughts on the potentials

736
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
of strongholds and bosses

737
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
having a bigger role

738
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
to play moving forward?

739
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, strongholds and bosses.

740
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I guess I'll ask you

741
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,000
a question back.

742
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I can give you

743
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
a very easy answer,

744
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and that answer will be

745
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
we think they're cool

746
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and we can work on them,

747
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
or I can give you, like,

748
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,000
something I think

749
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
is a lot more interesting

750
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
than maybe an in-depth discussion.

751
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll leave it up to you guys.

752
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Let's go for the latter.

753
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah.

754
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
All right.

755
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Because I find this

756
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
very interesting.

757
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Why strongholds,

758
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
why we design them

759
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and what we think about them

760
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
in Borah bosses.

761
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So I think there's a concept

762
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
that's very interesting.

763
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I would advise you

764
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and anyone that any

765
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,000
of your followers

766
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
who really want to get

767
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,000
into game design

768
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
or want to talk better

769
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
about game design,

770
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
there was a really great

771
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
GDC presentation

772
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
made by a guy named

773
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Alex Jaffe.

774
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
He's from Riot, actually.

775
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And he gave one of the best

776
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
presentations I've ever seen

777
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
on game design.

778
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And he gave a presentation

779
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,000
on something called

780
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
cursed problems

781
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
in game design.

782
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And I promise this

783
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
will lead back to strongholds

784
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
very directly.

785
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But what a cursed problem

786
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
is in game design

787
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
is this idea that

788
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
when you make a game

789
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
of a certain archetype,

790
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
you immediately make

791
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
a bunch of promises

792
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,000
to the player.

793
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And these promises

794
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
come with problems

795
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
that we call cursed problems.

796
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,000
They're these things

797
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
that are so fundamental

798
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
to the foundation

799
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
of your game

800
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
that you can't get away

801
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
from them.

802
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And they're kind of

803
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
your partner forever

804
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
or weight on your back

805
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
that you have to deal with

806
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
that you never get rid of.

807
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But you can mitigate.

808
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'll give an example

809
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
of a cursed problem

810
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
in another genre and game.

811
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I used to work on

812
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Heroes of the Storm.

813
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's a MOBA, right?

814
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Like League of Legends.

815
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If you ever played

816
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,000
League of Legends,

817
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
you'll hear this complaint

818
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
a lot of matchmaking

819
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and playing a team-based game

820
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
by having individual progression, right?

821
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The promise that you make

822
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
when you play a MOBA

823
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
or a team-based game

824
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
is that you are playing

825
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
with other people.

826
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But one of the big things

827
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
that they sell you on

828
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
when you play the game

829
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,000
is that you have

830
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
a ranking system

831
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
that's based on

832
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
your personal improvement.

833
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So you're being ranked

834
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,000
individually,

835
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
but you go into a team game

836
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
with nine other people

837
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and those other people

838
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
can interact

839
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and you can have a game

840
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,000
where you couldn't have won

841
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
no matter how good you are

842
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
because those gay people

843
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
impact your performance.

844
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And so you commonly

845
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
get the complaint of,

846
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,000
hey, I went into

847
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
a team-based game.

848
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I did well,

849
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
but my teammates suck

850
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and I'm mad

851
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
because I lost ranking points, right?

852
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I played League of Legends.

853
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's very common.

854
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
This is a cursed problem

855
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
of matchmaking-based,

856
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,000
team-based games

857
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
where your motivation

858
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
that we promise you

859
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
is individual performance.

860
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,000
How about Diablo?

861
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Let's tie it back to Diablo.

862
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
A cursed problem,

863
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I would argue,

864
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
in ARPGs like Diablo

865
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and any other game,

866
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
you'll probably have seen

867
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,000
this problem,

868
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
is that they are games

869
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,000
of efficiency.

870
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We promise you

871
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
player power

872
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
is a big reason

873
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
why you play these games.

874
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If you want to go in,

875
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
you start off

876
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
as this peon person

877
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
that kind of sucks

878
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and isn't very strong

879
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and you grow into

880
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
this really crazy

881
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
master of magic

882
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
or strength or whatever

883
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
that can do

884
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
incredible things, right?

885
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And the way that we deliver

886
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,000
you on that promise

887
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
is we give you power

888
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
as you play the game more

889
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and progress through

890
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,000
the activities,

891
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
usually in the form of gear

892
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
but also in other ways too, right?

893
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Skill points, paragon,

894
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,000
whatever it is.

895
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
What that translates to

896
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
is that anything

897
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
that you are doing

898
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
in the game

899
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that isn't progressing

900
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,000
your power

901
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
is very hard

902
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
to sell a player on

903
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
to make them

904
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
want to do it.

905
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And it's even harder

906
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
to sell them

907
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
if it's not

908
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
a repeatable activity

909
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
that they can keep doing

910
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
to get stronger

911
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and stronger.

912
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The way that I describe

913
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
curse problems

914
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,000
or think about it

915
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
is like when you ask me,

916
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
hey Adam,

917
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,000
what do you think

918
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
of strongholds

919
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
or world bosses

920
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
or uber lilith balance

921
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
or a whole lot

922
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,000
of other problems,

923
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I would think of

924
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
these curse problems

925
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
like a tree

926
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and the curse problem

927
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
is actually the trunk,

928
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
the center of the game,

929
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
what the game actually is

930
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and why you come to play it

931
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and you're asking me

932
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,000
about a leaf

933
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
at the very edge

934
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
of the branch

935
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
and so I can give an answer

936
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
like yeah,

937
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,000
the leaf,

938
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
yeah, it's cool,

939
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,000
we can work on it

940
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
but like really

941
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
the leaf connecting

942
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
to the branch,

943
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
connecting to the trunk,

944
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
this is what's actually

945
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
causing the thing

946
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
that you're asking

947
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,000
the question about,

948
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000
right?

949
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So when it comes

950
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
to strongholds,

951
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
why are strongholds,

952
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,000
why do you ask me

953
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
the question like,

954
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,000
hey, what about strongholds,

955
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
can we make them better?

956
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The reason why

957
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
it's a question

958
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,000
that people ask,

959
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I think,

960
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
is because people,

961
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
strongholds are intended

962
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and why they are cool

963
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and why they go against

964
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
the rest of our game

965
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and why it's really hard

966
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
for us is that

967
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
they are meant to be

968
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,000
one-shot,

969
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,000
awesome,

970
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
kind of story-based,

971
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
really hand-crafted,

972
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
curated content,

973
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,000
right?

974
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I would equate this

975
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
to Uberlilla statues

976
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
where we got this question

977
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,000
the other day,

978
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
the campaign experience,

979
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,000
we get a question,

980
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
these are all actually

981
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
the same question,

982
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
which is,

983
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,000
hey,

984
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
you people on D4

985
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
made this one-shot experience

986
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
that we really love

987
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and is cool,

988
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
we want to do it more.

989
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The problem is,

990
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the moment you cross that line

991
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
from one-shotting

992
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and it being cool

993
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
to being a repeatable activity,

994
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
now that activity

995
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,000
is competing

996
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
with everything else

997
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
in the game

998
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
that is repeatable content.

999
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Because now,

1000
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
strongholds has to compete

1001
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
against Helltide,

1002
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Nightmare Dungeons,

1003
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
The Pit,

1004
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Gathering Uniques,

1005
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
all of that,

1006
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,000
or has to fit in there

1007
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
in some way.

1008
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
So one question

1009
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
about that then,

1010
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
so what makes

1011
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
strongholds different?

1012
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Like,

1013
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
why can't we do

1014
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
an Uber version

1015
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,000
of a stronghold

1016
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
since people say

1017
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
they want to replay it,

1018
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
but we can do

1019
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,000
an Uber version

1020
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
of bosses

1021
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that are already

1022
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
in the game.

1023
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So we can do the level...

1024
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We absolutely,

1025
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,000
yeah,

1026
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I understand your question,

1027
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
we absolutely can,

1028
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
is the answer.

1029
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But then,

1030
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
you've changed it,

1031
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
the fundamental relationship

1032
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
that you have as a player

1033
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
with strongholds

1034
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,000
is different now.

1035
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You've changed it

1036
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
from one shot,

1037
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
this is a cool experience,

1038
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
that's very unique,

1039
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
and that is what

1040
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
the fantasy is

1041
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
of people that like it,

1042
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
now you've changed that

1043
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
to repeatable content

1044
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,000
that you're going to do

1045
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
10, 20, 100 times over.

1046
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And the thing is,

1047
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
a lot of content,

1048
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and this is where

1049
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
it's kind of a curse problem

1050
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,000
in the RPG,

1051
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
we think of every content type

1052
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
that we add this way.

1053
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Is it repeatable?

1054
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Is it not?

1055
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And the way that you design

1056
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,000
that content

1057
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
is very different.

1058
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Because if it's repeatable,

1059
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
that means that you have

1060
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
to design the content

1061
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,000
in such a way

1062
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
that it is fun

1063
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
100 or 1000 times.

1064
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That puts a lot more

1065
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
design constraint

1066
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and limitations

1067
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
of what you can make

1068
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,000
that content.

1069
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
As an example,

1070
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
or many examples

1071
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,000
when you launch the game,

1072
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
you can even think

1073
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
of some when you

1074
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
think of your experience

1075
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
with the game.

1076
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,000
When you do something

1077
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
500 times,

1078
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,000
you care about things

1079
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
that you wouldn't care about

1080
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
if you did it one time.

1081
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
This is why,

1082
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,000
for example,

1083
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I get questions a lot

1084
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
of why can't,

1085
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
can you let us reset boss rooms?

1086
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Why do you want

1087
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,000
to reset boss rooms?

1088
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's because you do it

1089
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
500 times and it sucks

1090
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
to do that every single time.

1091
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If you had to do it

1092
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
one or two times ever,

1093
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
you wouldn't care very much.

1094
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Why did you have to

1095
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,000
ride your horse

1096
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
to Nightmare Dungeons

1097
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
when we launched the game?

1098
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It's fair.

1099
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It was fun the first time.

1100
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
World building,

1101
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,000
immersion,

1102
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
really cool.

1103
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Doing it 500 times

1104
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
because that's all

1105
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,000
that you're doing

1106
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
at your end game,

1107
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,000
not so fun.

1108
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So would you be concerned

1109
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
about the same issue

1110
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
with the new 200 bosses

1111
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,000
if let's say

1112
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you took some of the rewards

1113
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and added like an Uber,

1114
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
just for the sake

1115
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
of the debate here.

1116
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So let's say

1117
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
we wanted Uber Strongholds

1118
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
and you say,

1119
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,000
well, you know,

1120
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,000
DM,

1121
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
you liked it the first time.

1122
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You might not like it

1123
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
the 100th time

1124
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and I say,

1125
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
fair enough.

1126
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But then I come back

1127
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
with you and say,

1128
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,000
okay,

1129
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,000
well,

1130
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
what if we took

1131
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
some of the rewards

1132
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I would either get

1133
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
from the pit,

1134
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,000
like a grab bag.

1135
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We take some of the pit rewards,

1136
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
take some of the Uber

1137
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
level 200 rewards

1138
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and we throw almost

1139
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,000
like a world boss

1140
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
loop pinata

1141
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
as an option

1142
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
to be one of these mountains

1143
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
that you mentioned earlier.

1144
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Maybe we don't want

1145
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
to make it the best thing.

1146
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Maybe we want to make it

1147
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
a breakup of the experience

1148
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
so that we can get

1149
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
basically the same resources

1150
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
we got to get

1151
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,000
literally anyway

1152
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
from something else.

1153
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But it gives us variety

1154
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
in terms of gameplay.

1155
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Now I'm not arguing

1156
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,000
this is the best way

1157
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
to go with the game.

1158
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm just curious

1159
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
about the thought process

1160
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
behind that.

1161
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I think that's a good question.

1162
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The answer is yes,

1163
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
we can.

1164
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Sometimes it works,

1165
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
sometimes it doesn't.

1166
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Usually it doesn't.

1167
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But the reason why

1168
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
in my experience

1169
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
designing ARPGs

1170
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,000
for a while now

1171
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
is it's really hard

1172
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
to tell somebody,

1173
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
hey, you have option A

1174
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and option B.

1175
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Option A is 100% efficient.

1176
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Option B is 70% efficient.

1177
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What does 100% of players do?

1178
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Maxroll makes guides.

1179
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What is the best

1180
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,000
nightmare dungeon

1181
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
you want to do?

1182
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Everybody makes guides.

1183
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
What is the quickest way

1184
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,000
to do the thing?

1185
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,000
What is the most efficient?

1186
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
People are going to do the thing

1187
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and it's not like

1188
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
if something is 100% efficient

1189
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
versus 50%,

1190
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
that 50% of players

1191
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
do the 50%

1192
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and the other half

1193
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
do the 100%.

1194
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That's not how it works out

1195
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
in player behavior.

1196
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's 99% of people

1197
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
do the 100% efficient.

1198
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,000
That's a fair counter.

1199
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That's a fair counter.

1200
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm not sure I agree entirely.

1201
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm a player that

1202
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I guess I would qualify

1203
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
as a blaster

1204
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and not a casual player.

1205
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But I feel like

1206
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
what makes an ARPG great

1207
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
is to make people

1208
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
distracted from the fact

1209
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
that they are playing an ARPG.

1210
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Because in reality,

1211
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
an ARPG game

1212
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
is honestly

1213
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,000
the very definition

1214
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
of insanity.

1215
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We are doing the same thing

1216
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
over and over and over again

1217
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
with the only goal

1218
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
of improving our character

1219
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
to continue doing

1220
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,000
the same thing

1221
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
over and over again

1222
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
to do the same thing.

1223
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And the best ARPG

1224
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
is the game

1225
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
that you can play

1226
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
would be a game

1227
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
where you are distracted

1228
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,000
from the fact

1229
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
that you're doing

1230
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,000
the same thing

1231
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
over and over again.

1232
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So having options

1233
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000
whether or not

1234
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
they are slightly less rewarding

1235
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
is another part.

1236
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That's another topic.

1237
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But the fact

1238
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
that you have options

1239
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to engage with

1240
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
for the sake of in-game

1241
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
replayability,

1242
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
longevity

1243
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
would allow you

1244
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
to be distracted

1245
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
from that fact

1246
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
and actually enjoy your time.

1247
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That's the way I see it.

1248
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So I'm not sure

1249
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I entirely agree with that.

1250
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I completely agree with you.

1251
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I want to premise this.

1252
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm presenting to you

1253
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
the problem.

1254
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm not saying that

1255
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
a cursed problem

1256
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
has no solutions

1257
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and no ways

1258
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,000
to make it better.

1259
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
The bulk of my time

1260
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
is spent trying to

1261
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
answer the questions

1262
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
that you guys just asked

1263
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
and do it in a way

1264
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
that does make it better

1265
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
even though I know

1266
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
it's a problem

1267
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,000
that will never be

1268
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
completely absolutely solved.

1269
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
We do do things like this.

1270
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Some ways, for example,

1271
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
that we get you to do

1272
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
a variety of activities

1273
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
because we do want you to

1274
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
is like a common strategy

1275
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
is we gate certain rewards

1276
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
behind certain activities

1277
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
which makes you

1278
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,000
you need to go

1279
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and do multiple things.

1280
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Right?

1281
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Like you have glyph XP

1282
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and nightmare dungeons.

1283
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You have the helltide

1284
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
the cinders and helltide

1285
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
that you couldn't really get

1286
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,000
very easily.

1287
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
We have things

1288
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
that are special to them

1289
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
to make you go around.

1290
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I think a better solution

1291
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
we've kind of moved

1292
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,000
a little bit more

1293
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
in this is you

1294
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
you can get things

1295
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
you get some activities

1296
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
or materials

1297
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,000
or whatever

1298
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
from many places.

1299
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
There is one place

1300
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,000
that is the most efficient

1301
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
but you're getting

1302
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
pseudo-efficiency

1303
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
somewhere else

1304
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and that feels really good.

1305
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Example of this

1306
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
would be doing helltides

1307
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,000
with whispers.

1308
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Right?

1309
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
If you're doing helltides

1310
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and you want Varshan materials

1311
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
for whispers

1312
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
double dipping on that

1313
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
feels really good

1314
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,000
as a player

1315
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and we want to do that

1316
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and do that more

1317
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and that I think

1318
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
is kind of an answer

1319
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
for your uber strongholds question

1320
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
is I'm not saying

1321
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,000
by the way

1322
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
my answer is not

1323
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
we can't do uber strongholds

1324
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
because of these problems.

1325
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What I'm saying is

1326
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm trying to teach you

1327
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
why it's not so easy

1328
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,000
as just like

1329
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
hey make uber strongholds

1330
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
replayable

1331
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and now everybody's

1332
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,000
going to level them immediately.

1333
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Right?

1334
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
We were changing

1335
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,000
a content type

1336
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
from a one shot

1337
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
this is kind of

1338
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
similar to the campaign idea

1339
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
of changing the campaign experience

1340
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
from a one shot

1341
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
to a feels good

1342
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000
a hundred times

1343
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
we have to think about

1344
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
that we think about

1345
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
that content differently now.

1346
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Totally.

1347
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And that requires

1348
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
a little more thought

1349
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and care

1350
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
not just in rewards

1351
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
but how it feels

1352
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,000
to go through it

1353
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
over and over again

1354
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,000
right?

1355
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Because it's fixed.

1356
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That's fair enough.

1357
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
We need to add some randomness

1358
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
to make it feel better

1359
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,000
as you're going through it

1360
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
over and over again.

1361
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It makes sense.

1362
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
There's more problems

1363
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
that we have to solve.

1364
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's a design consumable

1365
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
you make it into

1366
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
something repetitive

1367
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
it changes the fundamentals

1368
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
of how you originally

1369
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,000
created it.

1370
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I can understand the take.

1371
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I appreciate that.

1372
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'll move the conversation

1373
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
on here

1374
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
so we can get into

1375
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
some of the other questions

1376
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,000
we still have here.

1377
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So currently

1378
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
build variety in the game

1379
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
is mostly designed

1380
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
around item modifier.

1381
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So like unique items

1382
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
with this wall

1383
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
it's been one example.

1384
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It just fundamentally

1385
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
changes the way

1386
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
its skill works here.

1387
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Has there been discussion

1388
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
from the team

1389
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
around modifying skills

1390
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
potentially outside

1391
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
of unique items

1392
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
like within Paragon boards

1393
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
other inventory based items

1394
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,000
whatever you want to call it?

1395
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Yeah.

1396
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Fun fact

1397
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
when we were originally

1398
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,000
designing things

1399
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
in the game

1400
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
a lot of the changing

1401
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,000
of the skills

1402
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
was actually in the skill tree

1403
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and in the

1404
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,000
we called them

1405
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
maybe choices

1406
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
but you know

1407
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
the different upgrades

1408
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,000
you could get

1409
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
for your skill.

1410
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
the original

1411
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
thought behind it

1412
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
was like

1413
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,000
you know

1414
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
you can make your

1415
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,000
you know

1416
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
frozen orb

1417
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
like option A

1418
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,000
is like

1419
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
way different

1420
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,000
than option B

1421
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
where they're almost

1422
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
like different use cases

1423
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
for the skill.

1424
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Right?

1425
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And we moved

1426
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
a little bit away

1427
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,000
from that.

1428
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Some of them

1429
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,000
are still a little

1430
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
transformative.

1431
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I think that we can

1432
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,000
make them a little bit

1433
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
more so in the skill tree

1434
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
as we do in the future.

1435
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That's one way

1436
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,000
that I think we can

1437
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
make the skill tree

1438
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,000
interesting

1439
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
without introducing

1440
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
a bunch of complexity.

1441
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
My favorite example

1442
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I give to people

1443
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,000
on my team

1444
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
is a kick.

1445
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You know

1446
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
kick isn't that

1447
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
popular of a skill

1448
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,000
but the difference

1449
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
between baseline kick

1450
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and power kick

1451
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
the upgrade

1452
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
where it changes

1453
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
into basically

1454
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
a core skill

1455
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,000
where it uses

1456
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
all your resource

1457
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and does a buttload

1458
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
of damage to a person.

1459
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You know

1460
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
you went from

1461
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,000
thinking of

1462
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you know

1463
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
this skill is like

1464
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,000
you think of the

1465
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
geometry of the game

1466
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and kicking enemies

1467
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,000
into walls

1468
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
and it was too complex

1469
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I think a little bit

1470
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
for what we launched

1471
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
with the speed

1472
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,000
of our game.

1473
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But the idea

1474
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
was there of like

1475
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,000
one way is

1476
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you're playing

1477
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,000
4D chests

1478
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
and you're rewarded

1479
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and the other way

1480
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
is you chase a resource

1481
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and you just

1482
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
you know

1483
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
this is Sparta

1484
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,000
somebody

1485
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and kill them

1486
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
for a billion damage

1487
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,000
right?

1488
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's completely

1489
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
different fantasies

1490
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and ways that you

1491
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,000
interact with a skill.

1492
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I think we could

1493
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000
probably do a little

1494
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
bit more there

1495
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
with other skills

1496
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,000
to kind of make

1497
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
them transformative

1498
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
like that.

1499
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We ended up

1500
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
doing more legendaries

1501
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and uniques

1502
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
as the space

1503
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
that we do that

1504
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,000
because we knew

1505
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
that items

1506
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
were so important

1507
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and being excited

1508
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
for a late game

1509
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,000
item to drop

1510
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
was a very core

1511
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
part of the game.

1512
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
We've kind of

1513
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,000
now made that

1514
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
a lot better

1515
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
with like greater

1516
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
affixes for example

1517
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
and things in season 4.

1518
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So I think

1519
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
there is more room

1520
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
to make transformative

1521
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
upgrades in other

1522
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
places than items

1523
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
but I also am

1524
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,000
very comfortable

1525
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
with the system

1526
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
that we have now

1527
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and I kind of like it

1528
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
it gives you obvious

1529
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
things to chase

1530
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
with items

1531
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and it feels good

1532
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
to get an item

1533
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
that is a big upgrade

1534
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
that changes how you play.

1535
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So I guess

1536
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'd be open to feedback

1537
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
from people

1538
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
like is there a place

1539
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
that you think

1540
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
is superior to items

1541
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
to get these kinds

1542
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
of effects?

1543
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Like is it cooler

1544
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
to have it be deterministic

1545
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
in the Paragon board

1546
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
versus you're farming

1547
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,000
for something

1548
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
and you see the moment

1549
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
that it drops

1550
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,000
that transforms

1551
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
your gameplay?

1552
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I mean I'd be in the boat

1553
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
of saying

1554
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
you know

1555
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
make the skill tweak

1556
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
grow into a tree.

1557
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That's kind of the boat

1558
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
that I'm sitting in

1559
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
but I also understand

1560
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
from the interview

1561
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
you had with Rax

1562
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,000
how that is

1563
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
there's reasons

1564
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,000
for that

1565
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,000
to keep it

1566
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
that simplistic

1567
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
so it makes sense

1568
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,000
to have it

1569
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
in the endgame version

1570
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,000
of something dropping

1571
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
or you know

1572
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
a gem

1573
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,000
or whatever

1574
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
you want to go

1575
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
for a power

1576
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
or a unique item.

1577
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But how

1578
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
unless you have

1579
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
any follow-up questions

1580
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,000
at DM

1581
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I wanted to ask you

1582
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
about how that fits

1583
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
into the philosophy

1584
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
of a lead class designer

1585
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
when it comes

1586
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,000
to the fantasies

1587
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
these altering skills

1588
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
or uniques

1589
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,000
whatever you want

1590
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
to go for

1591
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
would have an impact

1592
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
on the class design.

1593
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'm sorry

1594
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,000
not quite sure

1595
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm going to try

1596
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
to reword that

1597
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,000
that was horrible.

1598
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Don't worry.

1599
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
No I was wondering

1600
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
how these unique items

1601
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
or skill altering

1602
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
modifiers

1603
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,000
no matter where

1604
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
you get them

1605
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
how that would impact

1606
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
the class design

1607
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
when it comes

1608
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000
to focusing

1609
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
on keeping

1610
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
or maintaining

1611
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
the specific

1612
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
fantasies of classes.

1613
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah

1614
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
so when I think

1615
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
of a build

1616
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
or a team

1617
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,000
thinks of a build

1618
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
we try and think

1619
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
of the entire package

1620
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and we compare it

1621
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
to the whole other

1622
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
package of a class.

1623
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I don't think

1624
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
of a build

1625
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
like I don't know

1626
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Frozen or

1627
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
let's say

1628
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
right when I think

1629
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,000
of like the total

1630
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
power and coolness

1631
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,000
and strength

1632
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and all that

1633
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
there's a journey

1634
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
that needs to be made

1635
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,000
but I think of it

1636
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
as you end

1637
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
with all the things

1638
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
right you end

1639
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
with the conjurations

1640
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
casting Frozen orbs

1641
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000
and you're blowing

1642
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
up everything

1643
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,000
on your screen

1644
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
it's awesome

1645
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,000
right

1646
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
so when we think

1647
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
about like

1648
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
designing a new

1649
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
class or when

1650
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,000
we're first designing

1651
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
these classes

1652
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,000
we have to think

1653
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
of you know

1654
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
how do we make

1655
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
an interesting

1656
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and good player

1657
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
journey from

1658
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
the beginning

1659
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
when you first

1660
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,000
use a skill

1661
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
making that

1662
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,000
as impactful

1663
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and cool

1664
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,000
as possible

1665
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
while at the

1666
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,000
same time

1667
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
balancing against

1668
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,000
you need to

1669
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
leave room

1670
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
for growth

1671
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
and making

1672
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
things crazy

1673
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,000
and also

1674
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
make it better

1675
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
some skills

1676
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
are easier

1677
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000
to do

1678
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000
than others

1679
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
with that

1680
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I would say

1681
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
we definitely

1682
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
had a lot

1683
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,000
of things

1684
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
before the game

1685
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,000
came out

1686
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
discussions

1687
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,000
about like

1688
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
hey this skill

1689
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,000
doesn't

1690
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
it feels

1691
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,000
really crappy

1692
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
early on

1693
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and we're like

1694
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
yeah it gets

1695
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,000
really crazy

1696
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
later on though

1697
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,000
they're like

1698
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
yeah but

1699
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,000
who's gonna

1700
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
pick it up

1701
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,000
if it feels

1702
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,000
really shitty

1703
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
early on

1704
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,000
right

1705
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
like

1706
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,000
you have to

1707
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
balance the

1708
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,000
two things

1709
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and that one

1710
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,000
is like

1711
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
it's just

1712
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,000
a bunch

1713
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,000
of discussions

1714
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and iteration

1715
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
even when the

1716
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,000
game is live

1717
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
of people

1718
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
complain about it

1719
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,000
right

1720
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,000
and we're like

1721
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
yeah we agree

1722
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,000
and then we

1723
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,000
change it

1724
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
example that

1725
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
would be like

1726
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
barbs and jurids

1727
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,000
for a while

1728
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
have been

1729
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,000
complaining that

1730
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
early game

1731
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,000
kind of sucks

1732
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
but then late game

1733
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,000
they're powerhouses

1734
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and that's kind

1735
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,000
of been the identity

1736
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and so we've been

1737
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
like alleviating

1738
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
over and over again

1739
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
like basic skills

1740
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
are a little better

1741
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,000
they're a little better

1742
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
we don't want to go

1743
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,000
too far

1744
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
but we keep

1745
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,000
making them better

1746
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
right

1747
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
so that's kind

1748
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,000
of how we think

1749
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,000
of it

1750
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
we think of the

1751
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,000
whole package

1752
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and we try to

1753
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
make sure that

1754
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,000
your journey

1755
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
is enjoyable

1756
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,000
and good

1757
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and that's true

1758
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
by the way

1759
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,000
with items

1760
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and tempering

1761
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and stuff

1762
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,000
right

1763
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,000
we tried to

1764
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
create that

1765
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,000
journey

1766
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,000
and itemization

1767
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
that was

1768
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
the point

1769
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,000
of season 4

1770
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
because we think

1771
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
that's what makes

1772
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
a good ARPG experience

1773
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
absolutely

1774
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
so we have

1775
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
we're approaching

1776
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
about 10 minutes

1777
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
or so left

1778
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,000
here right around

1779
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
there so

1780
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,000
we do have

1781
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
some rapid fire

1782
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,000
section

1783
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
which I mean

1784
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
not all of these

1785
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,000
are just yes

1786
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and no type things

1787
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
so you feel free

1788
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
to talk about

1789
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,000
these don't have

1790
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,000
to just be

1791
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
like one word

1792
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,000
answers

1793
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
but we have

1794
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
about 15-20

1795
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,000
of these

1796
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm going to

1797
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
try to blast

1798
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,000
through that

1799
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
these are mostly

1800
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
primary questions

1801
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,000
grabbed from

1802
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
YouTube comments

1803
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
grabbed from

1804
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
the chats

1805
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,000
etc

1806
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
the community

1807
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,000
just continues

1808
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,000
to ask

1809
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
over and over

1810
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,000
again

1811
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
some of these

1812
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,000
may have already

1813
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
been asked

1814
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,000
apologize if they

1815
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
have but just

1816
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,000
because they've

1817
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
been spammed

1818
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,000
quite a bit

1819
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
one of the ones

1820
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
we've seen

1821
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
quite often

1822
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
is people

1823
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,000
are asking

1824
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
about raids

1825
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
so we have

1826
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
overworld bosses

1827
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,000
right

1828
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
pretty cool

1829
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,000
people like

1830
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,000
them

1831
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
it's like a

1832
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
big lube

1833
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
pinata

1834
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
every now and

1835
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,000
then

1836
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,000
is there any

1837
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
plans of

1838
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,000
further

1839
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
developments

1840
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,000
or have

1841
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,000
you guys

1842
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
thought about

1843
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
potentially of

1844
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,000
raids like

1845
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
8-man

1846
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,000
10-man

1847
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
related to

1848
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,000
clans

1849
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
larger size

1850
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,000
basically

1851
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
yeah

1852
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
first I would

1853
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
say this is

1854
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
just Adam's

1855
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
personal opinion

1856
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
not the team

1857
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
because I know

1858
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,000
everybody has

1859
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
different thoughts

1860
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,000
on it but

1861
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I think raids

1862
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
are interesting

1863
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
and cool

1864
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I think that

1865
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,000
they would

1866
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
present quite

1867
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
a few

1868
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
hurdles for us

1869
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
to overcome

1870
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
that make

1871
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
things tough

1872
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I think they're

1873
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
probably doable

1874
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
but as an

1875
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
example of some

1876
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
of the things I

1877
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,000
think of right

1878
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
away that are

1879
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,000
like oh my

1880
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
god this is

1881
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
scary is like

1882
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
even now we

1883
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
have a problem

1884
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
where we're

1885
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
always competing

1886
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
against solo

1887
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
players efficiency

1888
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
versus group

1889
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,000
play efficiency

1890
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
there's a lot

1891
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
of people

1892
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that play

1893
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Diablo

1894
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,000
and RPGs

1895
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
that really

1896
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
have a strong

1897
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,000
identity with

1898
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
wanting to play

1899
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,000
by themselves

1900
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
and not be

1901
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,000
required to go

1902
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
into a group

1903
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
and if we put

1904
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
in this type

1905
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,000
of content

1906
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
where we say

1907
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
hey you must

1908
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,000
go into a

1909
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
group to play

1910
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
this then we

1911
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
you know we

1912
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
have to reconcile

1913
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,000
that of like

1914
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
hey do we

1915
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
how do we

1916
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,000
either balance

1917
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
that around

1918
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,000
solo players

1919
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
do it as well

1920
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
and if they do

1921
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,000
then why is it

1922
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
group content

1923
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
or yeah too

1924
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
bad you have to

1925
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
also be in a

1926
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,000
group to engage

1927
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
with this and

1928
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
then that puts

1929
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,000
a lot of

1930
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
pressure on the

1931
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
rewards for that

1932
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,000
content because

1933
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
if we make

1934
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the rewards

1935
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
something that

1936
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,000
a solo player

1937
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
also needs

1938
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,000
then we're

1939
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
making them

1940
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,000
go into a

1941
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
group when

1942
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,000
they may not

1943
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
want to

1944
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
but if we

1945
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,000
make the

1946
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
rewards for

1947
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,000
that type of

1948
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
content the

1949
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
other way where

1950
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,000
it's not

1951
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
something you

1952
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,000
need then why

1953
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
do people do

1954
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,000
it in the

1955
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,000
first place

1956
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
so there's

1957
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,000
like there's

1958
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
a lot of

1959
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,000
questions there

1960
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
that are

1961
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
noodley that

1962
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
are tough to

1963
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
answer

1964
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
but I'm

1965
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,000
really just

1966
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
describing the

1967
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000
problem space

1968
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I do think

1969
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,000
though that

1970
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
overall the

1971
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
idea of getting

1972
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,000
with a group

1973
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
of your buddies

1974
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,000
or random

1975
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
strangers and

1976
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
doing like a

1977
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,000
10 man fight

1978
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
on a huge

1979
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,000
like you know

1980
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
dungeon or

1981
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
whatever with

1982
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
a big boss

1983
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,000
at the end

1984
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,000
that requires

1985
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
mechanics like

1986
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
that is really

1987
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
cool and

1988
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
appealing so

1989
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
so then

1990
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,000
that's kind of

1991
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
how I think

1992
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,000
of it so I

1993
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
got two more

1994
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,000
quick ones here

1995
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
and I'll pass

1996
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,000
off to Gazi

1997
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
so in that

1998
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
case then if

1999
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,000
there's issues

2000
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
related to like

2001
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
having forcing

2002
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
group play

2003
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
basically let's

2004
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000
go the other

2005
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
way and say

2006
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
solo self

2007
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
out mode now

2008
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000
the trading is

2009
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
more common

2010
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,000
here with

2011
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
legendary items

2012
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
etc have we

2013
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,000
seen the

2014
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
potential for

2015
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,000
maybe adding

2016
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,000
an additional

2017
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
game mode or

2018
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
other game

2019
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
modes I think

2020
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
it'd be cool

2021
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,000
nothing to

2022
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
announce today

2023
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
fair enough

2024
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
next one

2025
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
pvp there is

2026
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
a small but

2027
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,000
very passionate

2028
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
pvp community

2029
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
that is curious

2030
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
about further

2031
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
plans involving

2032
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
content specifically

2033
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
for these groups

2034
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
of people I

2035
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,000
promise them I'd

2036
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
ask this one for

2037
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
them what are

2038
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000
your thoughts on

2039
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
pvp within the

2040
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
game sure

2041
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
um don't have

2042
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
anything to

2043
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,000
announce when it

2044
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
comes to pvp

2045
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
specific content

2046
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I would say we

2047
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I think we would

2048
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
be more interested

2049
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,000
for from those

2050
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
people like what

2051
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
would they want

2052
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
to see from

2053
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
us I would

2054
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,000
actually be

2055
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
curious about

2056
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
of like what

2057
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,000
do you want do

2058
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,000
you want like an

2059
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
arena type system

2060
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
where we pre

2061
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
program your

2062
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
gear for you do

2063
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,000
you like open

2064
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
world do you do

2065
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
you want some

2066
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,000
type of different

2067
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
progression system

2068
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
you know kind of

2069
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,000
like the group

2070
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
versus solo play

2071
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
the pvp versus

2072
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
pve discussion is

2073
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
a little similar

2074
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
of like the more

2075
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
that we emphasize

2076
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
it or give unique

2077
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
rewards to it the

2078
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,000
more that we're

2079
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
saying to everybody

2080
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,000
that doesn't want

2081
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
to do that hey

2082
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
you must do this

2083
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,000
to progress your

2084
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
character and

2085
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
that's back to

2086
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
that you know

2087
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
cursed problem

2088
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
trunk theory like

2089
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,000
sure you know

2090
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
everything is about

2091
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
power progression so

2092
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the moment we put

2093
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
power in an activity

2094
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
that's a little more

2095
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
niche then we can

2096
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
really make people

2097
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
unhappy if that's if

2098
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
they have to engage

2099
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,000
with that so like

2100
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
what would they want

2101
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
to see do they want

2102
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,000
to see a better way

2103
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
of interacting with

2104
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
pvp is it just that

2105
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
the balance is crazy

2106
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,000
because I think that

2107
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
people kind of embrace

2108
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
the crazy balance in

2109
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
diablo pvp but that's

2110
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
where I think I would

2111
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,000
start the discussion

2112
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
thanks for the

2113
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,000
answer

2114
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
that's fair

2115
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
when it comes to

2116
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
these questions

2117
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,000
these rapid fire

2118
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
requests and we got

2119
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,000
them from chat

2120
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and from youtube

2121
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and one of the

2122
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
questions that we

2123
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
wanted us to ask

2124
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
was how can we see

2125
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,000
how long people have

2126
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
been offline in our

2127
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
clients

2128
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
client management

2129
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
issues currently

2130
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
yeah yeah yeah

2131
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm not involved

2132
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,000
with that group so

2133
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I can't give it I

2134
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
actually don't know

2135
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
but I feel like

2136
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
that's very reasonable

2137
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I think we could

2138
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
bring that back to

2139
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,000
the team pretty

2140
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
easily I will say

2141
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
we do have a team

2142
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
that works on like

2143
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
UX issues user

2144
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
experience issues

2145
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
and they are the

2146
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
ones that kind of

2147
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,000
look at stuff like

2148
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
that like you know

2149
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
the ideas that we get

2150
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
over like group

2151
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,000
party finder or

2152
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
armory party finder

2153
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
this type of support

2154
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,000
we have a team

2155
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
that's looking at it

2156
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I know that they're

2157
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,000
working on stuff

2158
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
but I actually don't

2159
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
have complete insight

2160
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,000
into what they're

2161
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
doing but that seems

2162
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
very reasonable to me

2163
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
stuff I like it

2164
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
the next question is

2165
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
actually about pets

2166
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,000
in game and we're

2167
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
talking about non

2168
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
combat pets

2169
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
ranging from

2170
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
cosmetics to

2171
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
maybe loot pets

2172
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
that might only loot

2173
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
gold or something

2174
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,000
is that something

2175
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
that's been discussed

2176
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
if so what can you

2177
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,000
share

2178
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
we have discussed it

2179
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I think it'd be cool

2180
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,000
don't have anything

2181
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
to share

2182
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
all right

2183
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
next question would

2184
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
be so sorry

2185
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
go on I was just

2186
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
going to read the

2187
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,000
next one

2188
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
all right it's just

2189
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
DPS meter and

2190
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,000
dummies I would love

2191
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
to see that because

2192
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
you can't really see

2193
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,000
it when you have a

2194
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
minion army hitting a

2195
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
dummy I'd like to

2196
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
have DPS meters

2197
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
is that something

2198
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,000
we're going to see

2199
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
in the future

2200
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
yeah I think it's

2201
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
cool don't have

2202
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
anything to announce

2203
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
fair enough

2204
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
yeah but I'm

2205
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
actually thinking a

2206
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,000
little bit more about

2207
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
that and maybe

2208
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
feedback would be

2209
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
useful of like is it

2210
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,000
really only on

2211
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
dummies that you

2212
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,000
want to do it to

2213
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
test builds or would

2214
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
you want to see it in

2215
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
the rest of the game

2216
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
DPS meters are kind of

2217
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
notorious and other

2218
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,000
game types but I'm not

2219
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
sure that we have the

2220
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
same problems sure of

2221
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
people being upset with

2222
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,000
each other for not

2223
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
doing as much damage and

2224
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
all that kind of stuff

2225
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
but fair enough I feel

2226
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,000
like it'd probably be

2227
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
fine or at least for a

2228
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
personal one I know

2229
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
this one's probably like

2230
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
you can't go anywhere

2231
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
with this but offline

2232
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
mode is there any

2233
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
potential for an

2234
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
offline mode in Diablo

2235
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
4 at any point I have

2236
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,000
not heard any

2237
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
discussions about it I

2238
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
would I would doubt

2239
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
it okay I think that

2240
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
one I think I'm a

2241
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
little more sure I

2242
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
could say but I don't

2243
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,000
see it on the horizon

2244
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
but fair enough so I'm

2245
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
not in charge of those

2246
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,000
kinds of decisions

2247
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
glyph leveling and

2248
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
quality of life is there

2249
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
any potential for glyph

2250
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
leveling outside of

2251
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
nightmare dungeons are

2252
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000
we going to add

2253
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
experience to glyphs

2254
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,000
elsewhere in the game

2255
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
we've talked about it a

2256
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
bit nothing to announce

2257
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I think kind of going

2258
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
back to the idea with

2259
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
hell tides and and

2260
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
whispers I think it is

2261
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
cool to have a less

2262
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
efficient way to do

2263
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000
something while you're

2264
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
being efficient doing

2265
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
something else that's my

2266
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
personal opinion though

2267
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and kind of what I what I

2268
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
feel but I'm not on the

2269
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
systems team and don't

2270
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
know the nuances of

2271
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
glyph leveling specifically

2272
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
and why we keep it in one

2273
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
place but I I wouldn't be

2274
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
surprised I guess is what

2275
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I would say but I don't

2276
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
have a guarantee there

2277
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
how about things like

2278
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
surprise events like IE

2279
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
goblin vaults from D3 for

2280
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
example you get the ring

2281
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
you go to secondary you

2282
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
can pop out or you know

2283
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
pour those to other

2284
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
types of things any

2285
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
surprise ambush related

2286
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
event type of stuff we

2287
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
have the goblin packs for

2288
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,000
instance which is pretty

2289
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
cool in D4 rare but cool

2290
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
yeah well as I say we

2291
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
we've definitely we've

2292
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
added a couple in season

2293
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
four kind of mini events

2294
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
where like you have a

2295
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
chance when you kill an

2296
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
elite and it'll spawn into

2297
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
like a ton of gold or a

2298
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
ton of materials or things

2299
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
or give you way more than

2300
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
normal we like the idea of

2301
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
surprise events I think

2302
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
you can expect us to make

2303
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
more in the future that is

2304
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
one way kind of like what I

2305
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
think it was Gazi I think

2306
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
you said of like like we

2307
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
want to break up the

2308
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
monotony and we're trying

2309
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
to make sure that it feels

2310
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
different even though you're

2311
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
doing the same thing and I

2312
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
think surprise events is one

2313
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
of the ways that we do

2314
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
that sometimes it's more

2315
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
successful than others but

2316
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
it's definitely something

2317
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
that we want to continue to

2318
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
chase because we think

2319
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
overall it's good it's just

2320
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
about how exactly to

2321
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
implement it that's fair

2322
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
what's the team's position

2323
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
on support bills like back

2324
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
in D3 we have CDPS

2325
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
demon hunters and barb style

2326
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
bills do they have a place in

2327
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
D4 moving forward

2328
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
that's a good question

2329
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I think so but we have to

2330
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
be careful we were a lot

2331
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
more scared about it when we

2332
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
launched the game I remember

2333
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
people kept asking like Adam

2334
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
can we make more support

2335
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
builds make more things

2336
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
like cross synergy is really

2337
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
cool and I agree it's cool

2338
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
the the other side of that

2339
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
is kind of that that issue

2340
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
we deal with forever of

2341
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
group versus solo play is

2342
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
that the better we make a

2343
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
support build the more we're

2344
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,000
saying the best way to play

2345
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
this game is to go with

2346
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
four people support your

2347
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,000
friends and you get

2348
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
multiplicative massively

2349
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
increased amounts of

2350
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
output right so I think we

2351
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
do want we do want it we

2352
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
have it a little bit with

2353
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
barbarian shouts right and

2354
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
we've even had added some

2355
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
legendaries that do it like

2356
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
there's a druid one that

2357
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
turns your blood howl into an

2358
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
AOE buff but I don't think

2359
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
it's it's one of those you

2360
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
have to walk the line very

2361
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
carefully I think because it

2362
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
can be very detrimental to the

2363
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
game if we go too far but I'm

2364
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
not against it as an idea at

2365
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
all okay I'll jump over to

2366
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
the next one real quick with

2367
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
the opening community events

2368
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
way back like blizzard aq

2369
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
openings in World of Warcraft

2370
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
for example community designs

2371
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
a legendary any sort of that

2372
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
community events surrounding

2373
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
those things what are your

2374
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
thoughts on that I think it'd

2375
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
be awesome I'm not against it

2376
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
at all but those are checks

2377
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
that I can't cash so yeah I

2378
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
would love to I'm not going to

2379
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
make it but yes I would love

2380
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
an aq event like that in in

2381
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
d4 or something or even

2382
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
community making the lead

2383
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
community making a legendary

2384
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
oh how scared am I of that

2385
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
or unique I don't know

2386
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
probably but we can find a

2387
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,000
way to balance it I don't

2388
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
know I think it'd be cool I

2389
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
think it'd be neat yeah I'm

2390
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
on board I'm gonna throw you

2391
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
a quick one with something

2392
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
that's close to my heart and

2393
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
that's map overlay and before

2394
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
you say immersion I'd like to

2395
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
say that a lot of people will

2396
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
say let us play the game we

2397
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
want to what's the thoughts of

2398
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
map overlay moving forward

2399
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:55,000
this is personal Adam Adam

2400
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
thoughts not company thoughts

2401
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
because everybody has different

2402
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
opinions I think and we've

2403
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
talked about map overlay

2404
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
internally quite a bit I think

2405
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
map overlay it's one of those

2406
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,000
where there's there's such

2407
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
obvious pros and cons and I

2408
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
think different types of

2409
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
players really really want to

2410
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
engage in different ways I I

2411
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
personally am not completely

2412
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
against a map overlay being in

2413
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
the game but I understand why

2414
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
there there are people that

2415
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
feel strongly that you know we

2416
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
really don't want to try and

2417
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
make a game where you're

2418
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
looking at your map the whole

2419
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
time and not all this beautiful

2420
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
world and art and things that

2421
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
we've created to try and

2422
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
immerse the player and then

2423
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
they're so into the systems and

2424
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
the efficiency game that we

2425
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
pull them out of it and I

2426
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
think it kind of goes back to

2427
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
kind of what you said of like

2428
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
you know ARPGs we really want

2429
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
you to we know it's an

2430
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
efficiency game but we don't

2431
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
want it to feel that exposed all

2432
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
the time that you must feel

2433
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
pressure to do things

2434
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
perfectly all the time and a

2435
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
map overlay pushes that pretty

2436
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
hard so I see both sides I think

2437
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm a little bit personally in

2438
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
favor of just having it because

2439
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
people want it but I understand

2440
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
it changes the game pretty

2441
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
fundamentally for a lot of

2442
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
people and there's a pressure

2443
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
there now it's kind of like

2444
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
DPS meters in many games too I

2445
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
would equate it to like the

2446
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
moment you introduce that you

2447
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
kind of can't go back and you've

2448
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
changed how people interact with

2449
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
your game forever and so I even

2450
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
if people want it I I see why

2451
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
it it's a tough topic we're

2452
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
actually doing pretty good on

2453
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
time we're almost through the

2454
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
rapid fire we just got a few

2455
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
more here and then we pretty

2456
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
much are GG out the way out the

2457
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
door here so ultimate button

2458
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,000
is something that gets brought up

2459
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
a lot people have asked can we

2460
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
get a separate button for the

2461
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:37,000
ultimate yeah maybe I'll say I'll

2462
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
explain the problem space of why

2463
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
yeah so when we're thinking

2464
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
about Diablo and why we don't

2465
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
have more extra buttons or like

2466
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
an ultimate button or whatever

2467
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
is that we we we thought heavily

2468
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
and work long and hard deciding the

2469
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,000
number of buttons that you're

2470
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
going to have total on your bar at

2471
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
all and those buttons were

2472
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
determined by thinking of how many

2473
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
different actions do we want a

2474
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
player to worry about at any given

2475
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
time and right now we have you

2476
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
know you have a Vage you have

2477
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
potion you have your regular ones

2478
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
on your bar and then your core

2479
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
and your basic right if you have a

2480
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
basic adding another button is

2481
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
something that we could do I mean

2482
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
controller issues aside and making

2483
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
that feel good it's a matter of how

2484
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
complex do we want to expect every

2485
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
single player to interact and at the

2486
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
time at launching the game we we

2487
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
wrestled back and forth with this a

2488
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
lot and our at the at the time our

2489
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
idea was we would rather have

2490
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
something like an evade button that

2491
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
really everybody can use and makes

2492
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
the game feel very different and it's

2493
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
kind of like this is very different

2494
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
than other RPGs than a specific

2495
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
ultimate button there's also would

2496
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
need to be a lot of rebalancing of

2497
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
ultimates when we fully expect

2498
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
people to have one versus that they

2499
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
can choose whether or not they do

2500
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
that work we could do I think it's

2501
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
more of like do I want to balance and

2502
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
design everything assuming a player

2503
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
has an ultimate in addition to all

2504
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
of their other skills and what that

2505
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
means to how we have to change

2506
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
ultimates or do other things I think

2507
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
it's doable but I don't know that I'm

2508
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
very excited about the prospect unless

2509
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
there's a very clear win okay can

2510
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
understand that a couple just fast

2511
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
ones I have to go in depth on just

2512
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
some transmog things people are

2513
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
asking maybe a color wheel for

2514
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
transmogs as opposed to just like

2515
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
red green blue any thoughts on

2516
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
adding like a color wheel yeah it

2517
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
seems cool it's not my team but yeah

2518
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
non-horse mounts pretty much all the

2519
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
mounts are horses can we get like a

2520
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
maggot or anything spider I think I

2521
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
think we should and I wouldn't be

2522
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
surprised if we did it but I'm not

2523
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
involved in those conversations but I

2524
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
think I personally feel like it's a

2525
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
no-brainer yeah same same I agree I'm

2526
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
glad I agree on okay wings kind of

2527
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
controversial but a million people

2528
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
asked me wings are we ever gonna see

2529
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
wings in the port yeah that's a little

2530
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
more controversial I would say I

2531
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
don't know about the future I can

2532
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
explain a little bit of where we're at

2533
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
now and I'm not even completely

2534
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
involved in this is a little bit of

2535
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
my opinion because I didn't make

2536
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
these decisions but you know return to

2537
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
darkness was one of our big guiding

2538
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
philosophies when we when we were

2539
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
making d4 up to launch and this idea

2540
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
that hey this game is is you know going

2541
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
back to kind of d1 d2 roots of being

2542
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
scary and and a little more you know

2543
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
gruesome and dark and dreary and we even

2544
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
try even with the combat that's why we

2545
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
have evade is like you have to dodge

2546
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
attacks and really plan because this

2547
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
world is dangerous in some ways we've

2548
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
learned that players you know want to

2549
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
blast and they don't care as much as we

2550
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
maybe we like we over indexed a little

2551
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
bit on it we still but it is still

2552
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
something that we care about so like

2553
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
now it's does we like before wings was

2554
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
kind of in that it's making the game a

2555
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
little bit it doesn't fit the vibe we're

2556
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
going for but we've moved a bit but

2557
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
have we moved enough that wings are

2558
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
okay now I don't know fair enough I'm

2559
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
it's like we're I think we're right

2560
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
there I could I could see it being

2561
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
either way but that just explains kind

2562
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
of how we got here so fair enough I

2563
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
get that we only got like three

2564
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
questions left here really so the last

2565
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
transmog related or cosmetic related

2566
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
question is can we get cosmetics

2567
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
potentially for minions I know

2568
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Ghazi probably would like this one

2569
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I think it would be cool it's a lot

2570
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
harder to do for minions and for

2571
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
players though or even like wings

2572
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
because you can have a million

2573
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
minions on your screen and how loud

2574
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
that is is a concern but I don't think

2575
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
it's an impossibility I'd like to see

2576
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
it I think it'd be cool same with

2577
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Jura transform transmogs I think

2578
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
would be cool but that's just my

2579
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
opinion all right go for it Ghazi

2580
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
speaking of being scary what about a

2581
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
unicorn level cow level is that ever

2582
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
something that's going to happen

2583
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
because we've all been hunting for it

2584
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
a unicorn level that sounds neat I

2585
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
don't know what you're talking about

2586
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
with the other one there it is and

2587
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
shout out to racks uber tomb lord win

2588
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I think it'd be cool I'm down I don't

2589
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
know whatever people want to fight I

2590
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
mean we could make it all right and we

2591
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
pretty much are hitting the end of the

2592
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
time here I want to thank you for your

2593
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
time I will submit there's a couple

2594
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
other there like bug reports that I'll

2595
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
just DM over as well and we skip those

2596
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
ones and you know we just had our 45

2597
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
minutes so I appreciate the time thanks

2598
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
for answering all the questions and we

2599
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
actually managed to get through pretty

2600
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
much the entire list including the

2601
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
rapid fire so you've done good I

2602
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
appreciate it you know any last words

2603
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
anything you want to say

2604
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
um I would say you know first thanks

2605
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
to both of you for taking the time to

2606
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
talk to me you know we really enjoy

2607
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
these conversations I look forward to

2608
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
doing more um for everybody else you

2609
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
know one of the things I'm really

2610
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
passionate about like first you know go

2611
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
listen to that convert that to that

2612
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
presentation that I talked about on a

2613
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
curse problems I really one of my goals

2614
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
with getting in front of people and

2615
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
talking with them and I've done this

2616
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
ever since I started as a developer you

2617
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
can go look at interviews with me years

2618
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
ago from heroes but I like having

2619
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
better discussions with you all and with

2620
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
players that are a little more

2621
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
informed so as people get passionate

2622
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
want to learn about game design you

2623
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
know it's easy just to be like hey

2624
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
why don't you add this and we can

2625
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
answer those questions but I like more

2626
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
in-depth ones and we do on the team

2627
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
of like hey why does this work the way

2628
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
it does and can we find a way to make

2629
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
it work and get what we want right like

2630
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
when you counter back at me with like

2631
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
the strongholds question like can't we

2632
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
okay Adam I listen to you I understand

2633
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
your problem space now that I've

2634
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
thought about it can we do this and

2635
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
why or why not like that to me is a

2636
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
better discussion and a better

2637
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
culture a better a better world really

2638
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
if I want to get sappy of like you

2639
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
know be informed when talking about

2640
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
things and care about it and think

2641
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
about it and don't just blast like hey

2642
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
just do this right yeah I mean I

2643
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
wouldn't want to answer those either

2644
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I felt like I would yeah I'm not

2645
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
saying everyone has to be a game dev I

2646
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
just mean like if you care enough to

2647
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
really want to know like you know

2648
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
think about it and have real

2649
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
discussions and so I want to be a

2650
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
force for that I guess in the community

2651
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and I think other people on our team

2652
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
do as well so thanks yeah but I

2653
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
really enjoyed the time so enjoy

2654
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
talking with you both I enjoyed it

2655
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
it was it was actually nice seeing the

2656
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
thought process behind it and then

2657
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
like it kind of in real time because

2658
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
normally it's like you make a video

2659
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
maybe you get a response about it or

2660
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
something but it is kind of nice to

2661
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
see like in real time the feedback

2662
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
because you're right just during the

2663
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
very brief conversation about strong

2664
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
codes like it did actually I'm like

2665
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
oh you know it makes sense it's a

2666
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
consumable design thing kind of hard

2667
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
to turn into a repetitive Xerre so

00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
