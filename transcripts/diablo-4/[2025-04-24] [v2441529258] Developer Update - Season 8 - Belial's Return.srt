00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, Diablo community.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome to another Diablo 4 Developer Update Livestream.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
My name is Adam Fletcher, Community Director here for Diablo,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and I am joined by some very familiar faces here,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and they will introduce themselves.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hi, I'm Colin Feiner.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm the Design Director for Systems on Diablo 4.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hey, I'm Derek Nunez.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm the Lead Seasons Designer for Season 8 here on Diablo 4.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hi, I'm Charles Dunn.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm a Class Designer working on the final design team on Diablo.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Awesome. Well, we have a full crew here today.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We're actually going to be talking a ton today about Season 8.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I know we had a Season 8 PTR livestream.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're going to talk a little bit about some of the same content

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that was in there just because some people may have not tuned in for that.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But it's a quick recap of what Season 8 is.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We announced it earlier this week on our blogs and on Diablo4.com.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So if you haven't checked out any of the trailers and stuff like that,

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
most definitely do so.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to fight my earpiece this whole entire stream.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I can already tell.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So if you see me fidgeting with my ear, I apologize.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But we are also going to talk about PTR changes that are coming to Season 8.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We got a ton of feedback from the Season 8 PTR.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And we want to make sure that we talk through all those specific items

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
with the community.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Likewise, we're also going to talk a little bit about some class updates

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and balance updates and PTR changes based off of that.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And Colin's going to walk us through some system updates that are coming in for Diablo 4.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We'll do a quick overview on Reliquaries, which is a new system that will start with Season 8

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and be permanent going forward.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then, of course, we will round it up with our Q&A.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So we'll jump right in straight into Season 8 content.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, Derek, do you want to talk to us a little bit about Season 8 with Belial returning?

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, absolutely.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, Season 8, Belial Returns is the continuation of the Age of Hatred

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
where Mephisto is walking the Land of Sanctuary, creating the perfect opportunity

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that Belial, the Lord of Lies and one of the great evils, has been waiting for

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to make his resurgence back into the land to continue his never-ending plan

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
to plunge the denizens of Sanctuary into the Realm of Lies

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
where he maintains soul dominance over perceptions of reality.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, not a great demon that you want, kind of like roaming around Sanctuary,

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
but throughout the course of the season, we'll be meeting a couple of new allies

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
that will be joining our little ragtag group here.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, first up is, drumroll, there you go, Syena.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
On the left here is a retired Vizurai mage who you meet right at the beginning

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
of the Season 8 questline.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She kind of clues you in to all like the weird happenings that are going on

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
in Sanctuary at this time and that her suspicions are that Belial's behind it.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Spoiler alert, it's called Season 8, Belial Returns, so she ends up being right.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes, Belial has infiltrated Sanctuary.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm actually going to pause you really quickly, Derek.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, sure.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm just going to make sure our production team can hear it or may be adjusting some volume

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
because I think some people in chat are not able to hear.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, if we're good, okay, we're good.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
All right, sorry.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, sweet.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Go ahead.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There we go.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All right, Belial returns if you missed that.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah, so on the left here, Syena is a ex-Vigiri mage who clues you into, you know,

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
these odd happenings that are going on in Sanctuary and she suspects that Belial is behind it.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Again, kind of spoiler alert, he is because Belial returns and he's back in Sanctuary.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You'll also be getting acquainted with Jarius on the right here who claims to be a former Cathedral of Light Knight

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
who kind of throughout the course you find that he's kind of dealing with his own kind of internal struggles

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and past traumas.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So, collectively, this ragtag group will be engaging in kind of a cat and mouse chase,

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
race against time to put a stop to Belial before he's allowed to even regain a single, like,

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
shred of power back in Sanctuary.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
For players who know Belial and kind of his past works, from Diablo III specifically,

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Belial likes to work into shadows and, you know, infiltrate society and kind of manipulate, you know,

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
again from behind the scenes.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So, fans might know already what kind of dangers and turmoil can happen when Belial is even allowed

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
to regain full dominance in Sanctuary.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Like, in Diablo III, he overtook the city of Chaldean when he was impersonating Emperor Haakanda II.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He cast that entire city into economic and political turmoil.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He even, you know, kind of exiled the Iron Wolves, the once, you know, kind of highly regarded

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Guardians of Chaldean into, you know, out of the city, rendering them to be the, you know,

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the current exiled, disgraced militia group that they are now in the events of Diablo IV.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So, if you happen by the Iron Wolf encampment, just give them a pat on the back.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It wasn't their fault. It was all Belial's doing.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But yeah, that's a, you know, high-level overview of kind of, you know, the questline that we'll be embarking on

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that reintroduces Belial permanently into the world of Sanctuary.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And with that, you know, that's all the new stuff that we did not cover in the previous stream,

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but we have the blog posts out and all that kind of stuff.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But I want to cover the stuff that kind of retread some things that we covered before

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
that went into the PTR and kind of end each segment with the PTR learnings

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
to kind of keep it structured and fresh here.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So, as we know, Season 8 is the season of bosses, more specifically, Lair bosses.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, through this, we're, you know, adding new bosses to the roster, updating it with new mechanics,

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and hitting it with a whole bevy of quality of life updates.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, again, as a bit of a recap, first and foremost, as far as the new bosses are concerned,

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
we have our buddy Belial here in a supreme form joining the very tippity top of the Lair boss ladder.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He's the new, you know, biggest battle ladder, the most toughest, the most rewarding,

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and he's overlooking the rest of the bosses and also bringing a couple of new buddies to join the party.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
First up is Urovar from our Vessel of Hatred expansion, where he is joining the bottom rung of the ladder,

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
you know, tier one boss, and he's also being joined with the Harbinger of Hatred,

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
who is filling out the second rung of the ladder.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, again, collectively, we have a new boss roster additions of Belial in his supreme form at the top,

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Harbinger of Hatred just below him, and Urovar kind of guarding the gates on the ground floor.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So, collectively, these are all the new bosses that are joining, and these are all ones that we actually had in the PTR,

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
so I'm excited to kind of share some updates we've made since then.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But that is not it for Belial stuff.

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We also have Belial in his smaller form, as we might know for players who play the PTR,

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that he is now kind of haunting and stalking the Lair boss ladder just through and through.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, again, defeating any of the Lair bosses has a percent chance to trigger a surprise small Belial ambush spawn

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to kind of give you double the loot, double the fun.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So, yeah, that's, again, kind of a bit of a recap of the Lair boss updates, the rosters that we had to the system,

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and kind of just want to chat a little bit about some of the PTR findings that we had from that.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, again, first up, we had all the bosses in there, and we gathered a bunch of great feedback over kind of just the general tuning.

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We also updated all of the existing Lair bosses with new abilities and whatnot.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So, I guess the first and foremost, you know, kind of like change that we made since the PTR is just refine the balance on the Supreme Form of Belial.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know, we had some feedback and also felt it ourselves that he wasn't hitting as hard as he could or kind of representing his proper status on the ladder.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So, he has been buffed up quite tremendously and also received a few new tricks up his sleeve.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Additionally, all of the Lair bosses themselves have received, you know, again, refined some of their attack mechanics to cut down on some of the one-shots that we were seeing,

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and just generally, just general balancing to get them more representative of the respective tier that they kind of belong in.

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, we kind of overcorrected on the damage in PTR just to test out. We had removed the stacking debuff that the Lair bosses had done,

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and it was just sort of up to us in terms of what attacks actually applied that debuff, and we felt like it was disrespecting players' defenses.

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, we stripped that out, but then buffed the damage a little bit too much for PTR, and we've since pulled back on some of the one-shots there.

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah. So, yeah, you know, when Season 8 launches proper, all the bosses should be feeling much more appropriate within their respective tiers,

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and also appropriate for the rewards that they give, you know, for the effort that players are putting into that journey to get to the top.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah. Definitely. I think we also sort of took a look at the material tuning and the overall reward of a lot of the Lair bosses from the PTR.

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So, in general, we're taking an approach where globally sort of just across the game, like when you kill elites and things like that,

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
we're bringing the materials, the material drops are being reduced, but we're actually buffing the materials from the specific activities that you need to do to actually gain these materials.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Right. And we're also taking a look, we had taken a look at the boss drops actually in totality from PTR, and we've buffed it.

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So, a good example now is that Supreme Blow is actually going to drop two Ancestrals as opposed to the one from PTR,

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and we're just really sort of trying to chase after the philosophy of the bosses are something that you're going to do periodically.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah. It's going to be a big challenge, but they're going to be more rewarding than they were on PTR.

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We think that that's a better place to be in as opposed to like the hour-long chain farming that you were doing in the previous seasons of these bosses.

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah. We really like encouraging this like diversity of endgame activities where you're doing lots of different activities that feed you into the boss ladder,

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and then fighting these bosses, taking them down and looting them is really a high moment that you get every once in a while.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But it's not something we really want, oh, you're just going to chain bosses nonstop and that's all you do.

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We really want to encourage that diversity of endgame activities.

137
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah. Yeah. And just to make the spread a little bit better, if you think about season seven, you might, for example, want Fists of Fate.

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So you'd only fight Beast and Ice, and that's the only boss you'd ever do.

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So what we've done actually, and this was in the PTR, but I just wanted to cover it because I think it's an important note,

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
is now all the bosses half and half split their loot. So half is targeted, half is global.

141
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So that means you still have a reason to do all of the bosses, and that just makes experiencing the variety of activities that we have in Diablo 4 just a little bit more rewarding.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There's always a boss at the end journey of any given activity in the game.

143
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah. And anyway, with that, it's a great thing that, you know, Belial got buffed up in his drops too,

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
because as you recall, for those who play the PTR, you can actually target farm the specific, mimic the specific layer boss loot that you want him to kind of drop for you.

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's exactly right.

146
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So cool. Yeah, that's a bit of a recap and some of the PTR findings.

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And let's jump into kind of covering the next section here, which is the lair keys.

148
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So again, for those who play the PTR, you experience that we've entirely, we've changed up entirely the full, you know, summoning and reward flow of the lair boss system.

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So all of the first, I guess the first foremost one is that all of the bosses are now free to summon,

150
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and the items that were formerly known as the summoning items, to summon them up, are now living a new life and role as lair keys.

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think we have a bit of a graphic here to kind of show.

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, I really like this change of making the bosses free to summon.

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It lets you really test your build against these, these bosses, because we are like ramping the difficulty, right?

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The initiate lair bosses, a little bit easier to take down, and they definitely ramp up in difficulty as you go up that ladder.

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And so if you're not sure, like, hey, am I able to take on this boss, get it in the torment tier that you're in,

156
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you kind of have to, you can get in there with no investment, right?

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're not going to commit your resources and then find out, oh, this boss is way too hard for me.

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You can go and you fight them. And then if you're able to take them down, you can use those to unlock the loot.

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And I think that's just a much better user experience all the way through.

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah, absolutely. And kind of, you know, one of the, again, kind of a reminder here with this nice, very fancy chart, looks gorgeous,

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
is just kind of streamlining how players gain access and kind of climb the ladder.

162
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So as we might recall from the PTR, we reduced the total number of lair keys required to gather open the horde chest that the bosses now drop upon death.

163
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
From two to one, they stack up to 99.

164
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And one of the neat things is kind of like encouraging players engage in a wide variety of bosses is all the initiate lair,

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
or I guess initiate tiered lair bosses will not just drop the associated key for the next boss that they're kind of linked to,

166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
but they're also, all of them can drop a Stygian stone, which is also living a new world that it can be crushed to turn into the lair key for any of the greater lair bosses.

167
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And again, as I mentioned before, any of the initiate or greater lair bosses has a chance to get the surprise Belial ambush,

168
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,000
which is the key to get the betrayer's husk to loot his supreme forms, you know, his supreme forms a horde.

169
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So yeah, again, all roads kind of like lead to Belial.

170
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And again, kind of this is a recap here.

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
We have the full flow in action that you can just kind of remind yourself here.

172
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I think we got some gameplay, I believe.

173
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There you go.

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So again, here we are with the summoning pedestal.

175
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Again, no materials required for the cost.

176
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And we're going to summon up the Harbinger of Hatred here.

177
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Again, our new tier two lair boss.

178
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And we don't want to spoil the mechanics of this really kind of cool fight.

179
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But, you know, players who played in the PTR got to experience it.

180
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And we're just going to jump ahead here to opening up the horde and getting the loot.

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, and I think something you might notice is that we've actually tuned a lot of the material costs on the chest.

182
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So in PTR, it was actually four, now it's three.

183
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So we've reduced the cost of opening the greater lair boss chests.

184
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I also want to acknowledge, like, this definitely is a nerf to chain farming.

185
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's something that I think has been a result of this change.

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And frankly, I think that's something that feels a little bit more appropriate to the overall game.

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We didn't like that how you could sort of just drop into any party and get a bunch of uniques for free.

188
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We feel like you need to work for some of the loot in Diablo, right?

189
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If we don't have you do some challenges and work for things, the reward isn't as sweet, right?

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's sort of like walking that fine line between just challenging enough and just rewarding enough that it feels right and not too slow that it feels like a slog or not too easy that it just feels pointless.

191
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Like, why do we even have this in the game?

192
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So to sort of compensate that, that's why we've done a bunch of buffs to the overall loot of these lair bosses from the PTR.

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So again, like, Ike Bilal is dropping too.

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We've increased the just baseline uniques that drop off of the lair boss hoards in addition to Bilal sometimes showing up and actually doubling your loot.

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So we think this strikes a better balance for social party play as well as solo players.

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And overall, we think this is just a better and healthier journey to actually getting to more power.

197
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You actually have to work a little bit more for it.

198
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, you know, you kind of covered in previous like the general kind of spread of the PTR updates we've done since.

199
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But one of the feedbacks we got from kind of like the new loop and flow of the horde and the summoning material was that, you know, players felt that there was a bit too long of a delay before they can get back to the boss.

200
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So would you like take the honors of this really cool update?

201
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, sure.

202
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So we have this wait time.

203
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It was essentially for parties to go back to town and maybe manage the loot.

204
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It was about 20 or 30 seconds, but 20 or 30 seconds and Diablo is a fucking eternity.

205
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So we took it out essentially like how we've mitigated it.

206
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Mitigated is if anyone if the parties all open the chest, we'll just skip the timer and that includes solo.

207
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So if you just open it up, we'll just skip the timer.

208
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You'll you're back to blasting.

209
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So, yeah.

210
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah.

211
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So the next bit here was the apparition incursions that again, this is a new seasonal, but everything I just covered there is all the way that we're going to do.

212
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So the thing I just covered there is all the permanent updates to that we're introducing to Diablo 4 within season eight.

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But back to some of the seasonal fun stuff.

214
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Players who engage in the PTR might recall that we introduced the apparition incursions, which is a fast paced boss rush event where players will be going through kind of like blasting through hordes of blaze apparition monsters to fight through some bosses and, you know, kind of ultimately go into a final showdown against him.

215
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I think we have some of the footage to check out here with it as kind of a bit of a refresher.

216
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So again, this is an open world activity that is pretty much up 24 seven.

217
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You know, the kind of goal for this is that players would, you know, hop on the train, blast through some bosses, collect some of your first boss powers and then, you know, fight Belial.

218
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But I do want to cover some of the again, this is meant to be kind of a very fast paced, streamlined, simple event that is meant to kind of mix in with the wider pantheon of level up activities that we have.

219
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So I do want to cover some of the PTR updates that we've made since then that should, you know, have this a bit more cleanly into, you know, kind of where it should be fitting within the level of activities.

220
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So the first bit from this, as far as the PTR is concerned, is we've rebalanced the role a bit of the operation and courage.

221
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
All these names of the operation and courage. And so one of the feedbacks that we got from the PTR was that there was some concern over its long term reward and whatnot.

222
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So the first thing that we've updated since then was introduced a whisper bounty now.

223
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So every now and again, you know, you get the whisper bounty and that's kind of like a call to action to come back to the, you know, the boss train and get those get those whispers.

224
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
As far as the balancing is concerned, you know, one of the primary roles that we kind of saw in the PTR for the operation and courage is one giving you your

225
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
first batch of, you know, magic grade boss powers, but also earning the spectral ash that you need to level them up.

226
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So there's definitely some feedback that we felt and received that getting enough spectral ash through the apparition incursion is a bit of a slog.

227
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Like it requires too much of the player's intention or time rather.

228
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And it just is not representative of the amount of time that we necessarily want players to feel like they have to invest into just playing the apparition incursion.

229
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So one we've reduced the spectral ash requirements to upgrade your magic and I think a rare grade boss powers.

230
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So you need less of it, but we've also buffed the amount of spectral ash that you get from the layer bosses.

231
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So collectively the goal for this is that when you log into season eight, you know, the apparition incursion is there for kind of the new novelty to get you your powers kind of get you acclimated to earning spectral ash.

232
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But it's not necessarily there to dominate your full attention.

233
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We want you to engage in the wider pantheon again as level up activities.

234
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So we want you to do apparition incursions, you know, take a break and do the hell tides and nightmare dungeons.

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's kind of experience the variety of the content to better set you up for when you enter the torment tiers where we're really expecting players to, you know, do all the torment stuff and engage with the lair bosses to really amplify their boss power collections and leveling them up.

236
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, we really made a lot of these changes from PTR to position it more to help level you pre torment pre endgame.

237
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So we boosted the XP through the whispers.

238
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We also added XP to the bosses that you'll kill in those events.

239
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And we're also through the combination of lowering the cost of upgrading some of the early boss powers.

240
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We really want to position this in a place where it's sort of a fast track through the leveling experience and it's a place to go.

241
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And we want there sort of to be a handoff to torment in the endgame where you like you said, we have to you have to sort of start to do other activities in the game.

242
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Something we saw from season seven that we kind of want to address and change for this season to see how it feels is season seven head hunts just dominated the entire game from start to finish.

243
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And it felt like there wasn't really a transition to an endgame or anything more meaningful or wider.

244
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The game sort of shrunk we felt like instead of growing bigger.

245
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's fun till it's not.

246
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's fun till it's not right.

247
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah.

248
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And we sort of tuned the reputation and like the sort of head hunt currency that you needed a little bit too aggressively in terms of needing you to actually play through that too much.

249
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So we're taking a different step or a different approach here.

250
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yeah.

251
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And that's where the apparition incursions are like not definitely not intending for it to kind of dominate your full attention again.

252
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's there as kind of that fun activity to get you going.

253
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And also when you do graduate into the torment tears due to the addition of the whisper bounties on it, you know, you'll pull you back every now and again when when it's a super valuable for you.

254
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:28,000
All right. Cool. So the next bit here is I want to talk about the boss powers that we had into the PTR again as kind of a quick quick recap here.

255
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You know through the season early quest beat you kind of gain the ability to steal the powers of targeted bosses across sanctuaries content.

256
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This is 24 of them in total starting off with the apparition bosses then the world bosses and then the lair bosses Lilith and then Belial who gets two powers for himself because it's his season and he wants two powers for himself.

257
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So who are we to say no to him?

258
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But yeah, I think we have some things kind of just kind of recap some of the powers here.

259
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So here's the the boss power screen and as kind of a recap here, each of the powers have two sides to it.

260
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:16,000
A main and a modifier side. You can slot one main side which is actually will allow you to do the full expression of that signature move.

261
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You know whether it be the Lilith wave blast or the Durial burrow which we'll probably see in a second here.

262
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But you can also every boss power also has a side B the modifier side which allows you to further customize and augment your total expression of you know being the boss essentially.

263
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
We like kind of call it customizable you know boss powers and stuff.

264
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So again this is the Lilith wave blast that you'll get from the first time kill of defeating Lilith.

265
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This is the Durial burrow which would be a lot of fun. This one procs off of the evade. So really fun for kind of the twitchy mobile builds.

266
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Also just kind of fun just to see a big bear burrow under the air.

267
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Sneaky werebearers huh?

268
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah.

269
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And this one that's super easy to miss is the wandering death laser beam.

270
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What is it? Which where is it? I don't see it.

271
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't see it at all.

272
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Oh I think it's that little blue line.

273
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey did we move that closer?

274
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah we did. That is one of the big you know ground breaking updates from the PTR was that we did do some adjustments to the powers.

275
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Visual effects and whatnot like bringing the beam a little bit closer so it feels not so detached from the character especially the melee builds.

276
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It kind of felt fine for like the you know the casters that kind of feels like you're like shooting beams out from here.

277
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It looks great for those but you know some of the melee builds it kind of felt a little bit disjointed where you're a whirlwind barb and then kind of like a detached like beam coming across.

278
00:23:41,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So yeah we did bring those in and we you know I think this kind of sets up we received a ton of feedback about just the general balance of how much of your total players power expression should be pulled in from the boss powers versus your actual build itself.

279
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So this is where I get to hand.

280
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah I want to talk more about you know kind of the balancing we saw from from these boss powers on the PTR which is like so valuable as developers for us to get that feedback and and here you know see players testing these these powers and these builds and and really like letting us know what they feel about it.

281
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's really valuable to have that testing in specifically in regards to these these boss powers you know we what we really like about introducing new powers every season or see you know

282
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,000
in this season is how they really like tinker with your build you say like oh hey I'm playing this style of build and there's this boss power that synergizes really nice with it.

283
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It adds a little wrinkle to to the way you think about your character season over season and we love that that's really cool.

284
00:24:45,000 --> 00:25:00,000
One thing we heard on the PTR for this particular for these particular powers is that they were more than just a wrinkle they were your entire build right they were really overshadowing how much damage output you were doing and you didn't really feel like oh I'm a dance of

285
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
knives rogue you felt like you were a wandering death chest beam rogue that also happens to cast dance of knives every once in a while.

286
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
We want you to be the boss but not that much.

287
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Maybe not quite that much.

288
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It was definitely a little too far on the scale of like hey let's make these powerful and impactful.

289
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's definitely a fine line where we're trying to make sure that you you you notice them you feel them you they're an important part of your build but they're not your entire build.

290
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So we definitely swung a little too far there and so as updates from the from the PTR we looked at adjusting the scaling because these powers scale up in their damage output based on your paragon level.

291
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So the more you're you're kind of getting up into that late game you're you're raising your paragon level they're going to be kind of scaling with you because the rest of your damage is going up.

292
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And so we're increasing the damage there on the PTR they would previously scale with you all the way up to paragon level 300 which is very difficult to reach.

293
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You know it's a long grind get up there.

294
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Now we're capping them at paragon 200 which you think is a much more reasonable place to expect players to kind of get to to unlock that full expression of power.

295
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And even then we've reduced that the scaling amount so it's not quite as high as it will be.

296
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
We still expect them to be impactful to your build.

297
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We just don't want them to absolutely dominate everything else that you're doing.

298
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah, and this fits better like we sort of set up the paragon in such a way where you can get most of what you want around paragon 200 and the rest is sort of just gravy for people who just really want to push and grind.

299
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You're getting course that maybe some additive damage.

300
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
There's one that's sort of double down on next I think that's something that's really important to us is making sure that you don't feel obligated to get to that.

301
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You're still obligated to get to 300 and it's more just sort of a you know badassery.

302
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah, there were also a few specific powers that we decided to rework based on the way they were playing out on the PTR.

303
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Specifically and Daryl's flaming skull.

304
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The modifier on that one in the previous version was applying many burn effects.

305
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It actually made burning sorcerer builds way way too powerful.

306
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I believe something like 40 pit tiers higher than they really should be.

307
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
We like powerful effects but 40 pit tiers higher than you would otherwise have is was too much.

308
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So it's kind of been completely reworked here.

309
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's still very valuable for dot based builds those damage over times, but it's just got more multiplicative damage rather than kind of this exponentially growing the way it was before.

310
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Similarly with Ur of Arzlov bombs, we updated the cooldown reduction on it previously it was granting just a flat amount of cooldown reduction says your ultimate was reduced by I think a lot of cooldown reduction.

311
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:39,000
As we'll talk about a little bit later we found that we like that you get to spam your ultimates in some builds that was just empowering it a little too easily.

312
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And so we've adjusted it to be a flat 15% cooldown reduction rather than that like flat amount of five seconds off on the on the ultimates there.

313
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, and I think the spirit of a lot of this with the changes that we'll dive a little bit into in terms of making torment a little bit harder and some of the changes to these boss powers is really like we want progression to feel meaningful and challenging and something that you can work towards.

314
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We don't really like when some of these effects just sort of short circuit that entire journey and you slap it in and then now you're in tournament for and the game is done.

315
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, so it's really about trying to build that satisfying journey to becoming a god like we like that you can become a god and one shot stuff and Diablo is a power fantasy that that's what Diablo needs to do.

316
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But we don't like when it happens too frequently with blinking you miss it.

317
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah, it really cheapens the experience if you get if you find one item or one power and like oh games over now.

318
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Now what do I do right?

319
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's that we feel like we fail to deliver on that power fantasy if you get it too easily like you would occasionally get with some of these these other effects that we've adjusted.

320
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Definitely.

321
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Cool.

322
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, I think that wraps it up for season eight specific items.

323
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Related to well, I'll return Derek.

324
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm gonna say thanks to Charles and Colin as well though.

325
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I'm actually about to throw it back over to Charles, but thank you for running us through that again like all the changes that we're talking about from PTR and just a reminder on what PTR is PTR is our public test realm.

326
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That's something that we do before the actual season.

327
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
It's an opportunity for people to really test things.

328
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's kind of like our form of like early access you could say where people can jump in they can test specific things and then we can make changes for when the live season actually happens.

329
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So there are going to be additional PTR changes that we're going to be talking about because we're going to jump into classes again.

330
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm going to throw it back over to Charles and Charles will talk a little bit more of all the class changes that are coming with season eight.

331
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And of course the changes coming from PTR as well.

332
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, of course.

333
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So let's talk about, you know, just to carry on about some of the balancing philosophy around what we're looking at when we do these PTRs.

334
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Specifically from the class balance side, we're often looking at a lot of the new items, the new builds and the kind of the reworks that we've done to classes.

335
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Whenever we make a new season, we say, hey, we're going to target certain areas and like look at certain play styles of the class and really make sure those are hitting the mark.

336
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And so when we're looking at adjusting from the PTR to live, which is what we're going to talk about today, most of the changes are really targeted around the new content that's coming out or the new builds we're trying to target and empower to make sure they're really hitting the mark.

337
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That's not to say we don't appreciate feedback about the entire class or any other skill.

338
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's just that given the scope of what we're looking at from a PTR, we're trying to stay really focused on what we think will have the highest impact on the actual seasonal release.

339
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah. And part of this is to sort of respect some of the players who I know you all enjoy like theory crafting and building things up.

340
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We kind of want to make sure that that's like a stable thing that you can theory craft before a season launches.

341
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You get to see all the new changes and we're just going to sort of fine tune the things that we've already talked about.

342
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah, absolutely. We don't want to go, hey, here's a PTR and then completely upheaval everything as we go to launch.

343
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Right. We're just mainly looking at refining what we kind of set out to do in the season.

344
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Of course, what I'm going to be talking about for each class is really just a high level overview of the adjustments we're making, not every single one in detail.

345
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
In order to find out all the detail, you're gonna have to check out the patch notes, which should be going live later today, right after the stream.

346
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
All right. So let's hop into the first class, which will be barbarian.

347
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So for the barbarian, since the PTR, we really wanted to play up the barbarian fantasy of hitting enemies with your weapons.

348
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Right. We barbarians in the past have done a lot of earthquakes and dust devils, and that's really cool and really fun.

349
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But it does lead to a little bit of a disconnect between how, you know, the raw physicality of a barbarian.

350
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And so with that in mind, whirlwind in particular was one that was falling behind.

351
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And so it's got actually a really massive buff since PTR about a 60% increased base damage as well as upgrades to one of its upgrades that makes it the bleed that it applies is much more impactful now.

352
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And so really, if you're using whirlwind for whirlwind sake, it's going to be much more impactful.

353
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I love spend the win. Absolutely. It's a really fun, fun build on barbarian.

354
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I just wasn't hitting the mark. Hopefully now with all these buffs, it'll be much closer to being that competitive build.

355
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Kind of on the flip side, we've also adjusted executioner's aspect.

356
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This is a legendary that was really good for the earthquake builds, was one of the primary scalers there.

357
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
We have capped the scaling on that. Everyone knows earthquake barbarian was really good in season seven.

358
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That's what I personally played. It was a ton of fun. It was awesome.

359
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Even on the PTR after we made some adjustments, it was still kind of above that mark.

360
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And we were really hesitant to let the exact same build, exact same play style dominate the meta for multiple seasons in a row.

361
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
We know that you want variety and we want to, we don't want to like completely kill the build and take it off the map.

362
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But we just want to make sure that you don't feel obligated to play the exact same way season over season

363
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
because there's so many cool ways of playing classes and we just want to make sure that that is the case.

364
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So with that in mind, we're capping the scaling on that.

365
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
We should hopefully keep earthquake builds at an appropriate spot and not as dominant as they had been.

366
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And of course, we've got some new items coming in the season.

367
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
These ones were tested on PTR and we've made some adjustments to them as well, but they mainly target mighty throw.

368
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We did see that on the PTR, mighty throw was very mighty and was led to some really cool clips of people like one-shotting some of our late game bosses

369
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
where you build up all your multipliers, mighty throw and just kind of chunks their health total all the way down.

370
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
A little too mighty.

371
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yes, a lot of fun. We love that play style. Just the exact number tuning maybe was a bit high.

372
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So we've brought some of that down, but we still think that it's going to be really compelling to play mighty throw next season.

373
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Let's take a look at some of those items I'm referring to here.

374
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You've got the Bane of Ajaden, which is going to every 12 seconds, you mighty throw and it deals a ton instantly.

375
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This was one part of that one-shot build as well as aspect of delayed extinction really changes up how you think about mighty throw.

376
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You're no longer reducing its cooldown with cooldown reduction. You're actually just increasing its damage kind of multiplicatively.

377
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And so it really says, hey, one big moment, you make the throw, it hits super hard and it's a ton of fun.

378
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So we've got these new items and so really look forward to seeing how you play with them with mighty throw.

379
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
All right, I think we got a little clip of this in action, right? It's still quite strong against a lot of these smaller enemies.

380
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
With the triple mighty throw here, you're going to clear out the pack pretty darn quick.

381
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
All right, let's move on to the next class. We've got the Druid.

382
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So Druid, the big change here since the PTR is a big buff to Earth and Might.

383
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
This is the key passive for Earth-based Druids.

384
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And in the past, all it did was it granted you a bunch of resource and gave you guaranteed critical strikes.

385
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
We do know that as you're getting into the late game, you're probably getting close to maxing out your critical strike chance anyway.

386
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And so it never really found a lot of footing in late game builds because of that.

387
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It was kind of redundant with a lot of the problems you're already solving.

388
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So now we've added an additional multiplicative damage for your critical strikes when Earth and Might procs.

389
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And so we think that's going to be really compelling to make it competitive with other key passes.

390
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Additionally, Druid is definitely the class that has struggled the most with early game resource.

391
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So we've made a couple of adjustments there to just make sure that their early game feels a little bit smoother,

392
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
some buffs to some of the resource generation.

393
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And with the Earth and Might buff, also comes a buff to Gathlin's Birthright.

394
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
This is the new unique helm that really encourages you to stay in human form.

395
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
We have some other unique helms that say, hey, be a werewolf all the time or be a werebear all the time.

396
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Human form Druid, the kind of non-shape-shifting one felt a little bit left out.

397
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So we've got this new unique. Let's take a look at it here.

398
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That empowers you while you're in human form.

399
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
If you're doing nature magic and you get some critical strikes, you're going to build up to Anima of the Forest.

400
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And when you do that, it grants you both the Perfect Storm and the Earth and Might key passive for a time.

401
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And of course Earth and Might being buffed up means Gathlin's Birthright is buffed up even more.

402
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
We also increased the duration of the effect.

403
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Previously on the PTR was only 10 seconds, so it had a little bit lower uptime.

404
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And we just think going up to 15 seconds means you're in this empowered state a bit more often.

405
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And it also stacks up against bosses.

406
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
We know that fighting bosses is going to be an important part of the season.

407
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And so this is just much more usable since the PTR in those situations.

408
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Very appropriate.

409
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And of course with Aspect of Impending Deluge, we're talking about nature magic skills in human form.

410
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Storm Strike fits the bill there.

411
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And so this is going to be a nice piece to the puzzle for this style of build moving forward.

412
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I think we got a little video clip of Gathlin's Birthright in action.

413
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
We've got your buff bar with your buffs active.

414
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
As you kind of get into combat and are doing these nature magic critical strikes, you're eventually going to trigger all three key passes at once.

415
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
The one you currently have selected as well as Earth and Might and the Perfect Storm.

416
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
That'll really make a strong moment of power.

417
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You see all those buffs active on your bar down there.

418
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
All right, next up we've got the Necromancer.

419
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So for Necromancer, the big story of Necro on the PTR and I guess from last season was that Bloodwave was pretty good.

420
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It was an okay skill.

421
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It might have been one of those ones that was kind of short circuiting the progression into the endgame.

422
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Maybe a little too good.

423
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So on the PTR we did take several big swings at Bloodwave.

424
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We really wanted to make sure that we did not kind of repeat that situation.

425
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We do think we over swung just a little bit.

426
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So there's a little bit of a numeric buff up to Bloodwave just to make sure.

427
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Because we don't want to completely eviscerate and kill these builds outright.

428
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
We want to just bring them back to a healthy spot.

429
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And so with that we've kind of compensated Bloodwave a little bit since the PTR.

430
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
One of the other big changes we made on the PTR was a rework to Bloodlance.

431
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Bloodlance was one of our best AoE based core skills in the past.

432
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But it was like pretty terrible at single target situations.

433
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And so we did a little bit of a rework where it gained some single target viability at the expense of AoE.

434
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And we definitely think we swung a little too hard and killed its AoE a little too much.

435
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So we caused it to be always spreading which helps it to ramp up a little bit faster in those AoE situations.

436
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So we think that'll kind of bring it to a more healthy balance compared to where it was in terms of the AoE and single target balance.

437
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And finally we also made Vampiric Curse is now actually a curse.

438
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Turns out it's in the name. It just made sense.

439
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It makes sense.

440
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's particularly relevant for the new unique item.

441
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
We can take a look at that, the Sanguevar Blade of Zir.

442
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,000
This is the new unique item in the season that causes your summons, your skeleton warriors and mages and golem,

443
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
to apply Vampiric Curse to enemies.

444
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And by doing that you're going to stack up this Vampiric Curse effect.

445
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And when you cast Army of the Dead it's going to unleash the Vampiric Curse.

446
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
We think it's a really cool playstyle.

447
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Of course the curse now interacts with all of your curse effects like damage to cursed enemies

448
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
or when you apply a curse do a thing.

449
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It all works with that.

450
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And of course this item itself was buffed up a few times since the PTR as well.

451
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,000
It's multiplicative scaler at the bottom has been increased as well as some of the affixes on it have gotten some improvements as well

452
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
to really make sure that this style of play really hits the mark.

453
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Additionally we've got a new legendary aspect, the aspect of service and sacrifice.

454
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I really love the playstyle of this.

455
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It causes your skeleton warriors to explode on death and they lose health while in combat.

456
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So they kind of are expendable army fodder.

457
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
While your mages are a bit more resilient and kind of providing that constant backline,

458
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
you're summoning these warriors to go run in and die.

459
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Provides an interesting little difference in playstyle.

460
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And this one also was just a little bit under the mark on the PTR

461
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
and so we've increased the raw damage output that the skeleton warriors are doing since PTR.

462
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I think we've got a clip of some of these in action, right?

463
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So you've got your warriors here, they're running up.

464
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Even though they're not taking too many hits, they do eventually die in combat

465
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
and do a little explosion to clear out.

466
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
If you stacked up all of your Vampiric Curse, when you cast Army of the Dead,

467
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
you just get this chain of these skeletons spawning out from you that run out

468
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
and also kind of contribute to the damage output of that Army of the Dead.

469
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I think it's really cool and adds a bigger moment when you press that Army of the Dead effect.

470
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
We also got a bit on Bloodlance. I kind of alluded to it earlier here.

471
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
This is the updated tooltip. It'll now always spread its lanced effect,

472
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
that additional debuff that causes its damage to arc to other enemies.

473
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
On the PTR, it would only spread if you had already lanced them.

474
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Now it'll always do it. It's kind of always a two-target cleave effect.

475
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So that should just help with kind of ramping up its damage.

476
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And then if you're hitting somebody who already has the debuff, it deals double damage.

477
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And that really helps its bossing that single-target capabilities.

478
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Poke Balal in the eye.

479
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh, yeah. Poke him in the eye many times.

480
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
One of his many eyes. There's a lot of them.

481
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
We need a lot of Bloodlances.

482
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Absolutely. Let's take a look at the clip here real quick.

483
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So even as you're going into the pack, you're going to get that lance debuff,

484
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
that red glow with the kind of arcing lines between enemies.

485
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It's just going to ramp up that much faster.

486
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And really helps you clear out packs just a little bit quicker than it was before.

487
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
All right. Let's move on to the Rogue.

488
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
On the Rogue, there are a couple adjustments.

489
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
One was a change to the way Shadow Clone and its rank 5 upgrade worked.

490
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Previously, when you got Shadow Clone to rank 5, when you cast it, it became a Cutthroat skill.

491
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Which was a little weird and unintuitive in terms of like what did it interact with?

492
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Did it count as a Cutthroat skill for various effects?

493
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
We decided to kind of clarify that and just make Shadow Clone always baseline Cutthroat skill.

494
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Which means anything that your Shadow Clone mimics from you.

495
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So if you cast, you know, Penetrating Shot and your Shadow Clone mimics it,

496
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:23,000
the Shadow Clone's version counts as a Cutthroat skill for any kind of modifiers or damage bonuses you might have.

497
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So, just kind of a nice little quality of life there.

498
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Death Trap was kind of the big story of Rogue, I think, on the PTR, where Death Trap was really good.

499
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It was a little too good.

500
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It had a number of reworks come into it, and specifically on Scoundrel's Leather unique,

501
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
that caused you to teleport to the position where you're throwing your Death Trap.

502
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Which was really cool and really fun, but ultimately it meant that the build kind of solved too many problems right away.

503
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Just like we had talked about previously with Blood Wave and some other builds, it was a little too easy to do everything.

504
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You had damage, you had cooldown reduction, you had teleport and mobility, you pulled in enemies with Death Trap.

505
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And so, with that in mind, and it was also a little too easy to get to that state where you had zero cooldown on it.

506
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah, especially with the Ur of R bombs.

507
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Absolutely.

508
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah.

509
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So, we talked about the Ur of R bombs and how we're adjusting that away from flat reduction.

510
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
We also just increased the base cooldown on Death Trap by a little bit and reduced some of its sources of cooldown reduction.

511
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,000
We still anticipate once you're really getting into that hyper late game and your build is super optimized, you get the right master working and tempers,

512
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
you're still going to get to that state.

513
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's just going to take a little longer to get there.

514
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's not quite as trivial to be chain spamming that.

515
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And also, we have removed the teleport from Scoundrel's Leather when you cast it.

516
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That was something that kind of just put it over.

517
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It checked too many boxes.

518
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And we know that Rogue is already one of our most mobile classes.

519
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You've got Dash, you've got Shadow Step, you've got plenty of other ways of moving around the battlefield that we felt like this was a little too much for this build in particular.

520
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So, we've done a number of things to tune that back and we think it'll still be a very strong build.

521
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
We just want to make sure that it doesn't really trivialize the game like it was on the PTR.

522
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yeah, I'm still going to play this.

523
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Absolutely.

524
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It's still going to be a great build, I am sure.

525
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I play only Rogue lately.

526
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I mean, I have a Rogue tattoo, so it's like it makes sense.

527
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Show with the screen.

528
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Things I did not expect to hear on a stream.

529
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But yeah, I plan on playing Rogue.

530
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Nice.

531
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Well, there's also some new items that talk to the other trap in Rogue's kit, Poison Trap, the Bands of Icarus Rose.

532
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
We can take a look at that here.

533
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
This is...

534
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
One of the problems with Poison Trap before was that it really struggled to fit into a lot of builds.

535
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It didn't really synergize with a lot of your effects like combo points or your other class mechanics.

536
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
And so now with the new unique, Poison Trap is going to deal all of its damage kind of up front, right over the first three seconds,

537
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
rather than a long nine second duration.

538
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So you really get much higher DPS.

539
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Benefits from what's upgrades, which are even more empowered.

540
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And it benefits from all of your class mechanics, your combo points, inner sight or preparation.

541
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So if you're playing Poison Trap, this is just like really makes it a marquee skill.

542
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And I'm really excited to see the kind of builds that emerge with this new unique.

543
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Similarly, the legendary aspect, Aspect of Contamination, adds a little bit of an extra burst to it,

544
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
which can increase your poison damage and rewards you for building up a more critical strike chance.

545
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I think we've got a clip of this in action as well.

546
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
And this is like probably my favorite clip in here because you just kind of put the enemy to sleep.

547
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
He just falls down and stays down because one of the upgrades on Poison Trap knocks down an enemy.

548
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And with Bands of Icarus Rose, it's going to increase that knockdown timer.

549
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It's going to double that knockdown timer.

550
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And so it can really put enemies to sleep.

551
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And if you've got enough DPS, you're going to shred right through them.

552
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
All right, let's move on to the Sorcerers.

553
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
On the Sorceress, there's a number of bigger changes here.

554
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
The biggest one probably being the rework to Avalanche, which was one of the key passives that talked to Frost skills.

555
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Previously, it was a lucky hit effect that would give you a free cast.

556
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
We did not really find that super compelling or super empowering.

557
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
So we'll take a look at that in just a moment.

558
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The new reworked version.

559
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We also smoothed out Familiar, the Conjuration skill.

560
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
We smoothed out its animation quite a bit.

561
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
There's a lot of feedback, which was around it.

562
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It just didn't feel right to press.

563
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
The game feel there.

564
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You know, you press the button, you're like, it took too long to come out.

565
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Your character is kind of rooted in place for a little too long.

566
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So we've sped that up a little bit.

567
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So it feels much smoother to weave into your play style.

568
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Yeah, it felt really sticky with the amount of charges we gave you too.

569
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You start with three and you're just sort of stuck there.

570
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Yeah, you're like, I want to cast all three.

571
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But then it was like, I felt like I was just being rooted in place to cast the skill.

572
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So we've definitely updated that.

573
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And of course, the new items are talking about Ice Shards quite a bit.

574
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And so we'll take a look at that in a moment.

575
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
First, let's look at the Avalanche rework.

576
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
This has kind of been simplified down a little bit with previous Lucky Hit and some bonus casts.

577
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Now it's just going to always affect all of your Frost skills.

578
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
They're going to cost less mana and deal increased damage.

579
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And then if you apply Vulnerable to the enemies, you're going to get even more bonus.

580
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And so this is really just right along the lines of what Frost skills wants to be doing.

581
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It's really looking to...

582
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
When you had like some of the complexity in the previous version of Avalanche,

583
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
we didn't really feel like it added that much to the gameplay.

584
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And so we looked at where we can just empower the build,

585
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
simplify it a little bit in terms of gameplay,

586
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
because we didn't really feel like the old version was really hitting that mark.

587
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah, it's also true Frost and true Cold, which we haven't really seen too much of.

588
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Right, absolutely.

589
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Next we've got the new items, the Hail of Virglass.

590
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
This is the new unique helm that is really potent for your Ice Shards build.

591
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Ice Shards are going to be spreading out and dealing a spread of damage rather than just a single straight line.

592
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It kind of helps with its AoE potential.

593
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
You do more damage if you're hitting them with multiple Ice Shards.

594
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And of course you get even more.

595
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So really an interesting way to update the play style there.

596
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And Shivering Aspect is going to give you some more multiplicative damage based on how much you're chilling enemies.

597
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Once again, playing into the cold builds.

598
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But also by how much you've staggered a boss.

599
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:51,000
We know that this has been a pain point across all of the classes where some of these bonuses to crowd controlled enemies don't work on bosses.

600
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And of course being Belial's return with the season of bosses,

601
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,000
we really want to make sure that many of these effects do in fact work against boss fights in a way that just makes sense.

602
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Rather than feeling like, oh I'm a crowd control based build, now I'm suddenly, I lose out on so many of these bonuses against bosses.

603
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
We don't really want that to be the case, that's not the kind of play style we want to encourage.

604
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Where you feel punished for taking on bosses.

605
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
And so many effects like Shivering Aspect do work against bosses in addition to crowd controlled kind of normal enemies.

606
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And we've also got a, just a side by side comparison of Familiars.

607
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So on the left we got before, you can see how long it kind of takes you to cast all three, and then to get moving afterwards.

608
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And on the right, the after version, much faster, much snappier animation, and you can get on the move and continue on with combat that much quicker.

609
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It's going to feel a lot better to play.

610
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
All right, and the final class, we've got the Spirit Born.

611
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So the Spirit Born, probably the biggest thing that we've updated since the PTR was a bug fix on the unyielding hits aspect.

612
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
This is one of the most popular legendary aspects that Spirit Born players have been using.

613
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,000
It increases your weapon damage, like your weapon, like raw damage just goes up.

614
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And so you would think, hey, that increases all of my damage output because everything is kind of based on your weapon.

615
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That was true for most cases, but there was a few interactions where it wasn't properly working,

616
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,000
notably with the Eagle Spirit Hall bonus that would throw out the Quill Volley Feathers.

617
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And also with the new Unique, the Sunbird's Gorgit, it was not properly working there.

618
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So now it will be working. Now it's a really powerful multiplier to work into those builds.

619
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And we think that's going to help quite a bit to make sure those builds are competitive.

620
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
We've also heard the feedback that basic skill builds have not really hit the mark.

621
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And so Sepizontic, that's the Unique that really empowers those basic builds.

622
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
We've given some numeric buffs there just to make sure that, you know,

623
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
just give them that little bit of a bump to bring them up to par.

624
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And finally, I wanted to highlight those new items and reworks that we were talking about, the Sunbird's Gorgit.

625
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Let's take a look at this new, unique amulet.

626
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
This one's really cool. It promotes a very alternative playstyle,

627
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
where you're all about spawning Stormfeathers.

628
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And as you pick them up, you spawn this Firestorm around you that grows and intensifies the more Stormfeathers you pick up.

629
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So you really want to be spawning a bunch of them and then moving around and collecting them up.

630
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And it deals more damage. It grows in size.

631
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And the Stormfeathers and the Firestorm benefit from all of your skill tags,

632
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
all of your Jaguar skills, your Eagle skills, and the Stormfeather tag.

633
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Really a very cool alternative playstyle here.

634
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Rather than just casting basic or core skills, you're focusing on Stormfeathers instead.

635
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Additionally, we've got a new aspect to buff up the Rushing Claw skill,

636
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
which really struggled to find its place.

637
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
We've also got a little bit of a rework to Rushing Claw, some of its upgrades, that we'll show in a moment.

638
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
First, let's take a video clip on the Sunbirds here.

639
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
You've got your line of Stormfeathers all in a row.

640
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You go and you pick them up and you get this cool little Firestorm around you.

641
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And the more you pick up, the more you spawn, the stronger and bigger it gets up to a cap.

642
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And it can really help with that AoE damage to clear out packs.

643
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I alluded a little bit to the Rushing Claw rework.

644
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So we've got the two upgrades on the skill tree.

645
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
We've got invasive Rushing Claw.

646
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
This is what was probably the most popular one that was previously being used,

647
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:32,000
where when you run out of charges of it, you will consume four stacks of Ferocity to refresh the charges.

648
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
In this case, you're constantly spamming this button over and over again.

649
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
It's really like your primary skill of your build.

650
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Now there's an alternative playstyle with Poised Rushing Claw, which gives it a much increased maximum charges.

651
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But when you cast it, it does consume all of those charges.

652
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
So those charges are no longer how many times can I cast the skill.

653
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's really kind of a stacking damage multiplier, is how many charges.

654
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So if you have cooldown reduction or ways of reducing your cooldown, you're actually stacking up damage on a Rushing Claw,

655
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
and it's going to hit a much larger area.

656
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So let's take a look.

657
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
We've got a Poised Rushing Claw here.

658
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
This is the one big hit, right?

659
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It hits three times the area, clears right through a pack, but you can't hit it that often.

660
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Alternatively, you've got invasive Rushing Claws, which lets you kind of slice through the pack.

661
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
You constantly have this available to you as it refreshes its cooldown, or you save up for this one big moment.

662
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So really interesting.

663
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Two different ways of playing this skill now.

664
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah, I love when we're able to actually do that, where a skill can actually function in a completely different way.

665
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I think that's some of the best work that we have on our skills.

666
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yeah, absolutely.

667
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I love just giving you alternative ways of playing it, like the same base effect, but just really recontextualizing what you're looking for in itemization or other legendary effects, or just in moment-to-moment gameplay.

668
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I think that's where some of our best gameplay comes out.

669
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah, I think we want to be doing more of that.

670
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Awesome.

671
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Well, thank you, Charles, for walking us through all the class changes that are coming with Season 8, and of course the PTR changes that we kind of went over a few of them really quickly here.

672
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Again, everyone will be able to see the... let's see your piece, guys.

673
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It's fallen off like 10 times when the camera's been on.

674
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
There it goes.

675
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Now I'm going to fish for it for like 10 minutes.

676
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It's just gone.

677
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
You can check out the patch notes immediately after this stream.

678
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
We'll have it on Diablo4.com, and that is pretty extensive.

679
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It goes through every single thing that we've talked about, plus more that we couldn't fit into the stream,

680
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
because we'd probably keep you here for eight hours if we just went over all the patch notes specifically.

681
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So make sure to check that out.

682
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Of course, with a new season comes a lot of changes that are coming within the systems as well.

683
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And so, Colin, do you want to walk us through some of the big changes that we have coming?

684
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Yeah, we cherry-picked some things just to keep it quick.

685
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
So I'd love to jump into the next slide, which definitely wasn't adjusted, but that's okay.

686
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I remember some of the things.

687
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So we removed Conduit Shrine just for the season.

688
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
We heard feedback that maybe it wasn't the greatest of shrines in previous seasons.

689
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
You know, it was actually a tease for Belial.

690
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
He was just screwing you over.

691
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
So we're just taking it off.

692
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Why? It's not really a shrine.

693
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's not really a powerful thing.

694
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
What if you just couldn't cast your skills for 15 seconds?

695
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So we removed it.

696
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
We're going to take it offline.

697
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
We're going to rework it into something more powerful and better.

698
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So look forward to that in the future.

699
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
We also brought back the ancestral whisper caches from season seven.

700
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
This is just sort of an example of things that we're trying to pull in from previous seasons that we think are working really well.

701
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I think it's going to pair nicely with the apparition, incursion, whispers.

702
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So sometimes you're going to get a really badass cache out of it.

703
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Obel Gambler.

704
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
What does that mean?

705
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So we've buffed the shit out of the Obel Gambler.

706
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So generally in Torment Plus, when you buy an entire inventory full of loot from the Gambler, at least generally one of them should be ancestral, sometimes more.

707
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So it's going to be mostly legendaries that actually come out of the Obel.

708
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So I think it's going to be a pretty massive buff.

709
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
The second thing that's not listed here is that we've also made leveling glyphs easier from the PTR.

710
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So now you can actually level glyphs at like a 50-pit tier deficit.

711
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
It's just out of chance.

712
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
So if you're not able to get to pit tier 100, you're still able to grind through and eventually level those glyphs up.

713
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:24,000
We think that this just is a little bit more forgiving and it makes sure that like you don't necessarily have to play an S tier build to actually level up those glyphs all the way.

714
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
You are going to take longer.

715
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And then the second thing or I keep saying the second thing.

716
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
The other thing that we've done is we actually didn't talk about this in the PTR, but we changed tempering.

717
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And I just wanted to say, I think it's amazing.

718
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Tempering will remember the recipe now.

719
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So you're able to just sort of hit it.

720
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Yeah, I think searching through the list and then like, you know, going back over every single time.

721
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Yeah, it was another below ism.

722
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

723
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
He wanted you to go through the flow again.

724
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So yeah, we've made that a lot better.

725
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So I think like that covers a lot of the sort of cherry picked cool things that I thought was worth talking about.

726
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah, that's definitely.

727
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And then I know we have some other big changes that are coming.

728
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Maybe this is the second thing again.

729
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah.

730
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah.

731
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

732
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I totally forgot to put this on there.

733
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So in the PTR, we took some pretty big swings on leveling progression and torment progression.

734
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And I just want to sort of rehash what you're saying, which is the PTR is a place to test.

735
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It's a place to test.

736
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Test.

737
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
We might put things in that we're not necessarily committed to because we want to test it.

738
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So your feedback is super valuable.

739
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's a discussion always right with the community and the players.

740
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
We ourselves play the PTRs to feel things out.

741
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It's a really good place for us to do that because we're able to play with some of you all.

742
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So, you know, might be me on the other side of the screen griefing you or something.

743
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I'm just kidding.

744
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I wouldn't do that.

745
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So I think one of the things we did is tone back the leveling speed reduction.

746
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So it's a little bit slower, but it's not as slow as it was in the PTR.

747
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
We just want to sort of smooth out that leveling experience.

748
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It's not really that big of a difference in terms of season eight.

749
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
The other thing we did also change is the torment and pit scaling.

750
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
So we've nerfed that from what it was on PTR, but it's still a little bit stronger than it was on season seven.

751
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Again, really, this is sort of us trying to find the sweet spot of introducing a bunch of new seasonal power.

752
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
We also want to make sure a torment progression feels as good as it did in season six,

753
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
where you sort of have this like journey and sort of challenge that you need to face to overcome.

754
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
We think unlocking that power and progressing through our game just is that much sweeter

755
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
when you hit that sweet spot of actually having to work for some of this stuff.

756
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So we've paired it back.

757
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You can think about it as torment one is about a pit tier harder than season seven

758
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,000
and torment four is about six to seven pit tiers harder than it was on season seven coming in season eight.

759
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
So we have paired back. Feedback was super helpful.

760
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I know everyone was losing their minds that we made the game doubly hard.

761
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
That's just sort of how we balance things on the PTR is we either double or half it.

762
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It just helps us sort of lock in a good middle ground.

763
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
We also find if we buff it like 10%, it's like, did we even change anything?

764
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Yeah, and we don't want to sort of take an approach where we like stealthily make the game harder over three seasons.

765
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So we just want to sort of figure out a good middle ground.

766
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So that was the second thing.

767
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
That was the second thing.

768
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And so the other second thing is we have some big changes that are coming to the season journey as well.

769
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And I know you wanted to talk about some of that.

770
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yeah. So with the changes that we'll talk about after this with the introduction of Reliquary,

771
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
we've actually taken an opportunity to separate out the season's journey from the battle pass.

772
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So that also means all of the ashes that you would earn have been taken out of the battle pass.

773
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:32,000
You no longer sort of have this complicated system where you're doing the season's journey to earn favor to then progress the battle pass to then try and get your ashes.

774
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
But those are level locked.

775
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
It was just too many, too many things.

776
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
So we've taken it out.

777
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Now it's very clear.

778
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And I think the season's journey is going to feel a lot more rewarding in that now all the ashes are earned through the season's journey.

779
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
And we also have individual rewards for each objective within a chapter.

780
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And we've also just refreshed the UI.

781
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So we're able to compact and sort of consolidate some of the objectives into a really clear sort of singular objective.

782
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
You'll notice like you put on your glasses.

783
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I have to like lean in to actually read some of these things.

784
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,000
But you'll notice that some of these objectives have sub objectives and it just sort of better encapsulates what we are asking you to do.

785
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So I think this is going to be a pretty big win for the overall system.

786
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
It lets us evolve it a little bit more now that it's detached from the battle pass.

787
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And I think it's just overall a much cleaner and rewarding experience.

788
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Yeah, most definitely.

789
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I know that the season's blessings being moved into season journey and like being less complicated when it was in the battle pass was a big thing we've heard from some players.

790
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Because I know there's points where we actually had moments where sometimes maybe a player would end up getting a season blessing or so just buying like an accelerator or whatever.

791
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
So this now completely detaches it from it, which is a really big thing that we wanted to hit on, especially with feedback from from players.

792
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
So thank you, Colin, for walking us through.

793
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
There's more changes in the patch notes that that Colin hit on here.

794
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So again, check them out afterwards.

795
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
But one thing we did want to talk about, and this is kind of alluding to what Colin was talking about before him with this.

796
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
The season journey is the reliquary itself.

797
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Reliquary, if you guys actually read the blog earlier this week for season eight, the reliquary is a brand new system that is being added into Diablo 4.

798
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It actually starts with season eight specifically and will be in seasons going forward.

799
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But this is kind of a change to the whole entire battle pass system.

800
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It gives players a lot more control, a little bit more choice on exactly rewards that they want.

801
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Plus it gives more variety in the actual rewards that they're going to be getting.

802
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I was not.

803
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
We actually have a video for for the reliquary.

804
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Funny enough, I was not planning on hosting today.

805
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Marcus, Marcus is actually out sick today.

806
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So get well, Marcus.

807
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Have a smoothie.

808
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Uh, and uh, so I am hosting and Marcus was supposed to throw to this video, which is done by myself.

809
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So I will be throwing it to myself to talk a little bit more about reliquary.

810
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So you guys get a little bit of a better understanding of what the new system is.

811
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Take a look.

812
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Hi everyone.

813
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I'm thrilled to share the exciting changes coming to season eight Belial's return with the reliquary system.

814
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:14,000
This refresh to the battle pass system puts choice at the forefront, allowing you to select the order in which you unlock rewards from different catalogs.

815
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You alone will determine how to spend the favor you earn from slaying demons and completing quests in both seasonal and eternal realms, picking rewards that speak most to your character's fantasy.

816
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Now we're going to look at the features of the system, how to unlock rewards from it, and what you can expect to find in each reliquary.

817
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:41,000
In the battle pass reliquaries, you will find individual catalogs you can earn rewards from, each one being a reliquary.

818
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,000
With the launch of the upcoming season, Belial's return, you will have these battle pass reliquary options.

819
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Belial's return, weapons, beasts, and armor.

820
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Each reliquary contains cosmetic rewards to customize your wanderer.

821
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
To earn these rewards, players will need to acquire favor, which is gained by killing monsters and completing quests.

822
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Each time you fill a bar, you acquire one favor token.

823
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You can hold up to 99 favor tokens at a time and must spend some before you're able to earn more.

824
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Also note that up to 99 favor tokens do carry over from season to season if you don't spend it, giving you a head start on next season's reliquaries.

825
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Let's dive a little deeper by checking out Belial's return, a battle pass reliquary available for everyone on season launch.

826
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Here you will choose the order and which rewards are unlocked.

827
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Items in a reliquary can be claimed in whatever order you desire, and you can claim items for any reliquary while it's available.

828
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So if you want this badass Celestian mount before the star-crossed Path Town portal, the power of choice is in your hand.

829
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
You may have noticed one item in the above reliquary has a star icon on it.

830
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
This is a bonus reward.

831
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
These rewards are automatically unlocked once you have claimed all other items in the specific reliquary using favor.

832
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Bonus rewards are just that, a bonus.

833
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
And don't require favor to claim.

834
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Remember to claim them as soon as they are unlocked.

835
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Wanderers who complete all battle pass reliquaries will receive the pieces needed to arm themselves in the menacing guise of the Deceiver armor set.

836
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
There will be two battle pass bundle options for players.

837
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
The premium battle pass bundle unlocks all three premium reliquaries at a discount,

838
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:28,000
while the deluxe battle pass bundle gives instant access to the bonus armor set and two additional rewards you won't find in other reliquaries.

839
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Lastly, reliquaries introduced the ability for us to now create unique tie-ins for future events and IP collaborations.

840
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
These are completely separate from the battle pass and we're looking forward to creating special moments for all players out there.

841
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Let's go through our first example with our Diablo and Berserk collaboration coming soon.

842
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Our first collab reliquary will have a unique currency that players can acquire in-game called Behelots.

843
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
This will roll out in early May and we're looking forward to you gathering and earning Berserk themed cosmetics.

844
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Events will generally be available for shorter periods of time, so you should check on this tab every now and then.

845
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Reliquaries launch with Season 8 Belial's return.

846
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
For more details, check out our Reliquary System section in the official Season 8 blog.

847
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Thanks for watching and we'll see you all in Sanctuary.

848
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Thanks Adam for the update on reliquaries.

849
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:29,000
It's very odd seeing myself on camera and having cut myself to, or cut to myself for reliquaries.

850
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:36,000
But if you want to learn more about reliquaries itself, we do have a pretty deep dive on it in our Season 8 blog, which was posted on Monday.

851
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
So just go to Diablo4.com, you can check out reliquaries.

852
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
We're going to hear how reliquaries feels with people when they jump into the game on Season 8.

853
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So let us know, like jump in, try it out, see how it works out, and provide feedback.

854
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Because we're always open to hearing about more related to anything related to, or anything related to Diablo 4.

855
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
That's what I, that's what I have to say.

856
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So, next up, one thing that we did want to talk about, and this kind of actually ties back into what I was talking about on the video,

857
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
which is our first IP collab.

858
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
This is something that we teased last week and we announced earlier this week that we're super stoked about,

859
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and this is the Berserk Diablo collab.

860
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It's kind of like the collab that is like a match made in hell, haha.

861
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Just because if you're a fan of Berserk, you probably know how well that melds in with the Diablo universe.

862
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So it's really, really cool.

863
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
This is actually launching on May 6.

864
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And again, it has an event reliquary with some cosmetics that are associated with it, as you guys saw in the video.

865
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
And some of them are really, really cool.

866
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
There's a ton of cool stuff for people to actually collect and, of course, grab.

867
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And, you know, some of the items in the event reliquary that I mentioned on the video are here, like, including, you know, gear, banners for your actual character,

868
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
markings on your character as well.

869
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And then there's other cosmetics available that will be available in the shop that are really, really cool as well,

870
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,000
that are throwbacks essentially to Berserk, which I believe we have here.

871
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
We got one, I know, for the Necromancer, the Barb, and the Rogue.

872
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
These look absolutely sick. That Necromancer one is ridiculous.

873
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Yeah.

874
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
So, metal.

875
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Really, really cool.

876
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And then one other thing is this is disturbing, but also awesome.

877
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Awesome. And I'm going to butcher the name. This is Chimimoro? Chimimoro? Chimimoro?

878
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah, yeah, Chimimoro from Berserk.

879
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Funny enough, a really popular character that doesn't appear much in the Berserk manga,

880
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:49,000
but we also nicknamed him the Schnoz, is a pet that will also be available in Diablo 4 with the Berserk Diablo collab.

881
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
It's adorable, it's disturbing. Don't you just want to pick it?

882
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And, yeah, you want to pick the schnoz nose thing.

883
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
It does actually have an animation where the booger is running out of the nose, which is even more adorable.

884
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
His name is Chimimoro. Chimimoro. Or, Wuru.

885
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
No, we're butchering it. Butchering it. Now we're butchering it.

886
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,000
But, yes. But, yeah. So, this is part of the Berserk lab. This is going to be running from May 6th through June 3rd.

887
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
So, make sure to actually check it out.

888
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So, it'll be a little bit after the start of Season 8, because Season 8 will be starting on April 29th.

889
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
One other thing that we did want to also call out is that Twitch drops are coming back for Season 8.

890
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
We actually have a new weapon that will be available, and that will be from April 29th through May 13th.

891
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You essentially just have to watch three hours on any person that is streaming Diablo 4 during those time periods

892
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
and make sure that you have Twitch drops enabled and your accounts all connected and everything like that.

893
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
And you'll end up getting a new weapon cosmetic, which is really cool, and we'll show it here in a second.

894
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Separately, we do have a support a streamer program that is going on that is also tied with Berserk.

895
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,000
But this is the weapon here. It's the Mero of the Brutes. It's a two-handed sword. Looks really sick.

896
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Super stoked for this one. And then we have a support a streamer. This one is a gift or purchase just one sub to any content creator that is streaming Diablo 4 between May 6th and June 3rd.

897
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:28,000
This is between the Berserk timelines, and you'll get this cool mount trophy, which is the Skull Behelet mount trophy that will be available May 6th through June 3rd.

898
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,000
So Twitch drops is coming back for the start of Season 8, and then we'll have a support a streamer that will start with the Berserk collab.

899
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,000
So a lot of cool stuff that is coming up, and that's all the content that we have here.

900
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I know as we always do for every single stream, we do go into a Q&A.

901
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So I know we do want to talk about a few items within the Q&A. So if you're on Twitch...

902
01:09:50,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It's one of those days, everyone. Throwing to myself. Squeaky voices. Earpiece doesn't stay in. Stuff like that. Chimimuru.

903
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But if you do have questions in chat, make sure to ask them on Twitch. We have chat enabled there. We'll be taking them.

904
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:15,000
There's a few things I know as we wait on questions kind of kicking in.

905
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:22,000
There goes the earpiece. There needs to be a compilation of the earpiece falling out of my ear this whole entire broadcast.

906
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But a few things that we did want to talk about. One was we had a roadmap that came out earlier this month that players actually saw.

907
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And something that, you know, Colin and I, you and I have been talking about is a lot of players were, you know, they saw it and they're going like,

908
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Hey, is this it? Is this all you guys have on the roadmap? And it's something that we just kind of wanted to reiterate that, you know,

909
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
we do plan on actually making updates to the roadmap as we progress through the timeline.

910
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:57,000
And then, you know, as we get further down the timeline, there are things that, you know, will become more clear,

911
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:03,000
that we'll be updating within these updates that I think players are really expected, like, hopeful to see.

912
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:12,000
We've heard from some of the feedback. And some of those things I know we had chatted about were really around, like, some things around skill trees.

913
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Like, are we going to planning on doing updates to skill trees? Are there any updates to, like, additional endgame features?

914
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And I know you and I had chatted a little bit about it.

915
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Yeah, yeah, we try it like every day, right? They call me up at 9 o'clock.

916
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's like, just just eating dinner, just wanting to chat with Colin.

917
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm like, let me wrap up this nightmare dungeon out. Yeah, let's talk about it.

918
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So I think, like, something that we can talk about is the skill tree is something that we are definitely looking at in terms of doing some sort of major updates, too.

919
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:46,000
We also are taking a look at aspects because aspects skill tree sort of very similar in the same space.

920
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
It is a lot of moving parts, so we want to get it right.

921
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So it is a pretty major thing that we need to take our time on and need to work through so it hits the players at a really high quality bar.

922
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So there are lots of things like that that we are talking about and we're having conversations about.

923
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So really, the roadmap to us is more just a starting point to help sort of flesh out and sort of continue the discussion with you all on, like, how we're building Diablo 4.

924
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Exactly. And, you know, as we progress through the timeline itself and we update the roadmap, some of these things that, you know, we just talked about here will be populated in there.

925
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And you guys will see exactly when those will end up landing.

926
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So really looking forward to updating that and keeping that updated for everyone out there so you guys have better clarity on exactly what's to come for Diablo 4.

927
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
And there's a ton more to come, which we're super stoked about.

928
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Separately, I know that, you know, the the seasons themselves have been a big topic amongst players if like because, you know, for us, I think seasons has always been kind of a opportunity for us to really change Diablo 4 and learn more and more about what players really enjoy.

929
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
You know, we saw that with, you know, past seasons where we've brought back things like malignant rings.

930
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:04,000
We brought back things like vampiric powers. We can sell that in this stream where we're bringing back some of those with the the whisper ancestral caches and everything like that.

931
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And so I know we talked about opportunities, I think, for the community to really, you know, provide some feedback over to us of like what are some of those things that you guys really enjoy?

932
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Because we most definitely want to hear you guys out and see what we can do to maybe reintroducing some of those things to kind of keep things like fresh for for players.

933
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Yeah, it's really like we look to the sort of you all to help inform what are the things that are working really well.

934
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
We also play the game a lot and we sort of like testing out things and seasons to bring back.

935
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I think a really great example of this is if you remember all the way back in season two, which is kind of crazy. It's like over a year now.

936
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Way back. We learned a lot with the sort of blood harvest, right?

937
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
And we took a lot of those learnings and put it into Helltide in season four.

938
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So there's a lot of different ways that it sort of manifests itself in terms of us evolving Diablo four over time, bringing things back.

939
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
We just want to make sure we bring it back in a way that services the overall game and just helps level up the entire game.

940
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:11,000
We just want to make sure that we don't necessarily bring things back that disrupt the fun of the game or sort of ruin the experience.

941
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So it's a fine balance on like what can we bring in. We want to make sure that we're doing it right.

942
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Seasons is a way for us to really test out some crazy stuff or we're not we're okay with things breaking like I think boss powers is a great example of like,

943
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Yeah, it's going to definitely disrupt the balance of the game.

944
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
What are some of the things that we might actually want to pull in or learn from this?

945
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So we're always talking about it. We would love to hear from you on sort of what you think is working really well.

946
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Yeah, because once we hear back from you guys, it gives us, you know, the opportunity to really just like take that, learn and really start building upon that.

947
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Like maybe a for instance, a great example, I think is like Avatar is here. Avatar is here was a great learning point from us where it essentially evolved into what we now have as the pit, which is really cool to see.

948
01:14:52,000 --> 01:15:06,000
So let us know. We most definitely want to keep learning and growing from some of these seasons as they progress and and give us the feedback of what you guys want to kind of see coming back into Diablo 4 to keep things, you know, dynamic and fresh for everyone out there.

949
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:12,000
So we're gonna now jump into after after I ignored this, please update your computer.

950
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:20,000
You are going to jump into questions. So if you have questions again, just feel free to drop into Twitch chat. We'll try to get through as many as possible.

951
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:32,000
We have a question from trial trial Maza that says our boss key still tradable. Yes. Yes. So players can still trade those even with all the changes to the to layer bosses and everything like that.

952
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:40,000
You most definitely can the I actually think what's I talk about a little bit because I think I think it's actually interesting.

953
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Now that the keys are going to be drained from the economy much faster that everyone has to pay their share.

954
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I think the key economy training wise is actually going to be a little bit more interesting and that they're worth a little bit more.

955
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I also think it just works well if you're playing in a party and someone's missing out on a couple of keys, you can trade it to them.

956
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:01,000
So it's still sort of maintains that sort of sort of social element where you and I are playing and you're missing out on some keys.

957
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I can give it to you. You might trade me some. So it all still works, especially since the more players in your party still amplifies the reward of the boss that it gives you.

958
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Yeah, absolutely. Yep. Why so blue panda bear? I don't know why you're so blue panda bear.

959
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Are you still planning on doing immediate fixes for classes that are to OP instead of waiting until mid season patch?

960
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Yeah, that's definitely our shifted philosophy that we talked about on the PTR live stream a while back where we're really looking at that first week or two right after launch.

961
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So really next week and the week after we're going to be taking a big focus on looking for those really big outlier builds those ones that are really maybe short cutting the progression of the game or kind of blowing out the powers that we expect.

962
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And looking to make rapid reaction. It's always in the interest of respecting players time. We don't want it to last too long and then we nerf it later and you feel bad that hey I invested so much time in this.

963
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:02,000
We really want to be rapid in our response to that. With that being said, we are going to be kind of measured in that response.

964
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:11,000
We don't want if something is just strong, if it's like hey this is a strong build, I'm able to do the game, we're not going to just come in and nerf anything that is strong.

965
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:20,000
We're really focusing on the big outliers, both on the high end and on the low end. If something is dramatically underperforming, we'll look to make rapid reaction there as well.

966
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:30,000
But it's all about making sure that you feel comfortable investing in your build, which is why we want to get that out sooner this season and all seasons moving forward.

967
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Yeah, again, it's about taking something that's like S plus to S, right?

968
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Great. So we're not looking to crater or just kneecap any of these crazy builds.

969
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Of course. Setzer111 and Sirius Kingsley actually are asking a question that we kind of just addressed in what we were talking about in the beginning.

970
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Where they're saying like hey, can we get seasonal mechanics more maybe become permanent as like in-game systems?

971
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Or Sir Kingsley asked, can we get seasonal powers out to the game permanently?

972
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:04,000
This kind of just goes back to what we were saying beforehand of let us know what you guys like, like what you guys, what resonated really well with you guys during seasons.

973
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:13,000
And we can look at what we can end up bringing back and incorporating into the game so that you have before is constantly evolving for players specifically from that end.

974
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Condis asked was campaign XP slash leveling nerf since PTR.

975
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:31,000
So we did adjust so I'll take the full journey. So in season eight PTR, we did slow things down substantially. We didn't touch campaign or anything like that.

976
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And then in season eight, we have paired back the nerfs that we did to leveling. So it's it's a lot more similar to season seven.

977
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It's just a little bit more streamlined. We haven't touched campaign XP or anything like that.

978
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Question from Quig6246. Can you guys are for the Q&A later? Can you ask is the new storm strike aspect?

979
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Will it also apply to the free cast from the Crone Stafford Druid?

980
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I'm pretty sure it should.

981
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Well, yes, we'll double confirm.

982
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And a great opportunity for you to follow up with Charles on our sanctuary discord after this stream because he's actually going to be doing an additional Q&A on our sanctuary discord.

983
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
So after the stream might be a good follow up.

984
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I can also just speak a bit more to the we really want our tool tips that have a lot of clarity around the skills.

985
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:39,000
And so I'm stalling for time. If we could get production to bring up that slide one more time, I can tell you with certainty because when we're looking at skill tool tips and we use the word cast, like when you cast Storm Strike with capital C, that is that refers to when you actually press the button and do it.

986
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:48,000
If we don't use the word cast and we just say Storm Strike does a thing, that should work in cases where it gets kind of what we call auto casted by something else.

987
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
By like the great staff of the Crone, it auto cast Storm Strike.

988
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,000
And so depending on the precise wording there, it should be it should clarify that interaction.

989
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:06,000
That's kind of what we we want to stick to to make sure things are clear to players is using that cast wording to differentiate those two cases.

990
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Now, do we have it on screen? And it does look like it does not use the cast terminology here.

991
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
It just says a Storm Strike will just change twice as many targets.

992
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And so that should be working whenever it's auto cast from that the great staff of the Crone effect.

993
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Thank you so much production. That is actually a really good clarification.

994
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I think been knowledgeable for a lot of people about the differences between the term cast and cast.

995
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Yeah, I believe we've been trying to communicate that we've got like a loading screen tooltip in the game.

996
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's easy to miss and totally understandable.

997
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But that's definitely something that on the class design side, we really want to make sure we're being clear about these interactions because we know there's so many interactions in the game.

998
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
So any opportunity to clarify these things, we're definitely going to make sure we do our best in that regard.

999
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
We got a question from chickenwing929. Good name.

1000
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,000
You said in the last live stream that you wanted Torment 4 to be aspirational so that only 10% of players will reach it.

1001
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Will there be a seasonal objective objectives that must be completed in Torment 4 difficulty?

1002
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So players will probably see in this season, like as they get to the last chapter, there are going to be some Torment 4 specific requirements on some of those things.

1003
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And you know, there's like a fine balance, I think, that we're trying to trying to strike where it's like, do we we want there to be like aspirational goals and rewards for players within the season journey itself?

1004
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And then there's also like, okay, we understand that some of those things may require a decent amount of time or a specific build.

1005
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So we really do want to hear like some feedback after players jump into the season, what what they feel works really well, what they don't feel works really well, especially for season journey and some of those later achievements that you have to obtain.

1006
01:21:50,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So let us know like we're open to hearing about it. And we most definitely want to figure out exactly where there's still like aspirational goals, but maybe rewards that maybe can be adjusted around or something like that from from the season journey itself.

1007
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Yeah, definitely open to change.

1008
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Question from Dalius. Are there any plans on adding bounties or other small in-game activities to fill in between other objectives possibly?

1009
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I think that's definitely an interesting space that we've talked about. And it's one of those things that we want to do it right.

1010
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Currently, right now, we're using the whisper system to sort of do that you see that with the apparition incursions where periodically, you know, the apparition incursion will get that whisper that you're able to go do.

1011
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I think the one thing that really kind of we don't love about the whispers right now is that it is based on a timer, we set the timer to be pretty generous, they're constantly rolling.

1012
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:49,000
But we know that this is something that we can improve on. So it's something we definitely are interested in taking a look at.

1013
01:22:49,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Awesome. Question from cross halvain. Cross halvain. Have you thought about buffing glyph building from from content other than pits like dungeons, whispers, bosses?

1014
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So we've made a change to make it so the pit can level those at a much higher deficit. So minus 50. We do like that this is a reward for pushing in the pit.

1015
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:23,000
We kind of like when the rewards are pretty clear what you need to do for it. We also like that of all the different activities in the game, the pits uniqueness is that it is one of the few activities that allows you to sort of modulate your personal difficulty.

1016
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And we want to continue that sort of paradigm where the deeper you push in the pit, the more glyph levels you get. So I think that's definitely working well for us, but open to hearing thoughts and feedback as we continue to develop the game.

1017
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Um, EV demonic 666 evil evil evil evil evies. Uh, I guess it's like an umbryon, isn't it? Uh, what are the drop rates for mythic uniques? Are there are they being increased per boss layer slash torment tier?

1018
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Oh, yeah. So the mythic uniques increase with torment. Um, we actually did a pretty substantial like if you want to farm mythic uniques, uh, I almost called them gigable. I'll supreme.

1019
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Supreme Belial, uh, we get in trouble because we constantly say great greater giga, Uber. Yeah. We have been running out of adjectives for big bad. Um, uh, Supreme Belial has the highest chance of all the Lair bosses and he's really the place to go. Um, so we position mythic, uniques and ancestral targeting and things like that on Supreme Belial.

1020
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Yeah, definitely celebrating the end of the journey when you get to the top of the Lair boss ladder, make that a big moment.

1021
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Uh, cool. We, we had a question in here and it deleted from my documents. I think, um, uh, someone from, from the last question and I have to fill in with something.

1022
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
someone from from the community man of

1023
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Killed it but there was a question related to

1024
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And they may have missed it in the beginning, but I'm just gonna reiterate it

1025
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
But about skill trees that they're gonna be like changes and reworks and things like that

1026
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I know we confirmed earlier that we are looking at it

1027
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
We're looking at doing some stuff and as we get closer to when that is ready

1028
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
We'll we'll end up updating our roadmap to incorporate some of those things

1029
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Last question I'm gonna take is from grim grim grim grim grim. Do you feel like class and build balance?

1030
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,000
We'll be in a good place now. I'm afraid some builds will be a hundred times stronger than other builds again

1031
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Our goal is not to have things that are a hundred times stronger of course

1032
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Balances is constantly ongoing every season. We're making new content new ways of playing the game and also balancing the system

1033
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It's not just on the class side

1034
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:25,000
It's also on like the the like encounters the bosses you're fighting the enemies or the activities you're doing the torment tears in the scaling

1035
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
There's a lot of moving parts here and it's kind of a constant ongoing thing to strive for balance

1036
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And I don't think that even if literally every built built exactly the same amount of dps

1037
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
That wouldn't be ideal either right there should still be some natural variation

1038
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
But our goal is really to allow

1039
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Make sure that players no matter what build you're playing is that you're able to complete a lot of the content in the game

1040
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
If you make any kind of competent build that comes together in a good way

1041
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
You should be able to complete that season journey if you're you're putting in that time

1042
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Get to torment for and be able to take down the the bosses the the strongest form of belial

1043
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
That's our our main goal

1044
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And we understand that sometimes there are going to be some outliers above that

1045
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And we are actively looking to monitor and tamp down on those ones that are a hundred x stronger than everything else

1046
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And also find the ones that are a hundred x weaker than the par or

1047
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You know some number

1048
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Some number weaker and and make sure that they are able to

1049
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:27,000
To achieve all of the goals in the game um our our real driving philosophy is that we don't want you to feel like

1050
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I'm playing the game wrong because i'm not playing this this overpowered build

1051
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Um but exact perfect parity where every build deals exactly the same amount of damage is

1052
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Both impossible and undesirable

1053
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah, I think it's a lot like just sort of taking a step back as well

1054
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Achieving perfect balance really relies on stability and not injecting anything new correct right and I think we try and walk that balance of like

1055
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:55,000
We do want to shake up the meta we want there to be cool new ways to play the game boss powers are getting added to really

1056
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Shake up that meta and that is in direct conflict with perfect balance, right?

1057
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So we are trying to walk that line

1058
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,000
That's not to say that we're cool at the times 100x but it just uh, you know to really reiterate reiterate

1059
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:13,000
They're sort of like at polar opposites of the spectrum adding new stuff and balance are very at odds. So

1060
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Um, cool, I I lied I have one more question which is I want to address it really quickly

1061
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
But cap and mergan asked if we have unused battle pass upgrades or ultimate from like ultimate edition or whatever

1062
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Will those carry over with the new reliquaries?

1063
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Uh, we actually have all the details of how those will work. They're actually being converted over to

1064
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Uh, like reliquary tokens or to platinum depending on what what type of upgrade you actually have so

1065
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
That's all laid out in the blog that we posted earlier this week. So make sure to check out that blog

1066
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
