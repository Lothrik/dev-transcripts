1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Vessel of Hatred is the next big chapter in the story of Diablo 4.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When we last left off, we had defeated Lilith,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and Narell was sailing south with Mephisto's Soul Stone in hand.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is a tremendous burden for someone as young and untrained as Narell.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But somehow, she has found the will to fight,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
challenging the Primeval every step of the way.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In this expansion, we follow their path as Narell seeks salvation from Mephisto

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and searches for a way to banish him back to the Abyss.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As we wrap up Diablo 4, there has been a huge battle in hell

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
between Anarius, the Cathedral of Lights, and Lilith and all of her demons.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Throughout this entire campaign in Diablo 4,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you're basically trying to defeat Lilith.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So you team up with people like Narell, who's this young, eager character.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And then you've got Laura, who is this sort of wise drunk.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He was the Herodram, so he brings this rounded, old-school thinking.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He ends up being the catalyst of the group.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Inarius believed that if he killed Lilith, he would be accepted again by Heaven.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So he went after Lilith.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He actually stabbed her, and Heaven did not take him back.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And he had this moment of, I've been wrong this entire time.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And she used that against him and ended up killing Inarius.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Her goal was to devour her father, Mephisto.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And we ended up actually stopping her.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And so even though she was defeated, she kind of gave us a warning of,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I was the only one that could actually save you from Mephisto.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Narell is left with the Soul Stone.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And she decides to take the essence of Mephisto and trap him into the Soul Stone.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Lorath is still with us and is going to try and help us find information on where Narell went.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And so we leave off with her sailing south with the stone, telling you,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
do not follow.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The world might need you.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And over time, things start to unfold.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And you realize that Narell cannot do this alone.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And so you start your search for her.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When we pick up in Vessel of Hatred, the Cathedral of Light is kind of in disarray.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It became a bit fractured with the death of Narell.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So there was a bit of a split with the Cathedral of Light afterwards.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This created an opening for a whole new sect to rise up and take things into their own hands.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And so you end up with a militant wing of the church that is the Burnt Knights.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Burnt Knights are led by Yervar, a survivor of hell.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He's uncompromising.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He feels that he's final judgment and that he's going to make better decisions for the church.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They battled in hell, and now they're on this manhunt for Narell and for Lorath.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They want them to pay for their crimes, and they think that they should be the ones that have a say in what happens to Sanctuary.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mephisto is the Lord of Hatred.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He's probably the one primeval that can create the most deep-rooted chaos, breaking up the people of Sanctuary.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In the events of Diablo II, he was destroyed. He's been slowly resurrecting himself in hell, and he wants to come back and bring himself back to Sanctuary.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And now that he is in this soul stone that Narell carries, this is his opportunity.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The Herald of Hatred is Mephisto's wolf form. It's this astral projected form that he gets to put out and connect with the player and whisper in people's ears.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The connection between Narell, the player, and Mephisto is the fate of the world.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Narell wants to get rid of him, but the more time she spends with the stone, the tighter the bond between her and the stone is.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The corrupting influence of Mephisto's soul stone is going to potentially convince her to bring Mephisto back instead of destroy him like she originally wanted.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So we need to actually make sure that she fulfills her original intent and doesn't fall to Mephisto's influence.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Narell plans to bring the soul stone into the Vault of Light so she can purify the soul stone of Mephisto's essence.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The Vault of Light is this really sacred place that Akarat created.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
His presence is really important through the history of Sanctuary.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Akarat wandered the world speaking the teachings of the Zacarum faith.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
His tomb is also said to be in the Vault of Light, which is in Nihantu.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Akarat is the one who discovered the spirit realm.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
When the world stone was forged and Sanctuary came out of it, this veil was created, and that's what created the spirit realm.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Demons aren't there. Angels aren't there. It's a very special place for humanity.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And for a long time, the spirit realm was not touched.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And now, Mephisto's corruption is creeping its way.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I mean, that's a fear that everybody in Nihantu is thinking about.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Spirituality is really unique to humanity.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And in the jungle, it's a big part of their culture.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Eru is this elder, this magical being, a spirit born.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And he's really connected to Nihantu.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This is his home. This is his ancestral lineage.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And he's guiding the player on this journey to help Nihantu.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We actually find out that there have been sightings of Nihantu in Nihantu.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And we end up following her there.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
In Vessel of Hatred, this is a story about isolation.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We start off with the concept that Nihantu is trying to do this alone.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But at some point, you realize that things are escalating.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And so we morph from this idea of isolation into the idea of being stronger together.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
For someone that has been through the journey that our wanderer has, that Nihantu has been through,

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you feel there's hope that Sanctuary is not going to be lost.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You get to see pockets of Sanctuary that we haven't been able to see before.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But it's still all in the same tone, in that same world that everybody loves so much.

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Diablo 4 community.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Welcome to another Diablo 4 Developer Update.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is a very special Diablo 4 Developer Update.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is our pre-launch stream before Vessel of Hatred,

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
which is actually going to be shipping here next week, which is crazy to think about.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm joined here by Mr. Brent Gibson, Game Director for Diablo 4.

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I know before we have our big show, you wanted to talk a little bit about Vessel of Hatred and what's to come.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, this is a really big week.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The fact that we're finally on the doorstep of shipping Vessel of Hatred is a bit surreal.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We've been working on it for a very long time.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You know, over the course of the last five seasons, so much has changed.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And we're excited to talk about some of those details today.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Everything kicks off with our epic journey through Nahantu, where we're going to be telling the next chapter of Mephisto.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And it doesn't really stop there.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We haven't talked about it much yet, but we've actually created a custom quest at the end of the story

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
that leads those players who haven't gotten to endgame, we'll get to endgame.

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's awesome.

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Along the way, you're also going to find brand new ways to play with the Kuros Dunder City.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We've talked about this Time Attack dungeon that's super cool.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We'll go into more detail on that today.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We have our co-op PvE experience with the Dark Citadel.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
For those hardcore players that like playing with friends, you're going to have something really cool there.

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And we also have brand new ways of gaining power.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Whether you're hiring mercenaries and leveling them up,

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
or finding our new powerful runes that create runewords to sock it into your gear,

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
you're going to have a lot more ways to actually alter the builds that you've been playing with all this time.

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So at the end of all this, we have the star of our show, our class that wants to go fast,

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the Spirit Born, which everybody got a sneak peek at that quite a while ago.

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And we have been polishing it and getting it ready to make sure that it's the most fun it can be at launch.

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, and it's great because we're actually going to be going through all these aspects today in the live stream

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
with our subject matter experts across each of them.

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So I know, as we mentioned, next week the Vessel of Hatred will actually be shipping and be released to everyone.

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right now the plan is for it to be out on October 8th, and that is still very much the plan.

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Still the plan.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We actually did release a map earlier this week in our What You Need to Know blog.

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That kind of pretty much contains exactly when each of the release dates are going to be.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But players can actually end up doing early download right now on PC Battle.net.

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We do have early download coming up for console this weekend on the 5th.

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So there's a lot of stuff coming down the pipe, a lot of excitement going on.

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The other thing that we did talk about as well is Twitch Drops.

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We do have a Twitch Drops campaign that is actually starting at the launch of Vessel of Hatred.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's actually going to be starting on October 8th in Pacific time.

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So it's about like 12, 16 hours, somewhere around there afterwards.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But there's some really cool back pieces, really cool weapons that you can earn.

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And it goes throughout the whole entire month of October through like that first early part of November.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We also have a support of streamer program this time around, which is really cool

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
support of streamer actually really helps out some of the smaller streamers that are actually really wanting to, you know,

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
stream Diablo 4, which is really great.

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you give two subs for or if you actually purchase two subs across any streamer that is streaming across Diablo 4

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and has this enabled, you'll end up receiving the mount that we actually just showed right there.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And if you do an additional two, you actually get the mount armor as well.

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So it's a really cool way of helping out some of the smaller and mid-sized streamers out there that, you know,

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
really benefit from some of these programs.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And it's great to see all these new faces as they actually jump into Vessel of Hatred.

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The next thing we do also want to talk about is a cool promotion that we're actually doing with Trolly here in the U.S.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Trolly actually makes some candy.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They're like Sour Bright crawlers and things like that.

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's actually some really cool weapon skins available if you actually purchase Trolly-specific products here in the U.S.

139
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We actually have them here on set, but you can see all the cool weapon skins.

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But if you actually purchase these and you'll see that they're clearly marked with like Diablo 4, they've got the Spirit Porn on them.

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And you can actually end up taking a photo of your receipt, going to a specific site, and then you'll end up getting kind of the rewards in-game.

142
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And you also have a chance of actually winning an Xbox too, which is really cool.

143
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And this is a cool promotion that I think Xbox is actually doing across multitudes of titles, including like World of Warcraft, for instance,

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
because this was actually going on with the War Within here at Blizzard.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, yeah, like if you're in the U.S., look for Trolly products.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Thankfully, we have a whole bunch of bags here.

147
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So expect me to actually be eating these throughout the stream.

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We've had like seven bags in the last two days.

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, as we've been like prepping for the stream, like this has been my whole entire diet.

150
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Actually, no, I've been eating normal food.

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But at the same time, this is like my kryptonite right here.

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So expect me to be eating these throughout the stream.

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's my favorite stream because we have snacks now.

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So I'm like, this is perfect.

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is perfect.

156
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But one thing, again, we wanted to mention, which is the release date.

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I think we have a release date map here.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So, yeah, as you guys can see on October 7th in Irvine at 4 p.m. Pacific or Pacific time or California time, if you want to say it,

159
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is when the actual expansion is going to be launching.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is a global launch.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So everyone is coming out at the same time.

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The world is round.

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So you can't get everyone in on October 8th.

164
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So that's why there's some in on October 7th.

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But we wanted to make sure that we could get as many people in on October 8th.

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And, of course, a little earlier on October 7th.

167
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But everyone's coming out at the exact same time.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So looking forward to everyone jumping in.

169
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We do have an action-packed show today.

170
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
A lot of stuff to cover.

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We are going to be hitting up on the patch 2.0 PTR changes first.

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's first up in the agenda.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Because we have so many things to share, I will note, this is our 20th live stream for Diablo 4 that we've ever done, which is really cool.

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And this is also our first time we're actually streaming on TikTok.

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We already stream on X.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We stream on Twitch.

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And we stream on YouTube.

178
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So this is kind of a nice, momentous occasion.

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But because of how much content we have and how many guests we have, we are going to say that we will have some small little breaks while we actually mic new people up, bring them into the studio, and then swap them out for other things.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But we are going to be talking first about patch 2.0 PTR and the feedback that we actually received from players.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And then separately, we're also going to be talking about season 6, season of Hatred Rising.

182
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And separately, we will finish off the show with all the Vessel of Hatred features and going into a little bit more of a deeper dive, something that you were talking about, Brent.

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, yeah.

184
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I can't wait.

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I mean, we have so many people coming in that we're having to pack them in rows.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, exactly.

187
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're going to see multiple levels of people in the studio.

188
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So we're going to take a quick break while we get the first group in for our patch 2.0 PTR feedback overview.

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So we'll see you in a bit.

190
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What do you think?

191
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What do you think?

192
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
,ה slash finance, i'll see you in the chair.

193
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay, good.

194
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
beating.

195
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Alright, we'll break down the beam really great.

196
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We are going to break down the beam like a 좋을 opposite pole.

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It is it?

198
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes, that's it.

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It is gonna fall nữa.

200
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You'll see it.

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

202
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Thank you.

203
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Thank you.

204
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Can you hear me?

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yea, I'm just kidding.

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Not much.

207
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You have, say.

208
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yes.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes.

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Awesome.

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I appreciate everyone bearing with us as we get people mic'd up.

212
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We're going to be doing this a couple times throughout this stream, but we're here to

213
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
talk about the PTR learnings from Patch 2.0 PTR, which we had earlier this month.

214
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Super beneficial.

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
PTRs have been great for us since we've started actually hosting them for Diablo 4.

216
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And of course, this one was a very, very big one because we have a lot of big changes coming

217
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
with Vessel of Hatred in Season 6.

218
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But I know we want to jump straight into it.

219
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So Aislinn, I know you're going to start us off and talk about some progression changes.

220
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes, I am.

221
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So let's, yeah, like you said, Adam, let's jump right into that.

222
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, actually, before we do that, sorry, sorry, sorry.

223
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I just realized no one knows who we are.

224
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, yeah.

225
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There we go.

226
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I was just like, wait a minute.

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Of course, we have some familiar faces, but if you guys want to do quick intros.

228
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah.

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Hi, I'm Colin.

230
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm a lead designer.

231
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey, I'm Aislinn.

232
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm a systems designer.

233
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hi, I'm Charles.

234
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm a class designer.

235
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Hey, y'all.

236
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm Anthony.

237
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm an associate class designer.

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Awesome.

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Great.

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There we go.

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Now we got everyone settled.

242
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Aislinn, do you want to talk about some of the progression changes?

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes, absolutely.

244
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So, Adam, like you said, the PTR has been just fantastic for us.

245
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's given us so much data and the feedback you guys give is just pivotal to us launching

246
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
in the state we want to see the game in.

247
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And, you know, everyone wants to see the game in.

248
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And so, yeah, let's talk about it.

249
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's talk about some changes we've made because of it.

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So, first of all, monster intensity.

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Something we saw in the early game was people weren't noticing the changes in monster intensity

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
because people were skipping through difficulties fairly quickly.

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And so we've decided to move monster intensity from scaling over normal hard expert and penitent

254
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
to scaling over torment one through four because you're going to be progressing through torments

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
a little bit slower.

256
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So you're going to be able to feel the intensity changes, I think, a little more potently.

257
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah, there's a bit more jumps, right?

258
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And again, the intensity system was essentially monsters just become a little bit more reliable

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
in their damage.

261
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Right.

262
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
They start to predict your movement a little bit more on the projectiles.

263
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's not a massive change, but it should sort of make the monsters feel a little bit more

264
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
aggressive and dangerous.

265
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah, they just become a little more lethal, I think, ultimately, beyond, you know, numerical changes.

266
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Second up I want to talk about is one that I'm really, really happy and excited about, actually,

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
is that elites, unique elites, and super elites are three different types of elites you can

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
actually fight, if you know that or not.

269
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's a thing.

270
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And previously, they all did very different amounts of damage from one another.

271
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Like, for example, a super elite might deal actually two times the amount of damage of

272
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
a normal elite.

273
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And what that was causing was when an elite spawned an affix, like lightning enchanted or poison

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
or whatever, the super elites would do two times more damage with those affixes.

275
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But you didn't really have any way to tell, right?

276
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There was no way to tell if an affix was spawned by an elite or a super elite.

277
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And so kind of seemingly randomly, an affix might deal two times more damage to you out

278
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
of nowhere.

279
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And so what we've done is we've normalized the damage that all of these different elite

280
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
types actually deal.

281
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So that when you do see the affixes that they're spewing out, you can expect the damage you're

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
going to receive.

283
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Like, you know how much it's going to hit you for.

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Way more consistent.

285
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Way more consistent.

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Way more predictable.

287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Which is really helpful for not getting randomly one shot.

288
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah.

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Our favorite.

290
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah.

291
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah.

292
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And then finally, on difficulty, we have some changes to standard difficulty tiers.

293
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We know some of you guys are looking for a challenge.

294
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So let's take a look at what a challenge looks like.

295
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,000
All right.

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So we have a level one character here in Kyovishad going to the statue to change their difficulty.

297
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So what are they going to change it to?

298
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, before they could access normal hard and expert, but now they can access penitent

299
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
at level one.

300
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's what we only play.

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Why would we play anything else?

302
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yes.

303
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So you have to beat the base campaign on your account once, and then you can go into penitent.

304
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And let's see how that turns out for this person.

305
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh yeah.

306
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm sure it's going great.

307
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Just a helltide.

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Just a few demons.

309
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh.

310
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
A few too many demons.

311
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Just a couple few too many demons.

312
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah.

313
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Mythic uniques.

314
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So you can do penitent at level one now.

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's pretty hard, guys.

316
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So if you plan to go into level one, be prepared.

317
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But seriously, we know people really wanted to be able to push their builds as far as they

318
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
could as early as they could.

319
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah.

320
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And now you can.

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So whenever you feel like you're ready for penitent during your leveling journey, hop in

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
there and see how you do.

323
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah.

324
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I know that was one of the biggest points of feedback we got during this PTR, which

325
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
was like, hey, we would like to see if penitent wasn't gated way further down the line and

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
if it could be brought in.

327
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So it's now available at level one.

328
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And as we've shown in the footage, it can be difficult.

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But I think what's nice is if someone creates alts and they end up finding a bunch of mythic

330
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
uniques and stuff, which you can use at earlier levels, you then can at least potentially start

331
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
off in penitent a little bit earlier and stay with a higher difficulty in that type of way,

332
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,000
which is nice.

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We really want to embrace the sort of choose your difficulty that we really liked with

335
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
the mine cages in season five, four and five.

336
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And again, to your point, alts just are able to speed run their way to max level right

337
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
by playing at a really hard difficulty.

338
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So it should feel a lot better.

339
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And it feels great to just hop into penitent early, like when you're capable of doing it.

340
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It does.

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's just awesome.

342
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah.

343
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We don't necessarily expect everyone to play at penitent.

344
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's really hard to play at your own risk.

345
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes.

346
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah.

347
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Your character needs to be pretty good.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah.

349
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah.

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,000
All right.

351
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Let's talk about some itemization changes.

352
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So we got a lot of feedback that once you got to max level and you were starting that

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
ancestral grind, you were stuck with these non-ancestral items for a pretty long time.

354
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And we do like that, but we know that people want to see the journey for those non-ancestral

355
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
items to be a little punchier.

356
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And so we've made some targeted changes here to ensure that non-ancestral legendaries have

357
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
more, well, punch to them.

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So we've increased the amount of master working you can put on a non-ancestral legendary from

359
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
four to eight.

360
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
We are also allowing them to be tempered twice.

361
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Previously, both of those values were exclusive to ancestral items, but now non-ancestrals

362
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
can go up to that.

363
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Additionally, we saw that people were going to like the boss ladder or they were just

364
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
finding uniques out in the world.

365
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And it didn't feel like they were dropping as ancestral as often as they should have.

366
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Right, because they're so rare.

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Right, they're so rare.

368
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And you want finding a unique item to be an exciting moment.

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And so we've tripled the chance for them to drop as ancestral.

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And this should help a lot, especially during the boss ladder, when you're killing these

371
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
uber bosses and they're dropping lots of uniques.

372
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
A lot more of them are going to turn out to be ancestral.

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Definitely.

374
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And this should mean that once you're starting around level 60, you have a lot more progression

375
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
on your equipment that sort of bridges the gap to ancestral.

376
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We also heard a lot of feedback that that second tempered affix really is what enables

377
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
your build to come online.

378
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And that's what we're trying to do with the system of ancestral is that you can get your

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
build online.

380
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah.

381
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But then there's still items that you can chase that just enhance that build.

382
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Right.

383
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And we saw that like not having that second tempered affix and not having those eight

384
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
masterwork ranks really sort of hindered your ability to get that build online to get into

385
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the fun and start blasting.

386
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah.

387
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No, that's a great point.

388
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Because we don't want you to feel like you have to find ancestrals for your build to

389
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,000
function.

390
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And, you know, this change is working towards making that true.

391
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Definitely.

392
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So you still have those items you can chase, but you can still get those endgame builds

393
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
online pretty quickly.

394
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yep.

395
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,000
For sure.

396
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And finally on itemization, we are adding some scrolls of restoration to the season journey.

397
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The scrolls of restoration are the scrolls of tempering that we talked about at Gamescom.

398
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You can use them to reset the tempering chances on an item.

399
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And we wanted to add these to the season journey.

400
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So you could just have a couple of deterministic ways to acquire them and use them on your gear.

401
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And this, of course, is not the only place you can earn these scroll of restoration.

402
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,000
No.

403
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You know, you can earn them throughout the world.

404
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
There's a small drop chance.

405
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And we'll be actually talking about another way of earning them later on as well.

406
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

407
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Definitely.

408
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah.

409
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So I think one thing that I'm excited about on the unique changes, if you equate greater

410
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Apexes in Season 5 to Ancestral, you're actually going to have a higher chance to get an Ancestral

411
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
unique compared to getting a greater Apex on a unique than live, right?

412
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Right.

413
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So it means that uniques are really exciting.

414
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You might actually get, like, the Staff of Endless Rage, for example.

415
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Maybe you're not playing a Fireball Sorc, but now you're like, oh, well, I have an Ancestral

416
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
version of this unique.

417
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That's huge.

418
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's pretty good.

419
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

420
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

421
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So it really, like, kind of gets you to experiment a little bit more.

422
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And we really like that aspect about those uniques sometimes being a lot more powerful.

423
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah.

424
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
No.

425
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's, it's, we want that moment when you see a unique on the ground to be really fun

426
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,000
and exciting.

427
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And seeing it drop as an Ancestral with greater Apexes is about as exciting as it gets for

428
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,000
uniques.

429
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,000
That's pretty cool.

430
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
All right.

431
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Let's talk about some player power changes based on PTR feedback.

432
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So I want to start by framing our goals for Torment difficulties.

433
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So Torment 1, we want all content to be available in the game.

434
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You can fight Lilith.

435
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You can fight the Boss Ladder.

436
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You can go to the Dark Citadel, you know, et cetera.

437
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
All these activities are available.

438
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Torment 4 is intended to be aspirational content.

439
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And what that means is you've already unlocked everything in the game when you enter Torment

440
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,000
1.

441
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But Torment 4 is, like, the essence of Diablo, like, build crafting, where you're just pushing

442
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
your character as far as you can go.

443
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And Torment 4 exists for that purpose, for people who want to push their character as far

444
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
as they can go.

445
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And with that said, and the reason why I'm saying this is because we were seeing that

446
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
people were getting to Torment 4 way faster and way easier than we were hoping for in the

447
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
PTR.

448
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And, you know, which is just another great, like, it's great that we did the PTR because

449
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,000
we saw that.

450
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And with that all said, we've made some changes to kind of keep Torment 4 this, you know,

451
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
really challenging and exciting thing to reach.

452
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We've reverted the skill damage bonus from main stat back to what it was in Season 5.

453
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So we had actually doubled it in the PTR, but we found that that was just giving players

454
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,000
too much power.

455
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Too much.

456
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So we sent it back.

457
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
And we also pulled back on Legendary Glyph power a bit.

458
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Colin, do you want to talk about that?

459
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah.

460
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So we reduced the scaling on the Glyphs quite a bit because we found that it was really

461
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
devaluing a lot of the aspect rolls or rolls on your gear.

462
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Like when you're getting 2,000 additive damage from a Glyph, it's really hard to actually feel

463
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
anything on your gear through tempering or through those affix that are dropping.

464
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So essentially what we've done is pair that back.

465
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We've redistributed it.

466
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
We'll cover that a little bit on where we put some of that power.

467
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But overall, we think this feels a lot better.

468
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Glyphs aren't just carrying like 80% of your power on a build.

469
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It just feels a lot better so that it doesn't feel as sort of mandatory that I have to get

470
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
all five Glyphs and level them up to actually be pushing difficulty.

471
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's a lot more about what are the aspects you have, what are the uniques you have,

472
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
what are the nodes you're actually getting on the Paragon board.

473
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I think it feels a lot better.

474
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah.

475
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And I think one of the important things to say about this is that it's really awesome

476
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
to get a tremendous amount of power from one source.

477
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But because there are so many different sources of power in the game, if one source gives

478
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
too much power, it makes the other sources feel kind of unimportant.

479
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

480
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And that's not fun.

481
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So we want to make sure that every source of power in the game is contributing to your build

482
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
in very meaningful ways.

483
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah.

484
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And so this change is helping other sources of power feel really punchy.

485
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Definitely.

486
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah.

487
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Awesome.

488
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I know tons of changes here with player power, tons of changes with like progression,

489
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
including difficulty and itemization.

490
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Do we have anything else on progression?

491
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I think one thing I think that's really important to touch on is the torment goals here, right?

492
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah.

493
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Because it's a definite fundamental shift from season five in that you think about world

494
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
tier three into world tier four and you're sort of racing to get to world tier four as

495
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
fast as possible because that's where all the best items can drop.

496
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Yeah.

497
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And we've sort of just changed that to torment one is where all the best items can drop.

498
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's where everything unlocks.

499
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But essentially torment two, three, and four increase the odds of those things happening.

500
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So it's just efficiency, right?

501
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah.

502
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We don't necessarily want to say you must get to torment four to experience the game or

503
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
to get the best drops in the game.

504
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Right.

505
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Similar to world tier four in season five.

506
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's very different feeling.

507
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So we're excited to see how that plays out.

508
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And we want to sort of see what you all think as well.

509
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah.

510
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And just to reiterate, you know, all of the content, all of the best gear can be found in

511
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,000
torment one.

512
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So if that's where your build feels most comfortable farming, that's great.

513
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You can still achieve all your goals.

514
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You can really max out your character there.

515
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
It just, you get a reward for pushing this harder difficulty by more efficiency.

516
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah.

517
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And that's like what affords torment four the means to, or like the space to be really hard.

518
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Definitely.

519
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's because you don't have to get there.

520
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And so it can be really, really challenging.

521
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And, you know, some players really love that.

522
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And that's awesome.

523
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Definitely.

524
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Awesome.

525
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Well, I know the next topic we want to talk about is some of the big system changes that

526
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
are actually coming with Vessel of Hatred, but, and also changes that we're applying post-PTR

527
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
from things that we actually learned.

528
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Colin, you want to walk us through and start us off with some of the Paragon stuff?

529
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah, absolutely.

530
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So again, we got a ton of feedback from the PTR and we took a look at Paragon.

531
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That was one of the bigger changes that we made where we capped the boards because we feel

532
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
like that gives us a lot more space to increase the power of each of these boards and make

533
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
the choice more about what is the board you're looking for.

534
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So what we've done here is we've added a bunch of normal nodes.

535
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So those are things like stats that empower those glyphs to upgrade that legendary glyph

536
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,000
radius.

537
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We added them.

538
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It was kind of sad, like there weren't actually a lot of nodes to flesh it out and sort of

539
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
build up that Paragon, that extra glyph range that you're going to get from upgrading

540
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
it to legendary.

541
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So we've done that.

542
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We added around eight to every board.

543
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And then the starting board, I think we went to like 12 or something like that.

544
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Just because, you know, the starting board should feel really good with that first glyph.

545
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
The next thing we've done is we've taken a look at a lot of the rare and magic nodes and

546
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
we've just made them generically more useful.

547
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So you think about like two handed bludgeoning damage on the barbarian is like, okay, like

548
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I guess I guess I can only benefit if I'm doing this one very specific thing.

549
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And we've just opened that up to say damage, right?

550
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That's going to scale everything across your character as opposed to like while you're doing

551
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
this sort of obscure thing.

552
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So we think that feels a lot better.

553
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We've also just sort of taken a look at what are the affixes we're giving?

554
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Like fucking potion healing.

555
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Like I know you're all going to be really sad.

556
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That was my favorite stuff.

557
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I know you're all super sad to see that we've taken potion healing out.

558
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But we've just changed it to healing received.

559
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We've also just taken a look at things like damage reduction from dots and made it damage reduction.

560
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So it should be a lot more generically useful and those boards should feel a lot more punchy

561
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and open-ended, which we really like.

562
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And that's sort of doubling down on the spirit of what we've done with season four atomization,

563
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,000
right?

564
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Just sort of taking back some of these conditional things that aren't necessarily adding a ton

565
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
of value to your build identity.

566
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Just opening things up.

567
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And then the next thing we've done is we talked about redistributing some of the power on those

568
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
glyphs.

569
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And we've taken a look at all of our nodes, all of magic and rare nodes, and we've just

570
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
buffed all of them.

571
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So we've doubled all the additive bonuses on rare and magic nodes.

572
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We've increased the damage reduction values by about 1.5x.

573
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So they should feel a lot more chunky.

574
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And as you're journeying through Paragon, right, it should feel like you have more options

575
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
than to just bum rush every glyph socket and every legendary node.

576
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
There should be some pretty punchy damage sources that you can get, damage reduction sources

577
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
you can get.

578
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
We've also done things like all the resistance nodes you have on the Paragon board actually

579
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
give max resistance as well now.

580
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So it's pretty powerful.

581
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
We've done a lot of changes there.

582
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So this is one of the first steps we're taking to really improve the Paragon system with the

583
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
new sort of philosophy of we want you to pick what boards you want.

584
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And we expect to be updating more in the future.

585
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

586
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And I think that this harkens back to what we were just saying, which is that, you know,

587
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
it's really fun for all of your sources of power to be meaningful.

588
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And so we're basically just taking, like, the tons and tons of power that was in glyphs

589
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and kind of slightly redistributing it to Paragon.

590
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So going through your Paragon board is just more interesting and fun.

591
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Definitely.

592
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Cool.

593
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Next up, we got, I think, Infernal Hordes.

594
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah.

595
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So if you remember, Infernal Hordes was under construction during the PTR as we were fitting

596
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
in, like, how does this kind of work with the greater equipment chest turning into ancestral

597
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,000
items.

598
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And there are three things that we really wanted to tackle as a part of this release,

599
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,000
right?

600
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Infernal Hordes is an eternal game mode.

601
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So we wanted to take the learnings we got from Season 5 and apply it to this next update.

602
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So one of the things we saw was that loot was just dominating the reward landscape here,

603
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
like getting 200 legendaries from one source of activity is cool for Season 5, and it's

604
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the brand new activity for Season 5.

605
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That's awesome.

606
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But we wanted to just readjust it, refit it back in.

607
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We still have the codex of power that lets you store all these legendary powers.

608
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So we felt like we wanted to take more of a quality over quantity approach here.

609
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And one of the things that was sort of frustrating about that quality miss was that you didn't

610
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
really have a way to reliably target those unique items that were coming out of Infernal

611
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Hordes.

612
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
If you think about it, you had to open a chest and just hope that you were going to get

613
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
one of the unique items out of this chest.

614
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And that sort of led to a frustrating and tedious reward flow where you're just constantly opening

615
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
up these 28th of chests over and over and over.

616
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I know I've spent probably more time opening the material chest than actually...

617
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I mean, I think that's everyone's favorite pastime, just running around the material chest.

618
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah, putting the cool down on the chest like, oh my god, just give me my fucking shit.

619
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So it takes forever.

620
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
So we've taken a look at how we're going to actually deliver these keys.

621
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
We've taken them out of the crafting system, but they're not too rare.

622
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
They're just uncommonly found throughout the world.

623
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
We want this to be like an oh shit moment when the key drops, just because you're going to

624
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
get a ton of XP from killing the Hordes.

625
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You're going to get a ton of materials and a ton of items as well.

626
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So we think that will make the keys feel a lot more interesting and it's not going to

627
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
blow your inventory as much.

628
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Yeah.

629
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You really want to use them when you get them.

630
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So the next part here is if we could go back to the slide.

631
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh, if we could go to Infernal Hordes.

632
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Infernal Hordes.

633
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,000
There we go.

634
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The council boss, no matter what, as long as you kill that council, they're going to

635
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
drop dungeon boss loot, which is going to be legendaries, crafting materials, gold, etc.

636
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
on top of the Infernal Horde unique items.

637
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And that's going to scale with torment.

638
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So guaranteed, every single time you kill that council, you are going to get unique items

639
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
that are specific to Infernal Hordes.

640
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That's great, because those Infernal Horde uniques are pretty sick.

641
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Definitely.

642
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So no more waiting at the chest to get that drop.

643
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's just going to happen.

644
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And it feels a lot more like the boss ladder, where it's like, okay, I want to get Infernal

645
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Horde unique items.

646
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm going to be able to reliably get those and get a pull at the slot machine there.

647
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And then the next thing here is we've updated the chest.

648
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So the chests of greater equipment are going to drop the scrolls of restoration or re-tempering.

649
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So you're going to be able to get them reliably from the Infernal Hordes, not just the Dark

650
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Citadel.

651
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And that should feel pretty meaty and good.

652
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And then we've also guaranteed some amount of ancestral items from that greater equipment

653
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,000
chest.

654
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And ancestral items are very much more coveted than just greater affix items.

655
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So that should feel pretty meaty.

656
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And then the chest of materials is now just going to convert all your aether into materials.

657
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You don't have to constantly open the chest.

658
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Turn it into a bunch of master working materials, gems.

659
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It should feel a lot more snappy and less time looting, more time playing.

660
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And the gold chest is the same.

661
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah, because it just gives you a bunch.

662
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Next up, I know we have the reward stuff.

663
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
We kind of spoiled here.

664
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I know.

665
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
What the hell?

666
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah.

667
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So we can just skip this because everyone knows.

668
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah.

669
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So rewards.

670
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
This is just a bunch of miscellaneous tuning and making the game feel better and more rewarding.

671
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah.

672
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So we've significantly increased the ancestral drop rate from Nightmare Dungeons and Whispers.

673
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Thank you to the person who ran a thousand Nightmare Dungeons.

674
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah.

675
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That's right.

676
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Oh my god.

677
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Yeah.

678
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Definitely fixed the problem there and that should feel a lot more rewarding.

679
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
We've also added just experience to the Nightmare Dungeon completion, which just feels better as you're grinding that paragon.

680
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Also while you're leveling up, it's like a pretty good hit of XP.

681
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And then we've also done miscellaneous buffs to just miscellaneous things.

682
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So Hellborn will drop loot.

683
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Butcher is going to drop a guaranteed axe, I believe, of Butcher's Axe.

684
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
The world boss, Treasure Goblins, those are all going to drop a lot better loot.

685
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's also going to scale with Torment, which should feel good.

686
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah, I mean, it makes sense for these, like, I guess the Hellborn's not exactly a random encounter.

687
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It's the world boss, but like the Butcher and the Treasure Goblin, these big meaty encounters.

688
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
It makes sense for these to occur and you're like, give me good loot because this is uncommon.

689
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This doesn't happen that frequently.

690
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I want it to be amazing.

691
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's an exciting moment and the loot should reflect that.

692
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah.

693
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I love that loot explosion.

694
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah.

695
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,000
The Treasure Goblin.

696
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Nothing beats finding a Treasure Goblin at, like, level 5.

697
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yeah.

698
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Just chasing it around using your, like, basic attack.

699
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, and it guarantee drops a Legendary no matter what level you are.

700
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So it should feel pretty good.

701
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
The next thing here is we really love how players or how you all have sort of embraced the Stronghold experience bonus.

702
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
We've actually just done that across the game.

703
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So campaign feels really good in terms of experience granted.

704
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Side quest should feel really good, especially in Nihantu.

705
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But what we saw with the Stronghold experience in the PTR is that two levels felt a little bit aggressive and, like, sort of forced you to do Strongholds over and over and over.

706
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
We've just paired that back down to 1.25 levels, which is still really meaty.

707
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Like, you're getting an entire level from doing these.

708
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Oh, yeah.

709
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It's really fulfilling what we had hoped Strongholds were going to provide, which is an alternative means to level.

710
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
If you want to ride around the open world and do a bunch of Strongholds, that's absolutely a viable way to level up now.

711
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
We think that, like, all the quest content in general just feels a lot better because they're a lot more generous there.

712
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
The other change I'll note here is that a bulk of that experience is going to be from killing the boss, and it's a first-time reward.

713
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So that means you're not going to be able to sort of, you know, cheese running Strongholds over and over and over.

714
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Thank you, Rax, for showing that with your friends from your chat that did that in 20 minutes.

715
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
We rolled the record.

716
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It was a good video, in all fairness.

717
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Cool.

718
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And then the next one here is we heard a ton of feedback that rare and magic items just felt like they're adding a lot of noise to Torment.

719
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
We're dropping a lot more of them.

720
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Now they just get auto-servaged in Torment.

721
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Hooray.

722
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Get them out of here.

723
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, get them out.

724
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And then the next one is just a nice quality of life.

725
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
The Paragon glyphs now drop from the pit.

726
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So when you're doing a bunch of pit runs, you're also going to be getting glyphs.

727
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It just means you don't really have to, like, go out and do other things if you have a bunch of keys for the pit.

728
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah.

729
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I mean, that's really nice, too, because, you know, theoretically you could enter the pit and not actually have a glyph, but now you will.

730
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So you can find one and level up if that's what happens.

731
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Awesome.

732
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And I know, last but not least, we have kind of itemization and crap.

733
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This is some big stuff here that I know will excite players for sure.

734
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah.

735
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So one of the things we've heard a ton from the player base and you all is that I wish I could make a Mythic Unique deterministically.

736
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
If I do everything in a season, if I kill Uber Lilith, if I do the season's journey, I want to be able to get a Mythic Unique.

737
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And we saw this as an opportunity to essentially create an identity between the runecrafting of Mythic Uniques and the blacksmith.

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We moved it from the alchemist to the blacksmith, the blacksmith version of crafting Mythic Uniques.

739
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So now what you're going to be able to do is you're going to be able to take two Respondent Sparks to the blacksmith and get a random Mythic Unique.

740
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
That means no matter what, as long as you do everything in the season, you're going to get a Mythic Unique.

741
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And if you take those Respondent Sparks and you decide, I really want a specific Mythic Unique, you'll be able to take a set of runes and actually pick which one.

742
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And what that does is the runes are a lot more flexible.

743
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
They can be traded.

744
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You can also get some incremental progress because they drop a lot more frequently than Mythic Unique or Sparks in general.

745
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So what this means is you now have two really clear means to sort of target Mythic Uniques.

746
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And you now have a guaranteed way to make a Mythic Unique at the end of a season, which we think will feel really good.

747
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Something that's kind of cool about that is that it gives runes this intrinsic trade value, which I kind of love.

748
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Like they have this big purpose towards crafting one of the best items in the game, which is really cool.

749
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I finally can get my Starless Skies.

750
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Cool.

751
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And then the next one here is you're going to be getting a lot of salvage in Torment because everything is getting auto-salvaged.

752
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So we figured, you know what, we should probably give you some purpose and value to that salvage.

753
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And now you can take it to the blacksmith and forge random legendary equipment at the blacksmith.

754
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah, this is huge.

755
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I love this change.

756
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And it also has a chance to be unique or Mythic and sometimes ancestral.

757
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So it's definitely a great place to dump all that excess salvage that you have.

758
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And then the next one here is more just sort of a quality of life and nicety.

759
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
We added runes and we're putting way more sockets on gear.

760
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We've just allowed you to add sockets to gear with just the general salvage material.

761
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You don't need scattered prisms anymore.

762
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Scattered prisms are required for ancestral items.

763
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And that just essentially means, you know, ah, I'm missing a socket.

764
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You can pretty easily add one.

765
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And then the next one here is mostly quality of life for alt characters.

766
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But the jeweler no longer has a level requirement to engage with the jeweler.

767
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Previously on the PTR you had to like trade gear to your main character, add a socket.

768
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It was super tedious.

769
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And we just made it not like that.

770
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Awesome.

771
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So tons of big changes coming across a multitude of systems within D4.

772
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Thanks to a lot of great feedback that we got from all the players within the community, content creators, etc.

773
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So thank you guys so much for that.

774
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Thank you, Colin, for walking us through that.

775
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Next up we want to talk about some of the class changes and everything.

776
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And so Charles here is going to walk us through it.

777
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah, I'd love to talk about some of the class changes that we saw in the PTR.

778
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Once again, I wanted to thank all of the players who, you know, gave a lot of detail, detailed feedback,

779
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
a lot of data on, you know, how classes were performing, all the different builds,

780
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
and the new items, new effects, and all that kind of stuff, new skills.

781
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It's been really helpful in helping to make sure that we make all our class designs as fun and engaging as possible.

782
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I do want to say that, you know, this patch is huge.

783
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
There's lots of changes, you know, as I said, a lot of new class stuff,

784
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
but a lot of new system stuff across the whole game.

785
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And so we do expect some level of, like, volatility here.

786
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And, you know, when a lot of things change, there's a lot of unknowns.

787
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And so that's just the mindset we're approaching this patch with.

788
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And what we're going to talk about here is not a complete detailed list of everything that we've changed from the PTR to live.

789
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It's just kind of some samples and kind of talking through our learnings and what we saw on the class design team

790
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and what we're thinking about.

791
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And so make sure you check out the full patch notes once we're done with the stream.

792
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And also, if you, a lot of the changes came in the PTR initially,

793
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
so definitely check out those if you're unfamiliar because there's tons of class changes there as well.

794
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Oh, yeah.

795
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Okay. So starting with the Barbarian, we generally saw that Barbarian class was a little bit too weak on the PTR.

796
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And I think even on Season 5, I think it's just generally considered a little too weak.

797
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Historically, though, it's been one of our stronger classes.

798
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But, you know, in recent seasons, it's fallen a little bit on harder times.

799
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So a lot of our focus here is buffs to some underutilized skills and legendaries and uniques.

800
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So we've got updates to Upheaval to make it just a little bit more punchy, hits a little bit harder.

801
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,000
We've got updates to some of the uniques that talk to other core skills like Hammer of the Ancients and Double Swing to give them a little bit more damage boost as well.

802
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And finally, there's a buff to the Martial Vigor passive.

803
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That is a passive in the skill tree that gives you some damage reduction from elite enemies, including bosses.

804
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And it might seem pretty small on paper.

805
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's just 4% to 6%.

806
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But for every skill rank you have in that, you get that much more.

807
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And really, when you're fighting the late game tormented bosses and high torment tiers,

808
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
it's going to be a pretty noticeable amount of survivability against those boss fights for Barbarians.

809
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah, those passive skills add up really quickly when you start getting a bunch of ranks in them and stuff.

810
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So, for sure.

811
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Absolutely.

812
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Moving on to the Druid.

813
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
We also think the Druid was a little bit on the weaker end of the classes.

814
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I think there was a few bugs on the PTR that we're addressing as we go live

815
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
where some of their effects, specifically in the Paragon and some of the key passives,

816
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
weren't quite working exactly how we intended.

817
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So they might have been a little bit weaker due to that on the PTR specifically.

818
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So we're definitely addressing those.

819
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I also wanted to talk about Nature's Fury.

820
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
This is a key passive that whenever you cast an Earth or Storm skill,

821
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
there's a chance to cast the same skill of, or a chance to cast a skill of the opposite type.

822
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And this was causing some unintended interactions with one of the unique items,

823
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
the Earthbreaker ring,

824
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
that ended up proccing or triggering Nature's Fury way more often than we intended.

825
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
That's because we have this concept of casts

826
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
where you actually need to press the button and then,

827
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
hey, you did one cast.

828
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And whenever we do something like auto casts, which is like,

829
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
hey, I triggered a free skill with Nature's Fury,

830
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
that shouldn't kind of recursively trigger or trigger the other effects that are looking for casts.

831
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
But in that particular interaction it was.

832
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And so we have fixed that interaction,

833
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
but then thrown some pretty big buffs to those items and the things affected in that build.

834
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
We still expect those kind of things, especially landslide builds that use this a lot,

835
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
to still be very powerful builds going forward.

836
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
But we just didn't want that one particular unintended interaction to be happening.

837
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And that kind of overshines, you know, all the builds, right?

838
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Yeah.

839
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
When you have like one build that's, you know, crazy over, you know, the top, so.

840
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Exactly, yeah.

841
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Especially whenever there's one build that's so dominant,

842
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
it really makes it feel like,

843
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
hey, I'm playing the class wrong if I'm not doing this.

844
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And that's not something that we want.

845
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We want you to be able to play all the different ways of playing the classes,

846
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and feel like it's a valid and viable choice to compete or to complete the game.

847
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Some of the other changes on Druid as well.

848
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
We've got some updates to Great Staff of the Crone.

849
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
This is one of my favorite items that lets your Claw and Stormstrike build

850
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
kind of synergize really nicely.

851
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
We've got just a lot more damage on Werewolf skills through the Lust for Carnage Paragon node.

852
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Basically the same functionality, but just added 50% bonus damage there.

853
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
We saw Werewolf was particularly,

854
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
it was particularly falling behind.

855
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And an update to the Untamed Legendary Paragon node.

856
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
This is the new one that talks to companion skills.

857
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Previously it just gave skill ranks,

858
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
which kind of fell off as you got a lot of skill ranks.

859
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Now it's just multiplicative damage,

860
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and I'm really looking forward to seeing some companion Druids in the new season,

861
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
especially with the new key passive.

862
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
All right, moving on to the Necromancer.

863
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So the Necromancer is a class that I think we saw a lot of variety for like Blood, Bone, and Shadow builds.

864
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
A lot of those were competing very well.

865
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But a Necromancer is really all about minions, right?

866
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And unfortunately we saw minion builds really falling behind from where we want.

867
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And we know that minion builds are like the most appealing part of a Necromancer.

868
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And so on the class design team, we're really committed to making sure that minion Necromancer is good,

869
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and we're going to see some massive buffs to this patch,

870
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
and we're going to continue monitoring to make sure that the minion fantasy is really a powerful and compelling one.

871
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We also saw that Necromancer was one of the squishier classes.

872
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It had a little bit less defensive oomph than we really wanted.

873
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And so we've made some updates here to Reap.

874
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It's going to give a little bit longer damage reduction,

875
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
just makes that a little bit more usable for that function.

876
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Same with Necrotic Fortitude, it gives a little bit more barrier.

877
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
This is kind of a passive barrier generation, so just a little bit more survivability in that late game.

878
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And then the rest of it here is just talking about minion buffs, right?

879
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
We've got Kaylin's Edict, the key passive.

880
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
This is going to...previously it just gave you attack speed for your minions.

881
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Now it's also going to give you bonus multiplicative damage for all your minions.

882
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
A bunch of the legendaries and uniques that talked to minions, like Ring of Mendel and Shademist,

883
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
that damage is now properly attributed to your minions rather than the Necromancer themselves.

884
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Which means if you have bonus Golem damage, for instance, and your Golem triggers Ring of Mendel,

885
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
it's now going to benefit properly and it's going to be multiplied up by those multipliers.

886
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So pretty big buffs for those legendaries and uniques.

887
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Yeah, that's a lot of power for sure.

888
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Oh, absolutely.

889
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So moving on, we've got...next class we'll talk about the Rogue.

890
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I think the Rogue in general was performing pretty well across the board in the PTR.

891
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I think we got a lot of positive feedback, like, hey, yeah, Rogue feels great.

892
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Like, just, you know...

893
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Spin to win.

894
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yes, Spin to win.

895
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

896
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The Dance of Knives skill in particular.

897
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
My favorite build.

898
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's awesome.

899
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Yeah, I was really happy with where Dance of Knives landed as the new skill.

900
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It found a lot of use in a variety of builds and people have a lot of fun playing with it.

901
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
We did notice a little bit of the melee-focused builds with Flurry and Twisting Blades falling behind

902
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
just a little bit.

903
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So a few of our changes here are focused on enhancing the legendaries that talk to those

904
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
two, Encircling Blades and Blade Dancers.

905
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
In terms of key passives, we saw Victimized did have a bug that caused its damage scaling

906
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
to be higher than intended.

907
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And so we have fixed that math calculation on how it kind of scales damage based on other

908
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
damage because it was really just a little bit too dominant.

909
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And now we think with this update it'll still be a competitive choice, but it won't completely

910
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
outshine every other key passive on the Rogue.

911
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And some nice little buffs here to Reign of Arrows just to make it work a little bit better

912
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
with Imbuement skills.

913
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Love me some Reign of Arrows.

914
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's a very flashy skill, especially with all those colors with the Imbuements on it.

915
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
All right.

916
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And finally, the Sorcerer.

917
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
The Sorcerer was definitely the strongest class I think we saw on the PTR by a fair margin.

918
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Just a little bit.

919
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It was quite strong.

920
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
People were having a lot of fun with Sorcerer builds, especially with the new key passive,

921
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Enlightenment.

922
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And Enlightenment had an issue where it's all about alternating skill casts.

923
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Okay, you cast a Fire skill, you cast a Lightning skill, you cast a Cold skill, and you get these

924
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
stacks really quickly.

925
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Unfortunately, it was stacking up unintentionally from some of those auto casts that we were

926
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
talking about earlier with Nature's Fury.

927
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Where when you trigger bonus casts from like unstable currents, it was actually ramping up

928
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
the Enlightenment way too fast.

929
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And so we fixed that interaction, but we think despite that, Enlightenment is still one of

930
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
the strongest key passives of sorts.

931
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh yeah.

932
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

933
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So it just brings it down a little bit, but we still think this is going to be a really

934
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
powerful and compelling new key passive to play with once we go live.

935
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Two other changes here with the Flame Scar and Oculus uniques.

936
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
This is kind of adding in this chance to deal double damage affixes for Incinerate and Teleport

937
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
respectively.

938
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
This harkens back to what I talked about on the PTR stream where we're adding these multiplicative

939
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
damage bonuses into tempering for weapons.

940
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And of course we can't temper onto unique items, but for a lot of the unique items that

941
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
are about very specific skills such as Flame Scar and Oculus, we've taken a pass to add

942
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
in some of these affixes that enhance those skills in multiplicative ways to really make

943
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,000
sure that Incinerate gets the same benefit from using that unique as opposed to just a legendary

944
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
that you would temper this affix onto anyway.

945
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's a massive buff.

946
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Yes.

947
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Absolutely massive.

948
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Incinerate size is like, I had to pull out a ruler like, is it actually...

949
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah.

950
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Is it working?

951
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah.

952
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Incinerate size and Teleport size maybe not the most compelling affix.

953
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Now you just get some of this multiplicative damage.

954
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
If somebody wants to make an Oculus build where most of the damage comes from Teleport, that's

955
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
going to be awesome.

956
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
We'll see if you can manage to make that work.

957
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah, I love that idea.

958
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Oh my god.

959
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I already have a build page saved.

960
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Ooh.

961
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I'll have to see that.

962
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Nice.

963
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So yeah, once again, I just wanted to thank everyone for all the great feedback.

964
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
We on the class design team in particular are always reading and listening to feedback

965
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
on how you're playing the classes, what builds you're finding fun, what things are over or

966
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
underpowered.

967
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
We listen to it.

968
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
We read your feedback.

969
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
We watch the videos that you make.

970
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We really appreciate all of it.

971
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And it really helps us to make the game as best as possible.

972
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Awesome.

973
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Thank you so much, Charles, for walking us through all the changes coming for class design.

974
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
It's actually not all the changes that we saw right here.

975
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
As Charles mentioned, we do have patch notes actually going live after this stream.

976
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And I will caveat, you will see 2.0.1 patch notes and you'll see 2.0.2 patch notes.

977
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So there's 2.0.2 and 2.0.1.

978
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
2.0.2 is actually not on people's PCs yet.

979
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You haven't preloaded that.

980
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That is going to be the last update you'll need to grab before we jump into launch for Vessel

981
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
of Hatred.

982
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So you'll get all the patch notes after the stream so you can dig through all the class

983
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
changes that we didn't cover and all the ins and outs of it between now and what we have

984
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
for PTR.

985
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So last but not least, we have RuneWords.

986
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
So I think we're going to jump straight into it.

987
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So Anthony, you want to go ahead?

988
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah, absolutely.

989
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So again, awesome feedback.

990
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
We got lots of different things that came in.

991
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And we've heard multiple times a couple different things with the RuneWords that really just,

992
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
people kept repeating over and over again.

993
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Really, mostly stemming down to two major issues with the whole system.

994
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And so previously, on the PTR, we had the legendary runes that were a lot stronger because you

995
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
want to reach that point eventually to where you get the powerful runes and then you play

996
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
the game that way.

997
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Well, that was kind of outshining a lot of the other possibilities and like the idea that we had

998
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
with the runes where you're mixing and matching, creating different combinations.

999
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So what we are ending up doing now is we are taking that top end and we're going to bring it down.

1000
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And then on the flip side, the second thing that we heard a lot of is those bottom runes,

1001
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
those, I don't want to say bottom runes, the magic and rare runes that you find a little earlier,

1002
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
especially those runes of ritual where you are, those are the ones where you're actually like

1003
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,000
doing things to gain offering to then invoke those runes of invocation, those powers that you have.

1004
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Those were intentionally a bit lower so that you have some progress,

1005
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
but it felt like when you get them, it wasn't enough.

1006
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
You didn't get to really feel those runes happen and pop off when you get them.

1007
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So on the other side, we are taking that bottom end and bringing it up.

1008
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So together, we're kind of, I don't want to say flattening out, but we are making it a lot more

1009
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,000
options for the players to really have choices throughout your whole journey rather than just

1010
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
a linear, you know, get the stronger one. And then obviously it's stronger.

1011
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And what this will also do and the focus on this is to also make those utility runes really,

1012
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
really potent and really pop off and a lot more visual things to happen.

1013
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And then finally, we removed a couple of runes that weren't quite meeting our expectations.

1014
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
We have this thing that we say every once in a while, which is like condense the fun.

1015
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And we want to make that, you know, like the ideal situation where we have, you know,

1016
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
the runes that we have are the ones that are cool and fun and not like overbloated with just a

1017
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
bunch of things that don't, you know, don't always like meet those expectations.

1018
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yeah. We want you to have lots of options and we don't want individual runes or effects to really

1019
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
overshadow everything else. But that does mean that, you know, we want to make sure that all the

1020
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
options are really compelling. And so ones that aren't meeting our bar, we just would rather take

1021
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
them out rather than leave them in.

1022
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah.

1023
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah.

1024
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Absolutely.

1025
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I think we're always going to be adding to the rune system.

1026
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Of course.

1027
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So we want to leave ourselves the space. We didn't want to water down the pool with things

1028
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
like the lightning bolt effect rune. It's like that didn't really have, it was an evolutionary

1029
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
dead end. We didn't necessarily have any way to juice that up. So we want one of rune drops

1030
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
for it to feel like, oh, there's this new toy I can play with. Right.

1031
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It's important that every choice in the rune system is meaningful. Like every, every possible

1032
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
rune you can take or combination, like there's something there. Right.

1033
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah. You want to feel it for sure. And it doesn't want to be something that, you know,

1034
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
you just like, oh, I got this rune. And it's like, well, let me find another one.

1035
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:01,000
All right. So here's some examples of some of the big outliers. We heard lots, lots of

1036
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
feedback around these two, especially that war cry rune. So while it was giving berserking

1037
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
to everyone, it was a big power bonus. And so we're going to bring that down a little

1038
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,000
bit by just, it's no longer going to give that, that enhanced version. It's just the

1039
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
baseline version. So it no longer gives berserking to all players. That does mean it still works

1040
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
for barbarians because that is their skill. They should still be able to gain that power

1041
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
as they would expect. And then down with the, the yam, which is that druid petrify,

1042
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
the rune itself is not changing. What's actually changing is on druids themselves,

1043
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
their ultimate there is no longer going to give that critical bonus baseline. It's not going to be

1044
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
the enhanced version. So if you want that as a druid, you can still get that big, powerful,

1045
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,000
critical damage bonus. But now that baseline is going to be that big stun, that big AOE moment that

1046
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,000
you see everything on the screen freeze and also just juice you up with a bunch of resource. And

1047
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
this is general, like class resource. So unlike what it'll say for the druid is it says their spirit

1048
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:12,000
goes up. On the rune, it says it is your resource. So everyone gets this huge, big moment where you

1049
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
can kind of reset. So if I'm a sorcerer, it doesn't generate spirit, it generates mana. Yes. You don't

1050
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:27,000
just get a second bubble that fills up the spirit. That'd be weird. I like that this puts a lot more

1051
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
emphasis on the utility of runes, which is sort of what we had been originally intending, right? Not

1052
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
every choice is going to be a multiplicative damage source. So you should have a lot more options.

1053
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
It's more focused on utility. Yeah, absolutely. And stealing other classes' power. Yeah, obviously,

1054
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
multiplicative damage is probably the single strongest thing you can do in an ARPG. And

1055
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
just when we noticed these ones were really those ones that are overshadowing every other

1056
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
option, we still think those will find a great niche for the builds that want it, but they

1057
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
won't be the only choice that no one else can use anything else for. Yeah, absolutely.

1058
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:06,000
All right. So here's some examples. Again, I want to preface, this is not all of them.

1059
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
There are a bunch of changes. You guys will see them in the patch notes as we had already

1060
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
talked about. But some of the big ones that I wanted to show off here. So Spiritborn Vortex,

1061
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
that's the one that pulls everyone in, you group everything together, that is going to be

1062
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,000
almost, you're going to be able to get that almost twice as often as it was before. So

1063
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
you combine that in with something that, you know, has some grindy damage in the middle, and

1064
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:39,000
you're going to be just having this pop off all the time. As well as, so we call them subpowers.

1065
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Those are things like the sorcerer meteorites, or like the barbarian earthquakes, those things

1066
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
that happen based on other things, but they create like another power that comes out. We are juicing

1067
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,000
those up a lot more. So these should be some of the most powerful versions of these subpowers

1068
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
in the game from these runes. And as you can see here, meteorites is jumping up a whole bunch,

1069
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
as well as the offering cost is going down. So you're going to be able to summon a lot more

1070
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
of these as well. And then one of the other things I saw feedback was around the say rune. I don't know exactly how to say it myself. I'll have to ask you a minute about that after this.

1071
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:41,000
But where you summon spirit wolves, and they didn't feel as impactful because their AI was not as poppy as like say the Necromancers minions running around a lot more quickly. So we adjusted that, and so we're going to have a video coming up here in a second.

1072
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And we can see, so now you're going to summon those wolves, they're going to pop up and do their attack. And if you jump to the next pack, they're going to jump forward.

1073
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Except this is going to happen a lot more frequently than before. So now if you say fight that pack, jump to the next one, every time those wolves are going to just keep jumping and keep leaping.

1074
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And this works in ranged as well. So if you're fighting some enemy over here to the left, and you attack them, your wolves are going to jump immediately over there. And then if you switch to this other group on the right, those wolves are going to jump across the screen because we've also increased that aggro range as well for that.

1075
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Yeah, they feel a lot more responsive. And like, even in that clip, we saw them jump into the pack at basically the same time we did, right? They are right there with you. They're not lagging behind.

1076
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And that's always like the worst feeling when you're like, hey, some of this thing, where are they? What are they doing?

1077
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
They're like, they're like, they're no longer lazy dogs.

1078
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Yeah, yeah, they were tired. They were tired.

1079
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Tired little pups, you know?

1080
01:00:45,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And then here are some examples of those runes of ritual. Again, those are the ones that are generating this offering. And so these are mostly going to be changes to those magic and rare runes, where we've taken that offering they give, and we've really knocked it up to be a lot closer to where those legendary versions of these are. And that should hopefully give us a lot more options when it comes to deciding which combination of which runes that we are using.

1081
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It also just means things are a lot more reliable. Like you're actually getting procs way more often with these buffs.

1082
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, you actually get to see the fun happen, right? See those effects happen a little bit more often.

1083
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah, so tons of rune changes that are coming. And as Anthony mentioned, there's way more details in the actual patch notes themselves. So people can check that out after the stream, along with all the class changes, the system changes, the progression changes.

1084
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
It's all detailed out there for players specifically.

1085
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know, I had one thing, because I think we might have forgotten it. And, you know, I'm very concerned about monitor violence.

1086
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Oh, yes.

1087
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We heard a lot of people who wanted to punch and punch monitors.

1088
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh, that's right. Yes.

1089
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
When you get a greater affects on impairment resistance.

1090
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Oh, yeah.

1091
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
As monitor enthusiasts, we've just removed that from the affects pool.

1092
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yes.

1093
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So, please don't.

1094
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Please don't.

1095
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Less punching of monitors.

1096
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Save the monitors, please.

1097
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And one thing I do want to call out on RuneWords. We actually, funny enough, we got a lot of feedback about players saying like, hey, we noticed like different art on some of the classic runes that they may have seen from like back in D2.

1098
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
That art has been updated to match what you saw in D2.

1099
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
So, Harkins back.

1100
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Yes.

1101
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
That's cool.

1102
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Yeah.

1103
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Shout out to the history of runes there for everyone.

1104
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So, thank you guys for jumping into this.

1105
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And I will say like this team is going to be staying vigilant through the launch of Vessel of Hatred with our LiveOps teams here.

1106
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Shout out to our LiveOps team who will be helping us out through multitudes of patches, hot fixes.

1107
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,000
We're going to be paying attention to the community and hearing all the feedback that players have.

1108
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And we'll be jumping on a lot of the big things that we do notice and we do want to jump like kind of address earlier on, especially right after launch.

1109
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So, our cadence is going to be quick.

1110
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So, do expect that.

1111
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
We'll be posting all notes, all hotfix notes, etc.

1112
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Whenever they do come up.

1113
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So, thank you guys again for joining us today to talk about the PTR learnings.

1114
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Next up, we actually are going to start talking about the next season coming to Diablo 4, which is season six.

1115
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And that will actually start with the launch of Vessel of Hatred.

1116
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
We're going to do another quick mic swap musical chairs thing.

1117
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Maybe we turn on Benny Hill music or something like that.

1118
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
But we'll be right back here with our next group to talk about season six.

1119
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
From technology.

1120
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Asiana Beach Hills.

1121
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000

01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Let's go catch them over the next week.

1126
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
They'll be right back in the northeast.

Thank you.

1137
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Thank you.

1138
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Thank you.

1139
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Thank you.

1140
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Thank you.

1141
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Thank you.

1142
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
All right, we're back.

1143
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Sorry for that.

1144
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I'm glad you guys got to watch Dancing Demons and everything like that and see our release

1145
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
date map.

1146
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
But we're back here to talk about Season 6.

1147
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
This is the new season coming with the launch of Vessel of Hatred and I'm joined by this

1148
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
wonderful group here, Brent, who we already know, our game director here.

1149
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
But Tim, Don, do you want to introduce yourselves?

1150
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Yes.

1151
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
My name is Tim Ismay.

1152
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
I am one of the lead producers on Diablo 4.

1153
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I mostly work on seasons.

1154
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm Don Adams.

1155
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I'm Don Adams.

1156
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I'm the lead season designer for Season 6, the season of Hatred Rising.

1157
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Also known as Content Supervisor.

1158
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Also known as Content Supervisor.

1159
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
There we go.

1160
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Awesome.

1161
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So, as Don just mentioned here, Season 6 is Season of Hatred Rising.

1162
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Tim, do you want to explain to us what Hatred Rising or Brent?

1163
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Yeah, I'll take this one.

1164
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
So, when we started off with this, we really knew we wanted to make sure that we were launching

1165
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
a brand new season right alongside Vessel of Hatred.

1166
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
We wanted that to be day and date.

1167
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So, like, continuity was really important to us.

1168
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And so, the idea that the hatred of Mephisto and Nahantu is spilling out into the rest of

1169
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Sanctuary was kind of the anchor that we were holding on to.

1170
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And we started talking about what that would mean to make a whole season around that.

1171
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Awesome.

1172
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And I know with kind of, like, what players hearing Hatred Rising, they're hearing about,

1173
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
you know, Mephisto and his hatred potentially leaking out into Nahantu, maybe the rest of Sanctuary.

1174
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Like, what can players expect with this actual season?

1175
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Yeah, so a lot of actually what is going to be the core of Season 6 and the Season 6 experience,

1176
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
players have already gotten exposed to.

1177
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So, anybody who's playing on the PTR has been reading about the changes we put up there.

1178
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Fundamental to the release of Vessel of Hatred, Season 6 brings big changes where every single

1179
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
class is going to gain access to new skill points.

1180
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
They're going to gain new skills across all the classes.

1181
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
They're going to gain more Paragon points, new Legendary Paragon glyphs.

1182
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
These are all changes that are being added to the base of the game, meaning you do not

1183
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
need to have Vessel of Hatred to gain access to these.

1184
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
You also will still have access to these after Season 6.

1185
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
These are permanent changes to the game.

1186
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
On top of that, we got the standard new Legendary aspects.

1187
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
We have new unique items and new Mythic items.

1188
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Crazy powerful Mythic items that are going to unlock just new levels of power that were

1189
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
not possible before in the game.

1190
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Now, to go along with this power, we will be adding these new difficulty levels that again

1191
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
we saw on PTR.

1192
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So, you have the ability to challenge these new levels of power.

1193
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I want to say that it's all going to even out well.

1194
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Honestly, despite the tireless efforts of our designers, just constant trying to get that

1195
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,000
balance just right based on all the feedback that comes in, I know that maybe it'll be

1196
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
out for a day before someone's posting a video and saying, oh, look at this, I do a trillion

1197
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,000
damage.

1198
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And it'll go all over the internet.

1199
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Like, I've never seen numbers this big.

1200
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
That's, yeah.

1201
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
But we tried.

1202
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
We tried to get it there.

1203
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You're going to see crazy builds.

1204
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Those are going to link into new difficulties that were never there before to try in all

1205
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:36,000
this new content.

1206
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Yeah, awesome.

1207
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Yeah, I know all these things that players got to experience a little bit in PTR.

1208
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,000
They got to see it.

1209
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
They got to check it out early.

1210
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
But, of course, there is more kind of associated with this specific season.

1211
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
So, Don, do you want to talk a little bit more about what players can also see beyond

1212
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
what Tim kind of walked through?

1213
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1214
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So, you know, as we mentioned, this is the season of hatred rising.

1215
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
So we really wanted to theme it around Mephisto's hatred creeping out of Nihantu and into the

1216
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
rest of the world.

1217
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
So let's go ahead and take a look at our visual aid here.

1218
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Beautiful.

1219
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Amazing.

1220
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I was promised.

1221
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Official documents.

1222
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I was promised that this would be turned into real art when I sent this over.

1223
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I didn't think we'd be showing this.

1224
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
But hopefully this will all make sense by the end of the presentation.

1225
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Just for now, just take it in.

1226
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,000
There you go.

1227
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Yeah.

1228
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Everyone loves designer art.

1229
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's core to all our live streams that we do.

1230
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Art by Don Adams here.

1231
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Yeah.

1232
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And frankly, I think it speaks for itself.

1233
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I don't really know if there's much more to say.

1234
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
But let's go ahead and go ahead and do the next slide here.

1235
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And let's take a look at some real art to get you ready for the season here.

1236
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
This is, of course, amazing key art from Dave Raposa.

1237
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I just love kicking that demon in the face.

1238
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
That makes me happy every time I see it.

1239
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Let's go ahead and move on to the next slide.

1240
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And I'll get into some actual details about how this stuff shows up in the world,

1241
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
what you're going to be looking for when you're hunting these guys down.

1242
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
So you're going to see these hatred rising zone events that cycle frequently throughout the world.

1243
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
When these are up, everything in that area is going to be corrupted by hatred.

1244
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
You're going to be seeing environmental changes, lighting changes.

1245
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
The monsters will actually have, you know, kind of hatred gummy goop on them.

1246
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
You can be ambushed from portals randomly.

1247
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And really all this is just setting the stage for the Realm Walker.

1248
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So you'll have a separate event icon that will let you know when the Realm Walker is going to be up.

1249
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
It's a world event, so it will be in that list on the map with, you know,

1250
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
other, like, world bosses and Legion events and stuff.

1251
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And we have some video here to kind of show you what it looks like.

1252
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Oh, actually, I think we have another slide about the Realm Walker first.

1253
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Sorry.

1254
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Yeah, so this is what he looks like in-game.

1255
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
He's awesome.

1256
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
These are just big, hulking kind of monstrosities stomping around, you know,

1257
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
just spreading Mephisto's hatred.

1258
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
They summon in monsters from a plane of hell through this portal on their back.

1259
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
And a lot of the monsters they summon, most of them are actually new monsters from Vessel of Hatred.

1260
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
They're the Hollows family, which are super cool and gross.

1261
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
So I think now we can take a look at what it actually looks like in-game.

1262
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
So here's some players waiting for him to spawn.

1263
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:31,000
He starts Burrowed like that, and you can kind of click the portal to summon some stuff to fight while you're getting warmed up here.

1264
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I just love these enemies.

1265
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
They're so cool, the Hollows.

1266
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So he busts out of the ground.

1267
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:47,000
And this is actually, we want to do something new with this event and lean into the fantasy of this giant thing just like stomping around.

1268
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So it's actually a walking world event.

1269
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
He has several different paths you can take throughout each area.

1270
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
He walks through the zone.

1271
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
And as he walks, he just leaves this, you know, chaos behind him in his wake.

1272
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
He's summoning tons of Hollows.

1273
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And, you know, if you get in front of him, he just punts you out of the way and keeps going.

1274
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
You actually can't even damage him directly in this phase.

1275
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:11,000
But if you kill enough of the adds that he's spawning, it'll create these bloodbound guardians.

1276
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Killing these will shave some of the HP off of the Realm Walker.

1277
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,000
So when he reaches the end of his path and you can actually fight him, you'll have, you know, less HP to burn through.

1278
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
So this is a nice way to incentivize actually, you know, participating, sticking around for all this chaos.

1279
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Obviously lots of XP and whatnot from the mobs as well.

1280
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:37,000
So this is the event that he kicks off when he actually gets to his destination.

1281
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
When you interrupt this ritual by destroying all of these destructible hatred spires,

1282
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
that's when you'll actually be able to fight him directly.

1283
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And I think we're going to see that here very quickly.

1284
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
This is a really cool encounter.

1285
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
There's just lots of, you know, he has a big smashy attack.

1286
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
He sprays a lot of damage everywhere.

1287
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Okay, so they've taken him down.

1288
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And when he dies, that weird portal on his back drops down and stays open.

1289
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And there's only really one thing to do with a weird portal.

1290
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yeah, you go in the portal.

1291
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
It's your option.

1292
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
So that's what portals are made for.

1293
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Successfully killing the Realm Walker, taking down this massive demon,

1294
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
finally grants you your reward of more demons.

1295
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
So you're going to go into the Seething Realm.

1296
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
This is part of the Mephisto's area of hell.

1297
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
So you are going to have to continue fighting in here.

1298
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It is not a barren landscape.

1299
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
But the demons you fight in here, comparatively,

1300
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
if you were strong enough to take down a Realm Walker, don't be too worried.

1301
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I think you're going to be able to manage the demons inside of the Seething Realm as well.

1302
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
This dungeon is a little bit more of a reward dungeon.

1303
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:49,000
So once you get in here, you're fighting your way through to get specific buffs at the end of it.

1304
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
So if we want, we can jump into the video here.

1305
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah, this is the first section.

1306
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And this part, you're just kind of mowing through some of these smaller guys.

1307
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
You're really just looking for a specific gate here.

1308
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
There's a portal that you're going to be activating and making an important choice there

1309
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
about which section of the Seething Realm you go into.

1310
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Here it is.

1311
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
This is the gate here.

1312
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
So you're going to click on this.

1313
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
You now have options.

1314
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Based on a few consumables that you can put in,

1315
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
you can go into sections that are more focused on equipment bonus, gold bonus.

1316
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
You can get a socketable bonus.

1317
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
You can get more endgame items with like compasses and boss materials.

1318
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
So you're going to pick one of these and decide that's the section I want to go into.

1319
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
You're going to get some drops similar to that in this section of the dungeon.

1320
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
But more importantly, this is going to set you up for the type of buff you want to get at the end of the dungeon.

1321
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
So again, this is not an empty area.

1322
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
You are going to have to fight through it.

1323
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
You're going to encounter more hollows in here, some more elites.

1324
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
All of this leading up to a chest at the end.

1325
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Here is your reward.

1326
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
So finally, you just click on this.

1327
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,000
You get your reward.

1328
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Ah, just kidding.

1329
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah, of course it's a curse event.

1330
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Of course.

1331
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You're going to have to fight even more demons.

1332
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Nothing's free in hell.

1333
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
This is just how you got to do it.

1334
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
So you fight your way through some more elites.

1335
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,000
But don't worry.

1336
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I believe in you.

1337
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
You can get through this.

1338
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
If you kill the last guy.

1339
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
There's one more there.

1340
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Take him down.

1341
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Come on.

1342
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
All right.

1343
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
So he goes down.

1344
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Now you get your prizes.

1345
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You're going to open these chests.

1346
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
There's a variety of loot that you get.

1347
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
But one specific item that you're looking for in here.

1348
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Which is going to be a seething opal.

1349
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,000
So these little.

1350
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
There they are.

1351
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Yeah, little seething opals.

1352
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
They got a little seasonal marker on them.

1353
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
This is special to season six.

1354
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
When you get these.

1355
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I'm going to take a look here.

1356
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
This is going to be a buff you get.

1357
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Based on the one that you chose.

1358
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
There are some fundamentals you always get.

1359
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So a seething opal always gives you a 15% bonus to experience.

1360
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
This is especially cool because it stacks with elixirs.

1361
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
You can have an elixir and a seething opal active at the same time.

1362
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
That's a huge bonus.

1363
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
On top of that.

1364
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Any seething opal that you use is going to allow you to now get reputation with the remnants of the Zaku room.

1365
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Don will talk about that more in just a second.

1366
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
But that's going to be the reputation track for season six.

1367
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And then beyond that you will get a bonus depending on which portal you went through.

1368
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Which section of the Seething Realm you decided to go into.

1369
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Here we go.

1370
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Yeah, if you want to snapshot this.

1371
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Anybody who's screenshotting.

1372
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
These are some of the bonuses you can get.

1373
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
As you can see on here you're getting maybe more items.

1374
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Maybe more gold.

1375
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
More socketables.

1376
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
So these bonuses are going to occur while fighting anything while having this buff active.

1377
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
So equipment as an example.

1378
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Maybe I wanted more items to be dropping.

1379
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
When you kill monsters there's a chance that they're going to drop a cache.

1380
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
That is going to give you some additional loot.

1381
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And if you're playing content in let's say further in the end game.

1382
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
That monsters don't traditionally drop loot.

1383
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Not to worry.

1384
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
We've adjusted that as well.

1385
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
If you play through the pit as an example.

1386
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
We have added an additional drop at the end of the pit.

1387
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Again that procs based on which Seething Opal that you chose.

1388
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
There are a couple up here at the end.

1389
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Oh the socketable one I should mention.

1390
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
That one is special too.

1391
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
You do have to have Vessel of Hatred for that one.

1392
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
This one is more for people that are trying to get more runes.

1393
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So obviously you need to have Vessel of Hatred to get runes.

1394
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
So that's what's going to make this valuable to you.

1395
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
It's cool to also see like boss summoning items on here.

1396
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Infernal Compasses as well.

1397
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Infernal Compasses themselves are going to be very valuable.

1398
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Because it's as Colin was mentioning before.

1399
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,000
We saw what you can end up getting in Infernal Hordes and everything like that.

1400
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
It's just another opportunity to get more compasses for getting in there.

1401
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Yeah Seething Opal of Tormant I think is great.

1402
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I think that grape flavored opal is going to be very popular.

1403
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
The grape one is going to be pretty popular.

1404
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And a question I just quickly solved.

1405
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Because you mentioned stacking with Elixirs.

1406
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Does it also stack with Incense?

1407
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Yeah it will stack with Incense.

1408
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,000
There you go.

1409
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So that's a triple stack of XP right there.

1410
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
You get a lot of experience.

1411
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Which is actually really cool.

1412
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So that's awesome.

1413
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So obviously like you know we're seeing the rewards here.

1414
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And one thing that you had mentioned which was the Zack Room remnants.

1415
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Like what Don can you like talk to us a little bit.

1416
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
About kind of what that progression track is going to be.

1417
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Yeah sure.

1418
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
So these are the Zack Room remnants.

1419
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
You've probably seen these guys in Hawazar.

1420
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
These are the Crusaders with the rusty armor.

1421
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
That have just been kind of bombing around.

1422
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Since they you know they failed to find Akarat's tomb.

1423
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
They have a very personal connection with Mephisto.

1424
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,000
You know he of course destroyed basically the Zack Room order many years ago.

1425
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And at this time they're still just not really ready to stand up.

1426
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
And fight this at full force right.

1427
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
They've been dealing with cultists.

1428
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
And they're just not at their full strength.

1429
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
So you'll meet this Crusader right at the start of the season.

1430
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Who will give you a very simple intro quest basically.

1431
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
To guide you to kill a Realmwalker.

1432
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Clear a seething realm.

1433
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And he'll be your point of contact for reputation rewards following that.

1434
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,000
So you know basically we built this in a way that.

1435
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
With the Opals giving rep for all sorts of different activities.

1436
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
The idea is that you can you know go and kind of do whatever you want to do.

1437
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
As long as you're checking in periodically with the Realmwalker.

1438
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
And keeping a stack of these Opals on hand.

1439
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
It's very open ended how you want to push this reputation track.

1440
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Yeah it is always nice to see that.

1441
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Anywhere that new demons occur in the world.

1442
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
There is always some faction out there that's trying to take care of them.

1443
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And would appreciate your help.

1444
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
So the Zoccero here they've had a rough go of it.

1445
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
But if you can help them out I think that we can handle this problem.

1446
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
And they're not at their best right now.

1447
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Yeah.

1448
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
You know one of the things that I really like about the way we've looked at this whole package.

1449
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Is that not only have we done a bunch of diligence in making sure that the story is taking part in all of Sanctuary.

1450
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:44,000
We're touching on some really cool lore stuff that has existed for a long period of time.

1451
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
But we're also leaning into a theme of giving the players more control over the experience.

1452
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And so whether it's the choice of reward or being able to stack these rewards to get specific outcomes.

1453
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
You're going to see that not only in the season.

1454
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
So everybody's going to get access to this in the season.

1455
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,000
But we have that theme also creeping into some of the stuff you'll see with the Vessel of Hatred content in just a few minutes.

1456
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Yeah.

1457
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Yeah.

1458
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
So hopefully the hieroglyphs that we saw at the beginning.

1459
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:13,000
The designer.

1460
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Hopefully this makes sense now.

1461
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
You kill the Realm Walker to get the portal.

1462
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
You do the portal to get the opals.

1463
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
And then you go do the MS Paint sort of shapes of all the other activities that are in the game.

1464
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
You can also just chain run the Realm Walker if you'd like as well.

1465
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
He's up very often.

1466
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
And I expect people will kind of go back and forth on how often they're interacting with them.

1467
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
You might want to stack a bunch of opals for the weekend or something.

1468
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
If you hate Realm Walkers and you're like, I just want to kill Realm Walkers all day, you can.

1469
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
What I love about the season is exactly that.

1470
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,000
You can get the opal.

1471
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It's a great buff.

1472
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And now go play other content, including the new content that's coming out in Vessel of Hatred if you bought the expansion.

1473
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Got a lot of options there.

1474
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
So you don't have to just play the seasonal content.

1475
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
You'll play this other stuff while still having the buff.

1476
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Including the Vessel of Hatred campaign, which is kind of a first, right?

1477
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
You'll need to have completed the base campaign.

1478
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
But you can play the Vessel of Hatred campaign alongside the Season 6 content, which is pretty cool.

1479
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Yeah, so huge for people that have base game or Vessel of Hatred can partake in the content for this season.

1480
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Don, Tim, thank you guys for walking us through all the Season of Hatred Rising content that's coming with the launch of Vessel of Hatred.

1481
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:30,000
This is starting right at the beginning, right when Vessel of Hatred actually comes out, which is on, again, October 7th at 4 p.m.

1482
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
For some people.

1483
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
4 p.m. Pacific time, which is for everyone because it is one global release.

1484
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
It'll be the 7th for me.

1485
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Yeah, 7th for us here in California.

1486
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
But for other people, if you follow time zones, that's what it'll end up being.

1487
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
So we'll see Tim Moore during our Q&A at the end.

1488
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
But we are actually going to jump into some of the Vessel of Hatred features next.

1489
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
We're going to do another musical chair as Benny Hill style.

1490
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Swap out some mics and everything.

1491
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
But we have a lot to talk about.

1492
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
We got Spiritborn stuff to talk about.

1493
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
We got Cur-Ass Undercity.

1494
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Or Cur-Ass Undercity to talk about.

1495
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Well, I've been doing that quite often this week.

1496
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Dark Citadel and, of course, Mercenary.

1497
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
So we'll be back with a whole new crew here in just a couple minutes.

1498
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Let's go.

1499
01:24:43,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Let's go.

1500
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Let's go.

1501
01:25:43,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Let's go.

1502
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Let's go.

1503
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Let's go.

1504
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Let's go.

1505
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Let's go.

1506
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Let's go.

1507
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Let's go.

1508
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Let's go.

1509
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Let's go.

1510
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Let's go.

1511
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Let's go.

1512
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Let's go.

1513
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Let's go.

1514
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Let's go.

1515
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Let's go.

1516
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Let's go.

1517
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Let's go.

1518
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Let's go.

1519
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Let's go.

1520
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Let's go.

1521
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Let's go.

1522
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Let's go.

1523
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Let's go.

1524
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Let's go.

1525
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Let's go.

1526
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Let's go.

1527
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Let's go.

1528
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Let's go.

1529
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Let's go.

1530
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:43,000
To be continued...

1531
01:28:43,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Thank you.

1532
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Thank you.

1533
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Thank you.

1534
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Thank you.

1535
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Thank you.

1536
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Thank you.

1537
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Thank you.

1538
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Thank you.

1539
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Thank you.

1540
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Thank you.

1541
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Thank you.

1542
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Thank you.

1543
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Thank you.

1544
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Season Designer, and I'll be chatting about the Kuros Underseeding in a few.

1545
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Bjorn? Bjorn Mikkelsen, Class Designer

1546
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
for Spirit Porn. Hi, I'm Dan Brace. I'm a Lead Game Designer, and I'll

1547
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
be talking about Mercenaries. Awesome. Cool. So, you know, tons

1548
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,000
of content coming to Vessel of Hatred. I know

1549
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
players have heard us talk about it a little bit, but Brent,

1550
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,000
did you want to talk about any content specifically before we jump in?

1551
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Yeah, I mean, just kind of teeing up the next big thing that we want to talk

1552
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
about is just kind of how well the Spirit Born reaction has been since we've

1553
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
announced it. It's been amazing to see folks so

1554
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
excited about it. It's something that we've been pouring a lot of love into. We wanted to

1555
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
make sure they were adding something fresh to the game, and I really feel like we're there.

1556
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
But, when we released it, we actually still had work to do.

1557
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
And so, throughout the PTR

1558
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,000
and the last few weeks of development

1559
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
here, we've been putting a lot of effort into polishing

1560
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
things up, and I'm super excited

1561
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
to hear Bjorn talk about what we've got in store.

1562
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Yeah, lots of internal testing. We have players

1563
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
actually check it out at Gamescom

1564
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
as well, which was really cool. So,

1565
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
as we all know, Bjorn

1566
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
was on our Spirit Born reveal

1567
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
stream, and he's back to talk

1568
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
more about Spirit Born. So, here

1569
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
is Spirit Bjorn

1570
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
to talk more about the Spirit Born.

1571
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
It's hard for me to actually say Spirit

1572
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Born now, because I just say Spirit Bjorn. So, there we go.

1573
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Awesome. Yeah. Yes, I mean, we've seen a lot of the sort of in development side of it, and we're just going to talk about a few kind of final touches, the final version of a few things that we want to hit on quickly here in this presentation.

1574
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
So, starting off, we're going to talk about a couple of updates to the Spirit Born's passives.

1575
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
First off, we have three additional passives which have been added to the tree.

1576
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Each of these kind of amplifies how the skills work that they relate to. So, we have one for core skills, one for potency skills, and one for focus skills.

1577
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And that sort of lets you kind of go more all-in on any of those skills.

1578
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:45,000
There's also here on the far side of the slide an update to Noxious Resonance, which is one of Spirit Born's key passives.

1579
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:54,000
We really wanted to kind of clarify how this mechanic works, how it scales, and kind of answer some lingering questions about exactly how it works.

1580
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
But it's still largely based around exploding the poisons on your enemies.

1581
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Moving on to another thing, we're going to have a small update to the Jaguar primary Spirit Hall.

1582
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:11,000
This will still do lots of damage whenever you spec into it. It's all about damage with the Jaguar.

1583
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:20,000
But this has focused it a little bit more about multi-attack skills, high attack speed, and really allowing you to ramp up the damage that you can get it.

1584
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Because now it's also based around the damage that you did in a short window.

1585
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
So, that lets you sort of echo all of that damage that you did the faster you're attacking.

1586
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Moving on to another small, or sort of medium-sized update.

1587
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:40,000
There was some confusion around Spirit Feathers, Storm Feathers, the Eagle Hall, how all that kind of works together.

1588
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
So, this has been unified into a new concept just called Storm Feathers.

1589
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
What this is, is this is a buff that you can get. This increases your movement speed, and it stacks duration.

1590
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And now all of these things, they all speak to the Storm Feather concept.

1591
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
So, you can get them, you can modify them, you can make them do different things.

1592
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And you can even use it to make kind of some crazy builds.

1593
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I think we have a video for it, where you can just kind of have feathers going all over the place as you're doing it.

1594
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And you can even use like tempering and various paragon that increases Storm Feather potency.

1595
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
That will speak to all of these aspects, as well as the Eagle Primary Hall.

1596
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And then, moving on to the last thing we've got, should be our Uniques.

1597
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
So, some of you might have gotten to see some early versions of these.

1598
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
But we want to kind of show off the final versions with all of their stats and all of their glory.

1599
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
So, to start off, we have six unique Spirit-Born Rings.

1600
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Each of these kind of emphasizes a combination of two Spirits.

1601
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
And really lets you sort of tailor how you generate your resource.

1602
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
To sort of make the build that you're looking to make.

1603
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Then, moving on to our Unique Armors.

1604
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
We showed off the Scorn of the Earth Boots that turns your Soarin' to Evade.

1605
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And everybody really loved that.

1606
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
A couple other examples.

1607
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:04,000
We've got Craze of the Dead God, which allows you to turn all damage coming at you into poisoning damage.

1608
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
And then sort of throw that back out at your enemies in the form of Touch of Death.

1609
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Which is pretty neat.

1610
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
And then we've also got our Helms.

1611
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
We have two different Unique Helms.

1612
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,000
One is focused more along the lines of letting you sort of mix and match Spirits.

1613
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
While the other one is more about kind of doubling down on using a single Spirit.

1614
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
And then finally, we have our Unique Weapons.

1615
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
We've got several Glaives and Quarterstaffs.

1616
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
We already showed off the basic one.

1617
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
But we're going to quickly show off sort of its counterpart, which is the one for your Core Skills.

1618
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:42,000
So this one allows you to sort of spam your Core Skills almost as if they were basics.

1619
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
That sort of reduced damage.

1620
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:51,000
But when you're at maximum vigor, it ramps up to be a maximum size, guaranteed crit, just massive screen clearing version of the Core Skill.

1621
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
So we think that one's pretty fun too.

1622
01:35:53,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And then lastly, I believe I have a slide just for, yeah, there we go, our drop tables for the bosses.

1623
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,000
So if you're looking to target farm any of these specific ones similar to the other classes, you can kind of farm these based on different bosses.

1624
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So take a screenshot of this and go for it.

1625
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Awesome.

1626
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Yeah, tons of updates.

1627
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I mean, we've done so much internal testing.

1628
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
We've heard a lot of feedback because we have that deep dive blog.

1629
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
We've seen people theory craft.

1630
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
We've seen people actually play it at Gamescom.

1631
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
We've had a couple of content creators like during the Spirit Porn live stream.

1632
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
And even during our like kind of a preview event, they actually got to try it out and stuff.

1633
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:40,000
So hearing all this feedback and then, you know, applying some of the feedback and some of the internal feedback that we ended up getting and seeing all the changes here and updating everyone has been really cool to see.

1634
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
So thank you again, Bjorn, for walking us through the Spirit Porn.

1635
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
The class is incredibly fun.

1636
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Day one is what I'm planning for Vessel of Hadrian.

1637
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I think most of us are.

1638
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
But yeah, it's a ton of fun to check out.

1639
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Next up, what we wanted to talk about is Cure Asunder City.

1640
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,000
This is actually a feature that we did announce with Gamescom.

1641
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:11,000
But we didn't really get a ton of opportunities to really kind of like dive deeper into what Cure Asunder City is.

1642
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
So Derek, you want to take us through this?

1643
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1644
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So the Cure Asunder City is a brand new dungeon experience that players, our Vessel of Hatred players, will be unlocking throughout the course of the campaign.

1645
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:32,000
It's appropriately located in the new capital city of Cure Ast, but it's the part of town that's not recommended that the standard citizen will venture into.

1646
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:41,000
It's a section of the Kuros town that is still infested by the jungles of Nahantu and kind of overrun with the worst of the worst.

1647
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
It's Nahantu's most wanted inside the various districts that make up the Undercity.

1648
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Throughout the course, as players are unlocking it, they'll meet a new character named C-Heck that kind of teaches you the laws of the Undercity and how to commune with the Spirit Flames to traverse its treacherous depths, basically.

1649
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:06,000
So that's kind of like the narrative setting for it, but let's dive into the actual experiential standpoint, which we see here already.

1650
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:24,000
So the Cure Asunder City is an intense multi-floor time attack dungeon where players will be racing against an aggressive countdown timer to reach the district boss with as high of a rewards upgrade meter built up as possible and try not to let that timer expire.

1651
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:33,000
So fun little novel wrinkle here is that killing certain monsters we refer to as afflicted will give you time bonuses to extend your time in the Undercity.

1652
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:43,000
And just killing monsters in general and completing dungeon activities will build up this reward upgrade meter referred to in-game as attunement.

1653
01:38:43,000 --> 01:39:01,000
As far as the Undercity's role, it's one novel, new novel leveling content, but its power really comes into the fact that it's brand new opportunistic content that allows players to make very efficient, very specific progress towards rewards goals as the opportunities arise.

1654
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I'll dive deeper into that in the next few slides, but for now, just want to kind of set the stage that the Undercity does not necessarily have any objective aside from get to the boss, beat the clock, and do so with the highest amount of rewards upgrades built up as possible.

1655
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:26,000
How the players go about doing that is entirely up to them because this is a dungeon that celebrates autonomy, flow, and variety.

1656
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
This is a good example we were talking about earlier when we're looking at the new modes that we have.

1657
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
We want that player agency to come back to the player.

1658
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Play your way.

1659
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
And I think this is a perfect example of that.

1660
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1661
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
So let's dive into the next slide here.

1662
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Cool.

1663
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:51,000
So I mentioned opportunistic content, and this is where the Undercity's primary role in the reward structure is.

1664
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
So we have dungeon keys that grant you access to dungeons.

1665
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
The Undercity's version of a dungeon key is in the form of tributes.

1666
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,000
So you can hop into an Undercity run without a tribute, just do the thing, the base run.

1667
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:15,000
But when you start applying tributes, this is where we allow you to define the specific reward upgrade opportunities of your next Undercity run at the cost of increasing the runs challenge.

1668
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
So you can see an example of a tribute here.

1669
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
This is the Tribute of Radiance.

1670
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And when you slot this in, so long as you complete your Undercity run with at least Attunement Rank 1, we will guarantee that you get Ancestral Legendaries at the end.

1671
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
We'll dive a little bit deeper into some of the nuances.

1672
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
You can see that it has dungeon affixes that define the specific challenge.

1673
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So the higher and more powerful the tribute, the tougher the challenge is in the form of lower starting time, time bonus penalties, and potion drop penalties.

1674
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
But the fun doesn't really stop there.

1675
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
In fact, we're just getting started.

1676
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Once you apply a tribute, you now unlock the ability to define a bargain.

1677
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Each tribute has a list of bargains mapped to it.

1678
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
So this Tribute of Radiance has a collection of them.

1679
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
We're just picking out a couple that seem pretty fun to show off.

1680
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:12,000
And bargains allow you to further customize your rewards at a varying material cost.

1681
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
So we have one here, skill ranks.

1682
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Legendary armors will always possess at least one skill rank affix for X amount of gold here.

1683
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:27,000
And then the passive ranks, which you'll see a little bit more later, the legendary amulets will always possess at least one passive rank affix.

1684
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
So let's go into the next slide just to, again, recap the full flow.

1685
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:37,000
And we're going to see a video of all this to let it all kind of like soak in and see like the full flow of the undercity.

1686
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
So we have the front end experience where you interact with the spirit brazier.

1687
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:51,000
You can jump directly into your district run or you can optionally apply a tribute and then a bargain to specify the rewards opportunity of your next run.

1688
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
So let's go see this in action.

1689
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Look at that.

1690
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:02,000
So this is the hub of the undercity and that's the spirit brazier that I was mentioning.

1691
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:09,000
You can see that we have the base, you know, the base run rules, you know, starting time, no time bonus penalties, no potion drop penalties.

1692
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
And we have the opportunity to apply a tribute.

1693
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
We have four tributes here.

1694
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
So, you know, we'll show these in a still shot later so you don't have to like worry about, oh, what does it say?

1695
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:30,000
But we have four tributes here that range from magic all the way to unique to, you know, accommodate your leveling journeys.

1696
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:37,000
So for now, we applied the legendary tribute that will guarantee ancestral uniques at the end of your run.

1697
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And again, this is the list of potential bargains that I mentioned that each tribute has.

1698
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Each tribute has like varying quantities of bargains attached to it.

1699
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:51,000
So we're going to pick the passive rank legendary amulets for the low, low price of 50 million gold.

1700
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
The spirit flame services don't come cheap, but they're worth it.

1701
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
So we got the portal open and we're going to hop into the run.

1702
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
We're going to have this play a couple of times.

1703
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,000
First, I just want to point out the HUD because this is really kind of your guide to the experience.

1704
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:12,000
So you can see at the top, once we exited that spirit aura, the timer starts.

1705
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
And that's a nice little, you know, timer at the top right hand corner of your screen.

1706
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
We also display the number of floors that you have, you know, left to traverse.

1707
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Very key information right there.

1708
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:28,000
To the right hand side of the objective tracker, we have the attunement meter and it's segmented into four ranks.

1709
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Again, as I mentioned, achieving rank one is the bare minimum requirement necessary to get the value of the tribute that you slotted in.

1710
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
All subsequent ranks further enhance the value of that reward.

1711
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:50,000
So while you certainly want to strive to get, you know, attunement rank four to maximize your payout, it's not necessary if you're feeling the pinch of, you know, the time pressure.

1712
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:57,000
That if you at least get attunement rank one, you can, you know, run it to the boss room and still come away with the thing that you're looking for.

1713
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
So I'm going to point out a couple of things here.

1714
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
You might have seen, let's do the spirit beacon.

1715
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:09,000
So the spirit beacon is one of our activity types and completing it both gives you attunement, a good splash of attunement.

1716
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And it applies a momentary, you know, spirit buff that increases your movement speed and reduces your, was it the skill cooldowns.

1717
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Again, you got to move fast in the inner city.

1718
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:29,000
So these spirit beacons are incredibly useful for getting you to the next location, whether it's another spirit beacon or the exit.

1719
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
We're also kind of showing here the lesser afflicted.

1720
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
As you can see, you know, they're clearly marked in the game world.

1721
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,000
They're all, you know, orangey, glowy, so you can, you know, keep your focus on the combat.

1722
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,000
And killing them is what gives you the time bonuses to extend your run.

1723
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I think that's kind of the long and short of the inner city run.

1724
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Again, this is an example of floor one.

1725
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
There's still two more floors to traverse to get to the boss room.

1726
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
But yeah, let's hop up.

1727
01:44:59,000 --> 01:44:59,000
There we go.

1728
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
We're into the boss room.

1729
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
So in this case, we have finished all three floors.

1730
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
We made it to the boss room.

1731
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,000
One thing you'll notice that time expiration, it stops.

1732
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Time drain stops in the boss room.

1733
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
So you just need to make it to the boss room before that timer hits zero.

1734
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
This is Aaliyah, one of our three district bosses.

1735
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
And it's important to call out that there are three total districts to explore in the inner city.

1736
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Again, that's tapping into the variety aspect of things.

1737
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,000
So Aaliyah is, again, just one of three henchmen that own the various districts.

1738
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
So in this case, we're at the tail end of this fight.

1739
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
We just, you know, killed Aaliyah.

1740
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And we see that we ended this run with a full reward upgrade of four.

1741
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
So now we're going to get the best possible payout for this.

1742
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And we came in here looking for ancestral legendaries.

1743
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,000
And as the spirit flames promised, ancestral legendaries is what we get.

1744
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
And, you know, the greater affixes.

1745
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
And we also see that we got an amulet.

1746
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,000
If we were to dive into, like, the amulet, we would have seen that the bargain would have applied to it as well.

1747
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,000
So the player would have gotten specifically what they came in here for.

1748
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:15,000
So that's a really quick snapshot of just, like, the structure of an under city flow.

1749
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I want to take this time just to dive into a little bit more details on the tributes that we saw in the gameplay footage and spend a little bit more time with them.

1750
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
So this is an example of four of our eight total tributes.

1751
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:36,000
These are hand-selected primarily just to showcase how the tributes are tuned to progress with your leveling journeys.

1752
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
So we start off here with the tribute of growth.

1753
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
This is usable in all difficulty levels.

1754
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,000
This is the tribute that rewards additional experience when you complete the under city.

1755
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
So this is great, you know, for leveling up your alts, leveling up your character in general.

1756
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And you can see here that we start applying the first of the, you know, I guess penalties or challenges for this

1757
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
in the sense that we have lower starting time.

1758
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,000
We actually incur a time bonus penalty now.

1759
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And we have potion drop penalties.

1760
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Something also to note is, you know, this is just found randomly in Sanctuary.

1761
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
So as you're just doing your standard leveling stuff like the hell tides or whatever,

1762
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
you will get these types of tributes to say, you know, point you to the under city every now and again.

1763
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,000
So let's go back to the tribute gallery, as I like to call it.

1764
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Can we go back to that last slide that we had up there?

1765
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,000
There we go.

1766
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Yeah.

1767
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,000
All right.

1768
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Cool.

1769
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Thank you.

1770
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And then we get to, from there, it just gets progressively more challenging,

1771
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
but also progressively more rewarding for the players.

1772
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
So tribute of harmony rewards guaranteed runes.

1773
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
This is a torment tier difficulty.

1774
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
And you can see, you know, we just amp up the challenge with each one.

1775
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,000
The tribute of radiance is the one that we just saw in action that we guaranteed ancestral legendaries.

1776
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And the tribute of ascendance is example of kind of like the cream of the crop tribute,

1777
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:00,000
unique tribute that guarantees several uniques with an increased chance of a mythic unique.

1778
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,000
And I just want to call it out here that I know that the last two tributes say that, you know,

1779
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
they're resolute tributes and they only, you know, apply rewards to the player that offered it.

1780
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,000
We do have variants of both of these that work in party.

1781
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
So that, you know, hole is covered.

1782
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,000
The rest of the tributes that don't have that distinction, they reward everyone in the party.

1783
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
It's just these last two that, you know, kind of had that little, you know, asterisk on it.

1784
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
So, yeah, I think that's the gallery of the tributes.

1785
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:36,000
And again, these are mapped to, the rest of them are mapped to a variety of content like the whisper caches,

1786
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,000
the summoned lair bosses, and a variety of things that I'm forgetting on the spot here.

1787
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Yeah, this is a fantastic activity to do when you're somewhat in the mid game of your journey.

1788
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
So you're going to be introduced to this as you're making your way through the campaign.

1789
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
And, but the thing I like about it is with all the progression changes that we've been looking at,

1790
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
this also scales with you.

1791
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
And so this is the type of activity that's going to stick with you for a while.

1792
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,000
It's a great way to get control over looking for the items you're looking for.

1793
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
And the time attack feature of this is really great.

1794
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Yeah.

1795
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,000
And I think the big thing here is like you can do it solo or you can do it with a group.

1796
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:19,000
So it's not like you have other options if you want to bring in a full party

1797
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
or if you'd like to just conquer it yourself.

1798
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
And I know a lot of people in chat are going like, hey, 50 million for all that.

1799
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
There are, I'm not sure if you guys saw all the different bargains and everything.

1800
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
There's a plethora of different costs for a lot of different options.

1801
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,000
And depending on what you're looking for, you can obviously target specific things.

1802
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
You may specifically want, you know, uniques or something like that.

1803
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
And that like chaotic uniques, I think, had like an oval requirement or whatever.

1804
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
So there's a lot of different bargain options for players to get.

1805
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:52,000
And if you are looking for specific rewards, you have an additional avenue to do so,

1806
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
which is really cool with Curious Undercity.

1807
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:55,000
So, yeah.

1808
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Awesome.

1809
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Cool.

1810
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Well, there we go.

1811
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I think there's more, actually.

1812
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
We're not doing it.

1813
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
We're not doing it.

1814
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
It's the best prices.

1815
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Yeah.

1816
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
The Curious Undercity is the gift that keeps on giving.

1817
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,000
So, one additional activity that you'll discover as you're, you know, romping through the Undercity

1818
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,000
is our Undercity unique Treasure Goblin, the Portal Prankster.

1819
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
We'll show some gameplay footage in just a moment.

1820
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:24,000
But first, I just want to, you know, call out killing him will reward a bonus chest at the end of the dungeon.

1821
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:30,000
And in addition, that contains just standard, you know, Treasure Goblin loot, runes, and more tributes.

1822
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:37,000
So it's a really good, very juicy reward to go after the Portal Prankster when you come across him.

1823
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:43,000
But you would be doing so at your own peril because you'll see in this video that he has a particular mechanic to him

1824
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:50,000
that makes it a little bit tricky when you have a continually timer that's continually counting down.

1825
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:55,000
So you'll see here that when he's aggroed, he opens up a bunch of portals and just like Benny hills through them.

1826
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
It's a chase.

1827
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,000
So this is kind of tapping into the risk versus reward nature of the Undercity

1828
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:08,000
where you make decisions based on how confident you are at the current state of your run.

1829
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
And again, killing him is very lucrative.

1830
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
He doesn't drop anything aside from attunement right from the get-go.

1831
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
But all of his rewards are funneled at the end of the experience.

1832
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
So again, a variety of the spice of life in the Undercity.

1833
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
And just, yeah, really excited to get this into the hands of players.

1834
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Yeah, it's cool to see a new goblin variant right there.

1835
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
And then, of course, you know, the ultimate troll goblin, as you can see in the gameplay.

1836
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
And that's the risk reward you were talking about.

1837
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Like, do you spend the time chasing after this specific goblin as it's bouncing between different portals,

1838
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
as your time is ticking down and you're trying to progress and get better rewards?

1839
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
And, of course, if you succeed and you get everything, you get that extra chest at the end, which is really awesome.

1840
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Yeah, it's worth it.

1841
01:51:53,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Yeah, most definitely is worth it, especially since you get so much progress added once you do actually take down the goblin as well.

1842
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
So thank you, Derek, for walking us through this.

1843
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
We have a bunch of seats here.

1844
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:16,000
We actually have a non-physical seat here because we do actually have one other person that we're going to be tapping into to talk to us about the Dark Citadel.

1845
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
And this is Mr. Jason Bentley, who is live via satellite.

1846
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I'm going to, yeah, that's what I'm going to say, satellite.

1847
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,000
From the East Coast, Jason is our lead raid designer on Dark Citadel.

1848
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,000
And, Jason, do you want to talk to us a little bit about it?

1849
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Absolutely.

1850
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Thanks for having me.

1851
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
As you heard, I'm the lead for the Dark Citadel.

1852
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
And we're going to talk about Rise of the Khazra.

1853
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,000
This is the very first multiplayer-focused piece of content for Diablo 4.

1854
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
This page.

1855
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:58,000
So, as you can kind of guess, this whole thing is about essence and souls and sealing them and owning them and just using it as power.

1856
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Go ahead.

1857
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
So, why are we here?

1858
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
We're here to fight the first Khazra.

1859
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:13,000
They are taking over the crater left from the Mage Clan Civil War, blasted a hole into the ground, and they've moved in.

1860
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:21,000
And they're using all the souls from the dead clan, dead Mage Clan people to power their crazy experiments.

1861
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
They're really, really evil.

1862
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
They are taking people.

1863
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
They take their own kind.

1864
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
And they turn them into, like, power sources and batteries.

1865
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
And they use them.

1866
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
And they're all about resurrecting their dead god, Zagral.

1867
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:41,000
This all takes place in, or starts in Nihantu.

1868
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
You start out the whole quest line in Kuras.

1869
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
They're going to tell you how bad this is.

1870
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:55,000
They really don't like having their friends and family stolen and taken and drained and having Huss returned.

1871
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,000
So, you're going to go on a quest to go find out what's happened to these people and see if you can go help.

1872
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,000
A lot of other heroes have actually tried this, and they have all failed.

1873
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So, really, when you get through this entire experience, what you really come back with is only together can we prevail.

1874
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
We need to bring some friends with you to come to this content.

1875
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
You're not going to be able to do it on your own.

1876
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Once you get through all of this, this actually only happens at Torment 1.

1877
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
So, this is not an early leveling experience.

1878
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
This is something when you're really into the game and you really need to, like, move your build along.

1879
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:41,000
So, once you enter Torment 1, you can go on this quest and access the Ancient Nexus, which is its own town space with a waypoint of all of its own,

1880
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
which gives access to the three dungeons you can see here.

1881
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,000
These dungeons have multiple boss fights in each one, and they each take a little bit of time to get through.

1882
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Practice will help you optimize these runs.

1883
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Experience will help you show expertise in shepherding other people to show them how to complete these mechanics.

1884
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
And communication is not required, but it definitely leads to better outcomes.

1885
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:12,000
There's a lot of new challenges in mechanics, and there's really no mercy for the hardcore players.

1886
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
So, you have to be good, too.

1887
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:24,000
As you can see right now, we've actually got one party split across two different realms, doing different mechanics and helping each other, and coming back together to bring down the boss.

1888
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,000
It really takes at least two players to do these mechanics.

1889
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,000
We have multiplayer boss fights through the entire experience, and we always say the players are stronger together.

1890
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
It's tuned for four players.

1891
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Two players can do these mechanics, but it means you have to handle the mechanics and the monsters and the bosses by yourselves.

1892
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
We're not going to duck the difficulty for fewer players.

1893
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
We have lots of crazy mechanics going on.

1894
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
We've got people relying on each other to get through all of this.

1895
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,000
There's a lot of hero moments in this content.

1896
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:17,000
The best moments we had when we were playtesting this is somebody's dead, and the other person's running around, and they click the switch, or they res the other friend right in time to jump through the portal or kill the boss.

1897
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
And everyone's just screaming and having a great time.

1898
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:28,000
It's really, really fun to work together and see those moments where, depending on your party members, really pays off.

1899
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:36,000
We also have an exclusive monster family for the Dark Citadel.

1900
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
These are the newest, smartest monsters you have met.

1901
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
These are the first Kazura.

1902
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
They're pretty evil people.

1903
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Shout out to the first Kazura monster family team.

1904
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
They did a great job on all of these guys.

1905
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
They are awful.

1906
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:50,000
They're decadent.

1907
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
They're sophisticated.

1908
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
They use a lot of magic.

1909
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
They do a lot of crazy things to bring down the party.

1910
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
These are cool-looking enemies.

1911
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
That's for sure.

1912
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:13,000
I know with at least Dark Citadel, of course, there's always awesome rewards that are associated with this.

1913
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Jason, do you want to talk to us a little bit about those?

1914
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Absolutely.

1915
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I think we have that queued up.

1916
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Yeah.

1917
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Let's see if we can get that queued up here.

1918
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
The joys of...

1919
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Well, we do have...

1920
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:28,000
We did it.

1921
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Oh, actually, a quick quality of life improvement here.

1922
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:35,000
We actually have a marker system to help parties get through the experience.

1923
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
You can just drop them into your emote wheel.

1924
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:44,000
And then as you're running through the experience, you can use those emotes to indicate to your friends and party members,

1925
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Hey, I found something of interest.

1926
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Or, Hey, it's over here.

1927
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
This is the way forward.

1928
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
And a really nice thing is this is available outside the Citadel as well.

1929
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,000
It's not exclusive.

1930
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
So you'll be able to use this wherever you go with your party.

1931
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:00,000
We also have a combat log during the Citadel experience to help you understand what's happening,

1932
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
especially where you're taking damage from in big moments.

1933
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
And you've heard about the Party Finder.

1934
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:12,000
That's also created with, obviously, Citadel in mind, but it supports everybody else.

1935
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
But we want to make sure we facilitate getting lots of people into this content.

1936
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Hopefully now we can talk about rewards.

1937
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Well, before we jump into that, I do want to make mention,

1938
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:26,000
because that was a really interesting screen to see the communication stuff and talking about Party Finder.

1939
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:32,000
One of the things that we've seen since launch is that our cooperative player basis is growing.

1940
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
You know, it's growing steadily.

1941
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
And so we wanted to make sure that we did a couple of things.

1942
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,000
First off, we wanted endgame content for them, right?

1943
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:45,000
That's what this is all about, is making sure that we have that really aspirational endgame content

1944
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
for folks who like to play with their friends.

1945
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,000
The other thing is that we know that we could let this spread out into more segments of the game.

1946
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:59,000
And so the Party Fighter was originally a discussion that we had for how to support the Dark Citadel.

1947
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:04,000
But it is now benefiting all the other activities in our game as well.

1948
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:09,000
So for those of you who have experienced, you're seeing the early stages of us really expanding,

1949
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
getting people together in the content that is the best inside of the game.

1950
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
And so it's really exciting.

1951
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:22,000
But it does boil down to that communication, and that marker system is something that can be both used in the Citadel

1952
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
as well as outside of the Citadel.

1953
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:28,000
And I think that that's going to be really valuable for accessibility for a lot of folks out there.

1954
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Yep, that's definitely.

1955
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
All right, now on to rewards.

1956
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Now we'll talk rewards.

1957
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Sorry, had to get that in there.

1958
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Absolutely.

1959
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:43,000
So you're actually chasing a weekly reward that resets on the Tuesday or the day of the week that we set.

1960
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:50,000
So really, that's going to drop a massive ancestral loot drop each time you pop that open,

1961
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
which only happens when you complete all three dungeons.

1962
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
You're going to want to chase that thing.

1963
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:57,000
That is a huge, important drop for a week.

1964
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
But beyond that, there's lots of rewards for repeated runs.

1965
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:05,000
The Citadel coins are going to allow you to purchase all these consumables,

1966
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:11,000
and you can maximize the number of coins you get per run by killing treasury monsters and playing on higher difficulties.

1967
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Like, it really scales up the Citadel coins you get.

1968
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
And why do you care about those?

1969
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Well, A, these consumables really make it easier and more fun to play with groups and parties.

1970
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:28,000
But it also allows purchase of the Scroll of Restoration.

1971
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:34,000
So if you want to just chase down and buy scrolls, this is a great place to do that.

1972
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Sick slide for a production right there.

1973
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
We're doing this live, right?

1974
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Yeah, exactly.

1975
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,000
No, that's actually really cool to see.

1976
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,000
And again, the Scroll of Restoration being a reward in Dark Citadel.

1977
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,000
And like what we talked about earlier, you actually do get two guaranteed ones in the Season Journey.

1978
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
And at the same time, those are something that you can find all around the world.

1979
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
But Dark Citadel is also just like that guaranteed way of being able to get it as well.

1980
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So there's a lot of different variety of rewards.

1981
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
But it goes beyond what we just showed right there.

1982
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,000
There's actually some really, really cool stuff as well that I know Jason wants to show off us.

1983
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Absolutely.

1984
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I would love to end up on just the way everyone can show off their ability to just play this content to the top levels.

1985
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
So we're going to show you our premier gear.

1986
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
There's actually two levels of gear that you can get from playing the Dark Citadel.

1987
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:30,000
There's the normal level gear, which you'll get from Torments 1 through 3.

1988
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
And it's pretty accessible.

1989
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:39,000
But what you're seeing right now is our premier content, which comes from only completions in Torment 4.

1990
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
So I hope this is as exciting for everyone to get as I'm excited to give it to you.

1991
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
So I'll see you in the Citadel.

1992
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
And thank you for letting me show this off.

1993
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Awesome.

1994
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Thank you so much, Jason.

1995
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
To this mount.

1996
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Go back to the mount.

1997
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Go back to the mount.

1998
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I know you were probably like, oh, we've got to scroll through everything.

1999
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
But, oh, okay.

2000
02:01:59,000 --> 02:01:59,000
There we go.

2001
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
The mount is sick.

2002
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Oopsie.

2003
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Scroll through.

2004
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:04,000
There we go.

2005
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Do it live.

2006
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Okay.

2007
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Yeah.

2008
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
The mount is sick.

2009
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:12,000
That's something that I think a lot of people are going to be kind of like chasing after for sure with the Dark Citadel.

2010
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Jason, thank you so much for walking us through that.

2011
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Really excited for it.

2012
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:22,000
And what's cool is like, as Jason mentioned, Dark Citadel itself, you can do it with a group of four.

2013
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
You can even attempt to go for two people.

2014
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
If you're really skilled, you have that option of being able to do it.

2015
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,000
The Party Finder feature now being part of the game now.

2016
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:37,000
You can actually access Party Finder, find other people that may want to jump into Dark Citadel and group up with them.

2017
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:44,000
And, of course, we have the additional communication tools with all the different pings that you can end up using and markers that you can end up using

2018
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
to help kind of guide that whole entire group there.

2019
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
So lots of cool stuff coming with Dark Citadel.

2020
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Really cool endgame content that's coming to Vessel of Hatred.

2021
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
And we can't wait to see people jump into it.

2022
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Can't wait to jump into it myself.

2023
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:01,000
But, of course, we have one last topic that we do want to talk about with Vessel of Hatred.

2024
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
And that is our Mercenaries feature.

2025
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
That is something that we did announce during Gamescom.

2026
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,000
But we do want to go into a little bit of a deeper dive today on that specifically.

2027
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
So, Brent, Dan, do you guys want to take us through Mercenaries?

2028
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Yeah.

2029
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Just to kick it off, you know, Mercenaries is one of those legacy features that you've seen in multiple Diablo games.

2030
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
And when we started talking about this very early on, we're like,

2031
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:30,000
what is the approach that we can take that really complements everything else that we're doing in Diablo 4 that is different?

2032
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Obviously, we've been touching things like itemization and we've been doing a bunch of reworks on class builds.

2033
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So, we knew a couple things here.

2034
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:46,000
First, we wanted to make sure that the system was built in a way that could complement your build type, right?

2035
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,000
So, every build type has a little bit of a soft spot.

2036
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:55,000
And Mercenaries is a really good way of you can level them up in a way that can actually fill in that soft spot.

2037
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:03,000
And the other thing that we really wanted to make sure of is that they were always useful, right?

2038
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:16,000
And so, as you play along the game, you're interacting with them in way different ways than you would just by leveling up and using them basically as a power item, right?

2039
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:23,000
And so, the way that we folded this in is far more robust than we've seen in other systems in the past.

2040
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
And, yeah, I can't wait for Dan to show it off.

2041
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Awesome, yeah. Let's dive into it.

2042
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
So, I think we can go to the first slide. Awesome.

2043
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
So, we announced these characters at Gamescom.

2044
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
And these are the four Mercenaries that you're going to meet as you play Vessel of Hatred.

2045
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Early on in the campaign, you're going to meet Rahir, the guy in the middle.

2046
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:45,000
And you're going to lend him a hand in kind of tracking down these other characters, doing their questlines and unlocking them.

2047
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
And they're like really involved questlines. They're pretty awesome.

2048
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,000
They have cutscenes. They have, you know, a lot of narrative and backstory where you kind of get to know more about these characters.

2049
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,000
And they have a lot of personality, so they're pretty interesting.

2050
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
And we really want to make them feel like characters that live in the world.

2051
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:04,000
They don't just sit in the hideout the whole time when you're running around and you might see an event where they're actually participating in the event.

2052
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,000
So, you may even run into some of these characters before you unlock them.

2053
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Cool. So, today I'm going to cover a little bit more detail than what we announced at Gamescom.

2054
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I'm going to talk about play style and perk for each Mercenary.

2055
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I'm going to talk about reinforcements, which is a new way to interact with Mercenaries.

2056
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
And then we're going to talk about bartering and progression at the end.

2057
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Alright. So, I'm going to talk about the play styles for each Mercenary.

2058
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
And to start, I wanted to show an example of a skill tree.

2059
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:37,000
So, every skill tree for a Mercenary at the very top, the starting node is their perk.

2060
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
And this is a passive bonus you get whenever a Mercenary is hired into your party.

2061
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
And they're pretty awesome. They're really powerful.

2062
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Hopefully, when you hire a Merc, you feel like they're changing the way you play.

2063
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
And then every skill tree has six skills and 12 upgrades.

2064
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
So, let's dive into some examples.

2065
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:58,000
So, for Rahir, he's really like the tank if you need someone to help protect you.

2066
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And his skill tree is kind of split up into a tower shield, which is about getting in the thick of battle,

2067
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
tanking things for you, taunting.

2068
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
And he also has a round shield, which is sort of themed around being a holy protector.

2069
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
So, the top node that you start with for Rahir, and this is when you hire him to your party, is Valiant.

2070
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
And what this does is basically, if you take a lot of damage in one hit,

2071
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:25,000
he's going to fly in, negate that damage, block it for you, and he's going to knock down enemies.

2072
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
He's also going to grant you Unstoppable.

2073
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
So, he can really save your life.

2074
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
So, here's an example where this beast is going to hit me, and these guys hit pretty hard.

2075
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:34,000
So, here comes, boom.

2076
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
So, we're here kind of leapt in, he negated that damage, and he knocked them down.

2077
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:39,000
So, that's awesome.

2078
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I imagine hardcore players will gravitate towards this unless they are risk takers.

2079
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
So, definitely a very powerful perk.

2080
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Cool.

2081
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Let's talk about some upgrades.

2082
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,000
I think we skipped ahead a slide if we want to go back one.

2083
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,000
There we go.

2084
02:06:59,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Cool.

2085
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
So, here's some upgrade examples on Rahir's skill tree.

2086
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
The first one, Draw Fire.

2087
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
We're going to show a video in a second.

2088
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Whenever I use a healing potion, Rahir's going to taunt enemies near him.

2089
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
So, if you're in danger, you need health, it's going to help save you.

2090
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Iron Wolf's Virtue.

2091
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,000
When Rahir's Valiance is triggered, he heals you, and his cooldown is reduced.

2092
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
So, you can just get it to happen more often.

2093
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,000
And he has a shield throw, which some D3 Crusader players might love, where he chucks his shield.

2094
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
It bounces off some targets, and this kind of marks them.

2095
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
So, you can sort of play whack-a-mole, and if you hit those targets, you'll get healed back.

2096
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
So, it's another way to keep yourself alive.

2097
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
All right.

2098
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Cool.

2099
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Let's check out an example for Draw Fire.

2100
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
So, you're going to see I use my potion.

2101
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
The UI would help you show it.

2102
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,000
But, yeah.

2103
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
I use the potion right there.

2104
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Rahir taunted everybody.

2105
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Sweet.

2106
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
I did not die, and I'm happy.

2107
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:47,000
All right.

2108
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Let's go to the next one.

2109
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
So, Varyana.

2110
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
We call her the Berserker Crone.

2111
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
She is a reformed cannibal.

2112
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
She's got a pretty interesting backstory.

2113
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I love her personality.

2114
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
She's kind of zany and crazy.

2115
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:07,000
She's also the cook for the mercenaries, and I don't know if I would eat her food.

2116
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I don't really trust her.

2117
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,000
But her skill tree is kind of split up into two themes.

2118
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Dual-wield axes, which is all about visceral cleaves and bleeds.

2119
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
And large mace, which is heavy slams.

2120
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:22,000
So, you may be familiar with the massacre bonus from D3.

2121
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Her perk is very similar.

2122
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Where, basically, you get this bonus.

2123
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
We could jump to the video.

2124
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:32,000
And as you kill monsters, you're going to see when I get ten kills, the massacre bonus kicks in.

2125
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
It's going to show up above her portrait on the left side of the screen.

2126
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
So, it should say times ten.

2127
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Cool.

2128
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I now have a massacre bonus started.

2129
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:43,000
As I build this up and I get it to higher thresholds, I'm going to get more and more movement speed.

2130
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
So, you're kind of encouraged to play more aggressive.

2131
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Keep this going before it runs out of time.

2132
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:52,000
And it sort of snowballs into this fun gameplay where you're going really fast.

2133
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:59,000
So, you can embrace your inner Sanic and go real fast with Variana as your hired merc.

2134
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
All right.

2135
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
I got some upgrades for Variana.

2136
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
So, Dismembering is...

2137
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Oh, yeah.

2138
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Sorry.

2139
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
So, this one is going to guarantee an overpower.

2140
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
She's going to knock people down.

2141
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
And you get a guaranteed overpower.

2142
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
So, if you're playing Barb, it's going to be really useful.

2143
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Reprisal is when you get CC'd, Variana is going to leap on the enemy that inflicted it and knock them down.

2144
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
So, this can also save your life.

2145
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
And no escape is Variana does whirlwind.

2146
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
This makes it really big.

2147
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
And as she's spinning around, she's kind of grouping enemies up for you.

2148
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
So, that can be a fun one.

2149
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I think we showed both.

2150
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:33,000
So, yeah.

2151
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Dismembering here.

2152
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
So, she's going to set us up.

2153
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
We get a guaranteed overpower.

2154
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
You do a bunch of damage.

2155
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Sweet.

2156
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
That feeds into, you know, a lot of builds.

2157
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
And then we have Reprisal here.

2158
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
So, I got chained by that monster.

2159
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
She leapt on them, knocked them down.

2160
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Basically, canceling that for me.

2161
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
All right.

2162
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Cool.

2163
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Subo the Bounty Hunter.

2164
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:57,000
He's themed on longbows, which is precision shooting and traps.

2165
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,000
The other side of his tree is crossbows, heavy bolts, and explosives.

2166
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
And his perk is kind of broken up into two parts.

2167
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,000
So, he has a passive component, which is he reveals enemies and materials on the mini-map.

2168
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:15,000
And his active component is that he, we call him the Bounty Hunter, because he's going to call out targets during combat.

2169
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,000
And if you kill that target, you get a bunch of resource back.

2170
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,000
And also, the more you do that, the more often he's going to be casting Seeker.

2171
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:28,000
So, you're kind of trying to keep this up, where you want to make sure you're killing his targets and spending your resource before you do so.

2172
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
And this lets you just cast more abilities, which always feels great.

2173
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:33,000
All right.

2174
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Let's check out an example.

2175
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:35,000
So, I'm in town.

2176
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I'm going to walk out here with Subo.

2177
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And you can look at the mini-map, top right.

2178
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
And it's starting to populate with herbs and ore veins.

2179
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
And you'll see all the monsters on the mini-map as well.

2180
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
So, that's kind of his scouting component.

2181
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,000
And, sorry, we're going to have to loop this one, because I talk too slowly.

2182
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
But he also is marking a target.

2183
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
And you saw when I killed them, I got a bunch of resource.

2184
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Yeah, I know a lot of people with Subo, especially, because the fact that he highlights, like, ore veins and things like that are pretty huge.

2185
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:18,000
For people, especially with all the changes that we're adding to, like, how materials can also be used to maybe craft, like, legendaries and stuff.

2186
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
So, Subo is kind of, like, my personal favorite.

2187
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:26,000
It definitely embraces, I think, what Brent was talking about, too, where mercenaries are really about utility.

2188
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
And they kind of add choices that maybe you wouldn't necessarily pick on your character.

2189
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Or they help you just kind of, like, fill gaps in your build.

2190
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Or maybe encourage you to do, you know, have more diversity in your build.

2191
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Maybe they expose new options for you.

2192
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:39,000
So, it's pretty interesting.

2193
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
All right, cool.

2194
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
We're going to show off some Subo upgrades.

2195
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:50,000
So, first, we have Share a Drink, which is whenever he throws his Molotov, there's a chance for him to drop a healing potion for you.

2196
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Mastermind, Subo's Wire Trap and Trip Minds gain 60% size.

2197
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
And then you and Subo both have increased crowd control duration.

2198
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Thrill Seeker is going to reduce cooldowns for every monster hit.

2199
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
So, here's an example of Share a Drink.

2200
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,000
He threw a Molotov.

2201
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
He dropped a potion for me.

2202
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:12,000
And that can just help you more consistently get potions, which could definitely be useful for a lot of players.

2203
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:14,000
All right.

2204
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Oldkin.

2205
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
This is definitely a fan favorite.

2206
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
We call him the Forsaken Child.

2207
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
His tree is sort of split up into two magic types.

2208
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Fire magic, which is all about burning enemies and making them suffer.

2209
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:31,000
And shadow magic, which is haunting souls that kind of like apply dots and spread to enemies.

2210
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:37,000
His perk is dependent on what your skill tree choices are.

2211
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
So, if you're on the fire side of the tree or the shadow, you will get different buffs and debuffs.

2212
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
So, every once in a while, he's going to turn into a demon of one of those forms.

2213
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
If he's on the shadow side, you and all the enemies around him become vulnerable.

2214
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:55,000
If he's on the fire side, he's going to make it so all your direct damage applies burn to enemies.

2215
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
But it's also draining your resource.

2216
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
So, he's really themed around this kiss curse mechanic.

2217
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
And whenever this happens, it can be a huge benefit.

2218
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
But also, there's some downsides to it, potentially.

2219
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
All right.

2220
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Cool.

2221
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
So, he's casting some fire skills.

2222
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
We're going to see Oldkin on the left.

2223
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
He's turning into a fire demon.

2224
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
This gives him a whole new skill set.

2225
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
He's got immolation.

2226
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,000
He's burning nearby enemies.

2227
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
And he's helping kill everything.

2228
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
And then you can see when I'm doing direct damage, it's applying burn.

2229
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
But also, my resource is draining.

2230
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
This is if I'm on the shadow side.

2231
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
He turned into a shadow demon at the top.

2232
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
He's going to do a cool ability where he pulls everyone into a line, lines them up for you.

2233
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
That always feels really good.

2234
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
And yeah.

2235
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
In that one, he's making everyone vulnerable.

2236
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Sweet.

2237
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Let's talk about some upgrades for Oldkin.

2238
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
So, I think this will be a lot of people's favorites.

2239
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Ember's Gift.

2240
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Whenever he casts Firestorm, if you stand in it, you're getting 33% of your primary resource per second.

2241
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
And we're going to show a video of that in a sec.

2242
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Terrify.

2243
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
He does Haunt.

2244
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Yeah, thank you.

2245
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:56,000
He's got a 30% chance to apply invulnerable to enemies.

2246
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
So, another way to get keywords applied to things.

2247
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
And Burning Chaos.

2248
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,000
That's his ult.

2249
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Whenever you cast your ult, it resets his.

2250
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Wave of Flame is really cool.

2251
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,000
It's this giant fire wave that destroys enemy projectiles.

2252
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,000
You can kind of run with it and fight inside of it.

2253
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
And I've seen a lot of people get use out of that.

2254
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Cool.

2255
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Okay.

2256
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Let's check out Ember's Gift.

2257
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
So, he's going to cast Firestorm.

2258
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
And look at my resource.

2259
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
It's just flying up really fast while I'm standing in this area.

2260
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
So, it's a good way to kind of have this happen.

2261
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
And then you just get to spam a bunch of abilities.

2262
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
And Murder Monsters.

2263
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
So, yeah.

2264
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Here's a quick example of, you know.

2265
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,000
We do have a lot of keywords and ways for mercenaries to utilize them and spread them to enemies.

2266
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
So, that can help with a lot of builds, too.

2267
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Yeah.

2268
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:44,000
It's nice having an option to, like, add vulnerable to more enemies.

2269
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Especially, like, doing AOE or anything like that.

2270
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
So, yeah.

2271
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Really cool to see.

2272
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
I know, of course, we have.

2273
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,000
There's other mechanics with mercenaries that we did want to talk about.

2274
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:59,000
So, Dan, do you want to jump into how reinforcements actually works?

2275
02:14:59,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Yeah.

2276
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Let's talk about reinforcements.

2277
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,000
So, I guess before I explain reinforcements, there are two methods of using mercenaries.

2278
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,000
One is hiring them.

2279
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,000
And that's for solo players.

2280
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
So, if you're playing solo, you're not in a party, you can hire a mercenary.

2281
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Everyone, at all times, can also have a reinforcement.

2282
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
So, if you're in a party, everyone has a reinforcement.

2283
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
If you're solo, you get both.

2284
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
And if you're playing solo, they have to be two different characters.

2285
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
So, your hired mercenary has to be different from your reinforcement.

2286
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:26,000
All right.

2287
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
What the heck are reinforcements?

2288
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:33,000
So, reinforcements are a new way to interact with mercs where you can kind of call a mercenary into battle,

2289
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
have them perform a skill at an opportune moment.

2290
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
And you get to sort of control when that happens.

2291
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,000
And this reminds me a lot of, like, old school fighting games where you can kind of cast an ability

2292
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
and a character will fly in off screen.

2293
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
He'll do something really cool.

2294
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Hopefully, that helps you a lot.

2295
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,000
And that's, you know, I think very much inspired by that.

2296
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Yeah.

2297
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
It's like assist.

2298
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,000
They jump in, they do something, and then they, like, pop back out.

2299
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
So, it's really cool.

2300
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
So, you're going to choose an opportunity, which is when does it happen?

2301
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
You could link this to any of your action bar slots.

2302
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:06,000
So, you could say, hey, when I press one and I teleport, the mercenary does this skill.

2303
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,000
And then you choose a skill that you have unlocked for that mercenary.

2304
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:10,000
All right.

2305
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Let's check out some examples.

2306
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
So, this one's quick.

2307
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I'm going to cast teleport.

2308
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
And you'll see Rahir appear.

2309
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
And then he sort of flies in battle.

2310
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
He does this triple slam.

2311
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,000
He groups everyone up.

2312
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Grouping enemies up is always good.

2313
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Thank you, Rahir.

2314
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I drop a meteor on their head.

2315
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
In this one, we cast bone prison.

2316
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
And Ultkin shows up and casts firestorm for me.

2317
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:35,000
There's going to be a lot of combinations here, I think, with, you know, all the different player abilities and all the different reinforcement skills.

2318
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,000
So, I think it'll be really interesting to see how players utilize the system.

2319
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,000
You can use it more defensively or more offensively.

2320
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:47,000
And hopefully you agree, a lot of the skills give you added utility.

2321
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,000
So, I think there's a lot of opportunities here to mix and match, which would be cool.

2322
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Another thing I'm excited about that is that the system is built to grow.

2323
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:02,000
And so, our ability to add more conditions in which you bring them in and continue to grow potentially the powers that we can see, too.

2324
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
It's a very robust system that can go a pretty long way.

2325
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
So, it's great.

2326
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Yeah.

2327
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Cool.

2328
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Awesome.

2329
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,000
And I think, finally, we want to talk about some bartering.

2330
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Yeah.

2331
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
We're going to talk about rapport, which is the progression.

2332
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
And then bartering.

2333
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
But they're all tied together.

2334
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
It's all one unit.

2335
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:17,000
We're good.

2336
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:17,000
It's all tied.

2337
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Yeah.

2338
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
So, rapport is the progression for mercenaries.

2339
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,000
And we could go ahead and jump to the first slide.

2340
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
So, this is what the rapport looks like.

2341
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
You may be familiar with this type of UI.

2342
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
In this example, we're rank five.

2343
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
The first four skill ranks are how you get your skill points for the skill tree.

2344
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
We want you to unlock all the cool, fun abilities for mercs pretty quickly and up front.

2345
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,000
After that point, it's all about upgrades for bartering.

2346
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
And bartering, as we're going to show it off in a second,

2347
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:48,000
but progressing your mercs improves the bartering system,

2348
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:53,000
which is kind of a way to trade with mercenaries at the hideout and get really useful items.

2349
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,000
So, the very last rank, we hovered over it quickly there.

2350
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,000
You can actually repeat the very last rank for mercenaries and continue to earn the currency.

2351
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
So, if you say, hey, I really like Ultkin.

2352
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
I don't want to level anyone else up.

2353
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,000
You could just keep playing this character and you'll keep getting resources.

2354
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Hopefully, we're encouraging you, though, with these upgrades to kind of rank up all your mercs

2355
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
and keep making bartering better.

2356
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
All right, let's talk about bartering.

2357
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:26,000
So, at the hideout, you can talk to Fiera and she will pull up a UI where you can trade for items.

2358
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
A lot of them are legendaries.

2359
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,000
And as you upgrade your mercs, you're going to basically increase this list so you can find more interesting things.

2360
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Hopefully, you can find some really cool legendary items that you're excited about.

2361
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,000
As you upgrade your mercs, you're going to get more chances for legendaries.

2362
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,000
And each mercenary has an aspect category associated with them.

2363
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:50,000
So, Ultkin, for example, gives you resource aspect caches.

2364
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,000
So, if you level up Ultkin, that has a chance.

2365
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Instead of getting a resource legendary, you're going to get a resource legendary aspect cache.

2366
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
And in this case, we open one of those caches.

2367
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Sweet, I got a bunch of items.

2368
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:07,000
It's not exactly target farming, but it's a way to increase your chances of things you may be looking for.

2369
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:12,000
There's going to be a lot of other really useful items in here like crafting materials, boss summoning parts,

2370
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
some masterworking recipes, things like that.

2371
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
And that's about it.

2372
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
So, you can restock the supply on this.

2373
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:27,000
And the currency you re-roll this inventory with is the same currency that you're spending to buy items.

2374
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
So, you kind of have to pick and choose like, do I want to re-roll or do I want to wait?

2375
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,000
And hopefully you see things that you're interested in and you buy them.

2376
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,000
And then every day when you log in, you get one free re-roll.

2377
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Just trying to be nice to the players.

2378
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Hopefully you get what you want without having to waste all your pale marks.

2379
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
And I think that's all we have for mercenaries today.

2380
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:47,000
So, thank you for...

2381
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:47,000
That's awesome.

2382
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Yeah, I love hearing about the bartering system because it's just another avenue for like,

2383
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,000
hey, if I need masterworking materials or if I need boss summoning materials,

2384
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I can literally go and check and see if I can barter for it now

2385
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,000
as another opportunity for getting those specific things, which is really, really cool to see.

2386
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
So, Dan, thank you very much for walking us through the mercenaries coming to Vessel of Hatred.

2387
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:17,000
And so, everything that this group actually talked about here, this is all exclusive to Vessel of Hatred.

2388
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:21,000
So, with the expansion and anyone who actually ends up purchasing the expansion,

2389
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:26,000
they'll be able to access all the different features that we talked about from Spiritborn

2390
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
to Curious Under City to Dark Citadel and, of course, the mercenaries.

2391
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:36,000
So, lots of stuff in the expansion specifically for this that we're all excited for everyone to jump into.

2392
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:42,000
October 7th, 4 p.m. Pacific in California, globally, wherever your time zone is.

2393
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
That it's tied to that.

2394
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
That is when it will end up hitting.

2395
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
So, we have a cool map.

2396
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,000
But I know we talked about a lot today.

2397
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:54,000
We do want to, of course, do our normal Q&A that we always do at the end.

2398
02:20:54,000 --> 02:21:02,000
But before we actually end up doing that, I know, Brent, you wanted to talk a little bit about the journey here.

2399
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Yeah, honestly, you know, we talk at the team level a lot about our communication with the community at this point.

2400
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:13,000
And I've said it a few times where it's like it feels so good to be in a dialogue now.

2401
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:16,000
And everybody at home, you've heard us say, we're listening, we're listening.

2402
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:20,000
I actually feel like we're well beyond that point at this moment.

2403
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Like, we really feel like the community is now one of our team members.

2404
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:28,000
And we're developing together at this point.

2405
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:32,000
And we're starting to all pull in the same direction.

2406
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
And we've learned so much, right?

2407
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
We've come out with Season 1.

2408
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
We took some lumps there, right?

2409
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
We knew we had a lot of work to do.

2410
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:46,000
And all the dialogue that we've had has led up to things like the success of Season 4 and Season 5.

2411
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:54,000
And so the fact that the community is really a part of our team now, it shows us a great pathway.

2412
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
We still have a lot of work to do.

2413
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
You know, there's things we want to get to.

2414
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Yeah.

2415
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Armory.

2416
02:21:59,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Yeah.

2417
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Armory.

2418
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,000
We just end development.

2419
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Yeah.

2420
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:05,000
So we talked about that a little bit at Gamescom.

2421
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:08,000
But these are the types of things that are really fine-tuning the way we can get there.

2422
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:12,000
And honestly, we couldn't get there without all of you at home.

2423
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Thank you for staying with us on this journey.

2424
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Can't wait to get to the Q&A.

2425
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Yeah.

2426
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Yeah.

2427
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Yeah.

2428
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:24,000
And again, just to reiterate what Brent was saying, I think the community is speaking about how they really wanted us to have a PTR,

2429
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,000
having those PTR moments, having players in earlier, being able to provide that feedback.

2430
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Huge shout-out to you guys for being able to help us out with this journey that we've been on.

2431
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:42,000
We've made some massive strides since the first season, and it's only getting better from here, which is really cool.

2432
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:43,000
So awesome.

2433
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Well, I think we're going to jump into the Q&A.

2434
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:54,000
We're actually going to bring some people in from before, swap people out, do the musical chair thing again, musical chairs thing again.

2435
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,000
And we'll see you here in a minute for the Q&A.

2436
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:02,000
If you guys have questions, please start teeing them up in chat, and we'll try to get to as many questions as possible.

2437
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
So we'll see you in a minute.

2438
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Thank you.

2439
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Thank you.

2440
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Thank you.

2441
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:34,000
We'll be right back.

2442
02:23:34,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Thank you.

2443
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Thank you.

2444
02:24:34,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Thank you.

2445
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Thank you.

2446
02:25:34,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Thank you.

2447
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Thank you.

2448
02:26:34,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Thank you.

2449
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Thank you.

2450
02:27:34,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Thank you.

2451
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Thank you.

2452
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Thank you.

2453
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Thank you.

2454
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Thank you.

2455
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Thank you.

2456
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Thank you.

2457
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Thank you.

2458
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Thank you.

2459
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Thank you.

2460
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Thank you.

2461
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Thank you.

2462
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Thank you.

2463
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Thank you.

2464
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
So,

2465
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
this is from,

2466
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Razzle,

2467
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
this is actually from,

2468
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
this is from,

2469
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,000
this is from a lot of people.

2470
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,000
This is from a lot of people.

2471
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Speaking of D2,

2472
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I'm wearing my D2 jacket.

2473
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Will we get the D4 campfire screen back?

2474
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:46,000
So, we were talking about it during the interstitial just a little bit. Yeah, I think if we could feel a vibe through a monitor, like that was the moment that came through. You know, we hear it loud and clear. One of the things that we are doing is trying to set ourselves up for success, for adding more.

2475
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Classes to the mix. And so, the campfire is one of those things where we're taking a look at it and trying to figure out how that would work. And so we updated it where we are kind of like really in and you don't get that initial setup. So that is something that like immediately when the feedback started coming out, I think it was a little bit earlier.

2476
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:27,000
We had to make sure we had a lot of feedback that we needed to do, but we needed to do more. And so we updated it where we are kind of like really in and you don't get that initial setup. So that is something that like immediately when the feedback started coming through, the team started to mobilize and talk about what we can do. Turning it around in time fast enough for like Vessel of Hatred was we had other things like balance and polish that we really wanted to pay attention to.

2477
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Make sure some of the UI elements for some of the new features were in a good spot. So we hear you. I love the fact that the nostalgia means so much. And so the team is actively talking about it and we'll be able to get back to you in the future.

2478
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Awesome. Yeah, that was by far a very, very popular topic after PTR. They're like, where's the campfire?

2479
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Every moment we learn.

2480
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I can see like the flames kind of like in the screen, but where is like the full on campfire?

2481
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Yeah.

2482
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:06,000
We have a question from Ram Zero, which is, will there be more renown and statues of Lilith in this expansion? How does that specifically work?

2483
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Yeah, we're not going to be doing statues of Lilith specifically. We're going to be having a new statue type.

2484
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
The Tenant of Akurat.

2485
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Tenant of Akurat, which is, it's not going to give you any points, but it is working towards renown. And so there's still a lot of discoverability in the zone, but we're shifting things to work more for renown.

2486
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Yeah. And statues of Lilith, of course, are still in the base.

2487
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
They still exist.

2488
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:32,000
They still exist.

2489
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Thank you for clarifying.

2490
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:41,000
The stats, we're just not giving stats for the Tenant of Akurat because we saw how frustrated players were with like having to do this sort of activity to get more powerful.

2491
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Correct.

2492
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
So it's a lot more leaning into the collectible aspect.

2493
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Yeah.

2494
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:50,000
We didn't want these to feel like a chore that you needed to do in order to progress your player power. It's all about the discoverability, right?

2495
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Yeah.

2496
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,000
In the new zone.

2497
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Yeah.

2498
02:32:53,000 --> 02:33:04,000
And I will say that the other thing with renown specifically, like we made changes. It's something we talked about during the PTR, but we kind of optimized it a little bit better.

2499
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Because there was like paragon points at the last tier of renown and that's actually been like swapped back around now. So it's more of like the oval upgrades are at the last tier.

2500
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Yeah. Yeah. It's easier to get that potent power from paragon. We also just sort of reduced how much renown you need for a lot of these things.

2501
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:23,000
So if you missed out on renown when the game came out, it's a lot easier to get that power.

2502
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Yeah. It's good. Good way for people, like especially friends who maybe are jumping into Diablo 4 just to like kind of catch up specifically from that end.

2503
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:41,000
One thing, this just dawned on me that I did want to also mention is that, you know, back in Season 3, we introduced the gauntlet.

2504
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:51,000
And that has, you know, the leaderboard mechanics and stuff like that. One thing I do want to actually do a quick call out on is like when Season 6 starts and when Vessel of Hatred actually does ship.

2505
02:33:51,000 --> 02:34:00,000
We do plan on actually sunsetting the gauntlet and the leaderboard functionality there. Does that mean leaderboards are going away forever? No, that doesn't mean leaderboards are going away forever.

2506
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:05,000
We're actually looking at new ways of potentially finding a home for it.

2507
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Yeah. I'd rather say like leaderboards are vaulted as we do a big reassessment on how that applies to the new progression actually we're looking at releasing with Season 6.

2508
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:21,000
So I think that there's a lot of opportunity there. But again, we've made so much change.

2509
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:26,000
It's a time to take a deep breath and then take a look at the things that we really want to invest into.

2510
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Yeah. Awesome. Almost forgot about that. I wanted to mention that.

2511
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:35,000
There's a question from Avvience which is saying like, hey, how does Group Finder work?

2512
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:42,000
This was actually available during PTR and I know not everyone got to experience PTR but kind of like Party Finder itself.

2513
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Of course, you can use it across multitudes of activities from Dark Citadel, beyond Dark Citadel, which is being introduced in Vessel of Hatred.

2514
02:34:50,000 --> 02:35:01,000
But it is a feature that you can also use or that allows you to actually use filters and different ways of searching for specific groups and people.

2515
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:07,000
So we do recommend jumping in, checking out the Party Finder. It's actually super, super awesome.

2516
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:11,000
And I know there's going to be improvements that will continuously be made to it.

2517
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Yeah. Another system that we're trying to develop in a way that can grow with the player.

2518
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:21,000
And so we got it out in PTR to try to get an initial round of feedback on the types of filters that we could potentially see.

2519
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:26,000
You know, as we add the activities to the game, we want to make sure that those are plugging into it as well.

2520
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:32,000
We do think that this game is a ton of fun if you're playing together. And so we've designed it to do exactly that.

2521
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:38,000
We have a question regarding Opals and Tributes that we kind of showed off.

2522
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Tributes, of course, being part of Cure Ass Under City, Opals being part of the new season.

2523
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,000
This question was from PVE Sweat.

2524
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Great.

2525
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:57,000
I think the initial reaction is seeing some of these new consumables.

2526
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:00,000
So, Tim, I think this would be a quick question for you.

2527
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Like seeing these new consumables, are they actually stackable in inventory?

2528
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can stack them in inventory.

2529
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:10,000
In fact, if you want, you have the option, you can go just farm the Realm Walker over and over again,

2530
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:16,000
get a whole bunch of the Opals, and then just, okay, I'm going to play now for hours and hours with the buff active,

2531
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:19,000
if that's something you want to do. And Tributes as well are stackable.

2532
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Awesome.

2533
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:25,000
I did like the fact, too, I don't know, I can't recall if we mentioned it, but you get two Tributes with every drop.

2534
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Yes.

2535
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:27,000
And so you don't...

2536
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Sorry, two Opals.

2537
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Two Opals, sorry.

2538
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Yeah.

2539
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
So you can like use one now and save one for later, and so you can really determine like,

2540
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:42,000
you can actually stack these up for a longer play session later on if you wanted to play in the weekend and actually really dig in.

2541
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:53,000
There is a question regarding Mercenaries. It's actually a question I've seen. Maybe it's a two-parter, but a lot of people are asking specifically like,

2542
02:36:53,000 --> 02:37:05,000
hey, do Mercenaries... How does the progression of Mercenaries kind of carry over? Is it something that's across like the whole entire account? Or is it like from season to season? How does that specifically work?

2543
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Yeah. So they're partition-wide. So if you're playing in the season and you unlock the Mercs and you progress a bunch of them and then you roll an Alt, that progression is still there.

2544
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:28,000
But we do reset every season because it's a part of the power journey and we want to make sure you're doing that. But as you're playing, there's a lot of benefits to investing into them, especially if you're going to roll a second class.

2545
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:43,000
There is a question. I'm not sure if others will be able to get this one, but this might be tied to some of the rune word stuff that we showed, but this is God King Moonen says,

2546
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:54,000
how do those spirit wolves damage scaling work? I think they're talking specifically about the rune words that we were showing and everything like that.

2547
02:37:54,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Yeah, I can talk a bit about that. I believe the spirit wolves are not currently scaling with things like if you have summoning damage for a Necromancer.

2548
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:16,000
A lot of that damage scaling talks directly to your skeleton summons at the moment. So I don't believe they'll necessarily scale with those sources.

2549
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I'd have to check on precisely which ones it does. But that's definitely something that we're aware of and really want to make sure that we can deliver on that fantasy.

2550
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:41,000
And we'll be looking at making updates to minions and summons as a general matter going forward to really make sure that they're scaling with the right things that players expect to really make those builds feel natural and synergistic as you would expect.

2551
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
So that's definitely an area of focus for us moving forward.

2552
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Yeah, we definitely have talked a lot about this online. It'd be cool if you could be a summoner barb called Ancients and having them deal bulkier damage.

2553
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
So that's something we definitely talk a lot about.

2554
02:38:54,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Yeah, we don't have any particular thing to announce or the exact initiative at this moment, but it's definitely on our radar and it's something we are actively working on and talking about all the time.

2555
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Awesome. I know that I am the berm asked this is back to Tim actually because I think you had mentioned like farming realm walkers and they're going like, okay, so is it a world event?

2556
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:23,000
How often does it spawn? Like what like do we have like specifics on that? We can help clarify on that specific question.

2557
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:30,000
It is a world event. Yeah, and it is really focused around just that boss. It's not a world boss exactly. It is a world event.

2558
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Like was explained by Don earlier in the cast, you have to kind of follow him for a while before you're allowed to kill him.

2559
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:43,000
But it is something that you do with other people in the area. There's likely to be a bunch of other people helping you take down this boss.

2560
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:55,000
And then the realm walker itself does pop up in another location in Sanctuary pretty much right away. There's a slight break, but at any given time we want the experience to be I log in, I'm ready to go play.

2561
02:39:55,000 --> 02:40:01,000
I see like, I don't have any opals. Can I go get some? We want the answer to pretty much always be yes. Like there's always a realm walker up somewhere that you can go kill.

2562
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:12,000
So I guess you can get slightly unlucky like he just died, but you're not waiting more than a few minutes before another one's going to pop up and you can go kill that one. So if you want to chain farm them, you can.

2563
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Yeah, just run back to town vendor some stuff by the time you come back. It will probably be a like, you know, an ideal time to actually farm it.

2564
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:23,000
So it's actually really good to hear that. That's just always available for players pretty or nearly always available for players.

2565
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Question from Plucky Villain for season six on live like from a tuning and balance perspective is pit 100 still intended to be like that unobtainable goal or is there are we expecting some of like the most skilled players and dedicated players to kind of clear it?

2566
02:40:39,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Yeah, I'd say we will be surprised but not surprised I guess to see people get to pit tier 100 just with the amount of things that we're adding into the game. Charles, you know, in our previous segment talked about how much volatility has been introduced in the expansion. We actually think that's really fun. Like there's a ton of new things to explore. A ton of new things to break. And we think that probably most people won't get to 100 but you might get a surprise if you go to 100 and go past it.

2567
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Yeah, we might have done something there. Yeah, we talked quite a bit about where the deep end of the pool is, right?

2568
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:23,000
It's around 80. Around 80. Yeah, but yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing which kind of streamers out there actually push way past that so we can take a look.

2569
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Definitely. Your Sparrow asks, if we complete the campaign in an eternal realm, will we be able to skip it when we create a seasonal character?

2570
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Yes, as soon as you complete the campaign for the first time you'll be able to skip it. Very similar to what we did in the base game.

2571
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Yeah, and I think there's actually like additional nuances that we've added with Vessel of Hatred. Like for instance, if you are brand new to Diablo, of course we recommend you start from the base game and experience the campaign and that journey.

2572
02:41:51,000 --> 02:42:10,000
But even if you are coming into Diablo 4 with Vessel of Hatred and you just want to start with Vessel of Hatred, you really just need to complete that prologue of the base game and then you will then get that option I believe to skip the base campaign and you can actually jump into the expansion campaign.

2573
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
You actually don't even have to complete the prologue.

2574
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Oh, there we go.

2575
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:14,000
You even took out that point.

2576
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,000
You're a liar, Adam. You're a liar.

2577
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:33,000
And we've taken great care of you too. So like if you're new and you skip forward, when you go to go into Vessel of Hatred, we actually do recaps. So we'll catch up on the story even if you decide to do it. So if your friends are all way ahead of you and you want to skip so that you can catch up, you're good.

2578
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Yeah. We got one of those like in the last episode of whatever.

2579
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Yeah. It's really good.

2580
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Yeah. It's actually really cool to watch. So just in case if you're new to everything.

2581
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:51,000
There's another detail too, which is like once you play through the Vessel of Hatred story section, we want way more players to get into the end game.

2582
02:42:51,000 --> 02:43:00,000
We notice that there's a lot of folks out there that once they get their big story beats done, it's not really clear on where to go from there.

2583
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:05,000
And so we created a custom quest that can actually bridge you out into the end game.

2584
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:09,000
And so if you can continue following your golden baubles, that would be super good.

2585
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Cool. Awesome.

2586
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,000
We're seeing a sign in the peanut gallery.

2587
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:17,000
I'm looking at it.

2588
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Oh, I was stuck.

2589
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:21,000
I was like, what is pretty? No one can see it obviously.

2590
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
They think we're psycho because we're like looking back on what's going on.

2591
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
The coolest view is behind this camera.

2592
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Production's like holding up the sign and stuff.

2593
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Everybody that makes us look good is back there. So thank you guys.

2594
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Yes. Thank you very much.

2595
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:35,000
We're going to take, I guess, like one more specific question here.

2596
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Let me see.

2597
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:44,000
This is actually a question regarding people that are running specifically in Dark Citadel.

2598
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Like if someone leaves during Dark Citadel, like what happens to the group specifically?

2599
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Can they all just leave? They're not like locked in there.

2600
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Like, oh gosh, I'm stuck in that type of situation.

2601
02:43:55,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Or if I can conquer it with like maybe if it's four people and we drop to three, like you can adapt and kind of work your way through it.

2602
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:08,000
You can. Like we said, the game, the Citadel is down balance for four.

2603
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:13,000
But if that was to drop, as long as you got two strong players still in the mix, you should be good to go.

2604
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
So yes, it makes it more difficult.

2605
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:19,000
I'd have a firm conversation with the person who decided to drop in the middle of a fight.

2606
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:24,000
But yeah, you're still going to be able to progress through it.

2607
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Awesome. Cool.

2608
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Well, I know we've been going for a while here and we wanted to grab as many questions as possible so we don't keep people too long.

2609
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Because the biggest thing as well is like after at the end of the stream, we are releasing the patch notes.

2610
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
And I know a lot of people want to dive into the patch notes.

2611
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:48,000
But I guess before we kind of drop off, like Brent, I know you wanted to give a quick message out as well.

2612
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Yeah, you know, we saw this really cool piece of art that was made by one of our art directors on the team.

2613
02:44:55,000 --> 02:45:02,000
And it just really reminded us that there are hundreds of people working on this game all of the time.

2614
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:13,000
And these live streams are for our community, but it's also for all the folks who have been working tirelessly over the last dozens of months on trying to make this a reality.

2615
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:16,000
And so we just want to say thank you to everybody that's putting the hard work in.

2616
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:19,000
And we're still putting the hard work in today.

2617
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Like we're working all the way up through this.

2618
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,000
And so we love the team.

2619
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:23,000
We love you guys.

2620
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Keep up the good work.

2621
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,000
And yeah, we'll see you on the other side of October 8th.

2622
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:29,000
October 8th.

2623
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Yeah.

2624
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Huge shout out to Team 3, Team Diablo.

2625
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,000
You guys kick ass.

2626
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Yeah.

2627
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Best team.

2628
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:38,000
We're super proud of everyone with a vessel of hatred and everything.

2629
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:41,000
And we're super excited for October 8th.

2630
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:42,000
There's a lot of stuff coming up.

2631
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:45,000
We have patch notes immediately after this stream.

2632
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:50,000
I want to give a huge shout out to everyone here and of course who was on the live stream today.

2633
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
It's always fun doing these live streams.

2634
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
It's a big scramble.

2635
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:57,000
This is the most amount of people we've ever had on a live stream.

2636
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:05,000
So huge shout out to our production team and of course our community team like with Mr. Filthy Rich back there who organizes all these great...

2637
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
That's his handle guys.

2638
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Who handles, who handles, handles, haha.

2639
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
All these specific streams every single time.

2640
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:14,000
This is our 20th stream.

2641
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
It's crazy to see how everything has grown.

2642
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Big reminders on Twitch drops.

2643
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
We have all the information on Diablo4.com.

2644
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Twitch drops will actually start on October 8th.

2645
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:30,000
And if you're in the US, you can grab trolleys and grab more in-game stuff as I eat trolleys all day.

2646
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,000
And then another big thing that I do want to give a quick call out.

2647
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:42,000
In the coming days you guys are actually going to hear about another cool partnership we're doing with Discord which will offer up another opportunity for some cool in-game stuff.

2648
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:45,000
And we'll be talking about that here in the coming days.

2649
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:50,000
But thank you guys again for tuning in to our pre-launch stream.

2650
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Lots of stuff to check out in the patch notes immediately after the stream.

2651
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:58,000
And again, a huge thanks to everyone here.

2652
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:01,000
We will see you guys October 8th in Nahantu.

2653
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:05,000
We're excited and we can't wait to jump into Vessel of Hatred.

2654
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:06,000
We'll see you guys.
