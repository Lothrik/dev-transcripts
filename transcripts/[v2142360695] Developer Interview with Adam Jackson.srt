00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
MUSIC

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, my God.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, my God.

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, my God.

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, my God.

7
00:02:34,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, my God.

8
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, my God.

9
00:03:34,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, my God.

10
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, my God.

11
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
See how nice it is out there?

12
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Look at that.

13
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's like, uh, it's like green and shit.

14
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It looks like a real life out there.

15
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I can feel the breeze coming in.

16
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We're gonna ignore all of it and play video games.

17
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't get cocky, kid.

18
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't get cocky, kid.

19
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't get cocky, kid.

20
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Where's the wave?

21
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There he comes.

22
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There he comes.

23
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's all over the goddamn...

24
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Cheers, dir a bit, or that we're gonna do...

25
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, my God.

26
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah.

27
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And let's go.

28
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm you bitch.

29
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And let's go.

30
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm you Albert.

31
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm you?

32
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What?

33
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm out.

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm you?

35
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
марätze� mine.

36
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not.

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm...

38
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you.

39
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hello, everybody. Welcome to Stream Today.

40
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Obviously, you guys are here because today is going to be the Diablo 4 interview with Blizzard's own Adam Jackson.

41
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We spent yesterday going through both Riker and Rax's questions.

42
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So we're not going to be double dipping and doing the same ones that they did yesterday because they've already been answered.

43
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So shout out to Rax for sending over some of his leftover questions. Riker with the same.

44
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And then my co-host, Ghazi, and me spent this morning kind of going through and retuning some of the questions as well.

45
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We also have a rapid fire section.

46
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It is a whole bunch of questions that we have seen repeatedly be brought up by basically the chat and people that leave comments, etc.

47
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So we're going to try to get through all of the questions today.

48
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know it's a rather short interview.

49
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So for the people that aren't aware of what's going on, I'm just going to give you a quick filler on what exactly is going on.

50
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So they are doing sort of their first round of interviews.

51
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If you haven't seen any of the other ones, Blizzard has started going on to fellow content creators' channels to do live interviews in which you can ask questions primarily about Season 4.

52
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But be in Diablo and Jim Rowe philosophy behind design principles and some specific questions as well.

53
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The interview starts at 1 p.m. PST, which is in approximately one hour forum now.

54
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We do have a pretty decent amount of questions in the rapid fire section.

55
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But if there is anything in particular you guys really want to see, and it's a good question, then me and my co-host Ghazi, who will join us shortly before the start of the podcast or interview, I suppose this one is.

56
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is more of an interview than a podcast.

57
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We're not really going to be having as many conversations as much as us asking questions.

58
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I see people saying the mic needs to go up.

59
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can boost it slightly for you guys.

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's easy enough.

61
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can feel free to leave them in the chat, and if we see a whole bunch of those, then we will do our best to get them added in as well.

62
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How's the audio levels on my end of things?

63
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's make sure that we have audio levels are fine and all that to start.

64
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Go ahead and put them both chats.

65
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I do have both chats open, both YouTube and Twitch.

66
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So are we good?

67
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How's the quality?

68
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Everyone can see everything.

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You guys are able to hear the intro, so therefore the audio is working.

70
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Everything sound good on your guys' end of it?

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Great audio, thanks.

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Peaking.

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hello, sharp.

74
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

75
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can fix that.

76
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That should fix that a little bit there.

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Remove the threshold a bit.

78
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Continuation.

79
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How is that?

80
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Does that work a little bit better for you guys?

81
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Should be slightly better there.

82
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ask what we have to load every player's stash items.

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm going to try to stick to questions that are going to provide useful bits of information or things that could potentially come to the game.

84
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We're not really going to ask a lot of questions that don't really do anything for the player base at the moment, if that makes sense.

85
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So we're not going to ask, like, when do we get another stash tab?

86
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Questions like that are pretty much going to be avoided.

87
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And we're going to be trying to ask more like, hey, what is either the development process behind this or what is the potential for updates related to this, etc.?

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I won't spoil all the questions that we're going to have.

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But we're going to try to avoid useless questions as much as possible, basically.

90
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
As some of them can not be so useful.

91
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
With that being said, for the people that saw Riker and Rax's interview, you guys like the interviews?

92
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I watched both of them.

93
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
They've seen pretty good interviews.

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Looks like Riker gave us more of like design philosophy.

95
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Rax kind of had more particulars about, you know, gameplay type of stuff, it seemed like.

96
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How am I doing?

97
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm doing pretty good.

98
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Not live on Twitch today.

99
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We are live on both platforms.

100
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
YouTube as well.

101
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So you could be able to see both of them.

102
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
In one hour, five minutes from now.

103
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Correct.

104
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Do they plan on adding raids or raid mechanics to bosses?

105
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So this is one that has kind of come up significantly.

106
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And we do actually have raids in the rapid fire portion.

107
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So towards the end of this, what we're going to attempt to do is shoot off a whole bunch of these.

108
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I mean, I think we have like 15 to 20 questions.

109
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We have like six major questions we're going to try to get answered, which were our primary ones.

110
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And then we have a rapid fire, which is like everything from like PvP, solo cell found, raids, map overlays, you know, filters.

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Like all of the questions that people are consistently spam asking over and over again.

112
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We do have that under the rapid fire portion.

113
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So if there are some of your questions that you guys are curious about seeing that you haven't seen in some of the others,

114
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
if we can have enough time and get to the rapid fire portion,

115
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
more than likely one of your common questions will be in that rapid fire portion.

116
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, it is in one hour.

117
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Correct.

118
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Shout out to Woody's in the chat.

119
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Wednesday interview.

120
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah.

121
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
One hour, Woody.

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I see some other questions in here talking about skill tree.

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Skill tree was done on the previous interview with Racks,

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
though we do ask some non-skill tree related build questions today.

125
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah.

126
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So like I was saying, we're not going to be double dipping on questions that were already primarily answered within the other interviews.

127
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We're going to try to only do new things.

128
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We're going third.

129
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We're the last of the interviews, Mingazi.

130
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So because of that, a lot of the questions have already been answered.

131
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So if there is some of these, like to give you an idea, let me pull like a common one, right, that went through previously.

132
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Like asking about the Nightmare Dungeons, Pinnacle Content, or like the Roadmap, for instance.

133
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Those would have been answered in Racks' interview, so we're not going to ask those again.

134
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So if you think like, oh, there seems like to be some major questions that weren't asked, like when is an armory coming?

135
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Like that's probably in the previous interview.

136
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So just check those other interviews.

137
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Shout out to those ones as well.

138
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If you don't see the question that you're super interested in, they might have been in the previous ones, which is why we didn't ask it.

139
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Intro is nice.

140
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, thanks, man.

141
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Shout out to Jim Tindo for putting together the intros.

142
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's my editor.

143
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Can you ask them if they would add black dye?

144
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Someone, we actually do have a question related to some transmog related questions, which are, to be fair, transmogs are at the bottom of the list.

145
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think people care more about gameplay mechanics, etc. than they care about like transmog type of questions.

146
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But we do have one of the questions that came up, the chat was asking, was like a hex wheel or more color chromas, etc. for transmog.

147
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So that's all the way at the bottom of the list.

148
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But if we do get to that time, then we will be asking about, can we get like a color wheel, for instance, around transmog?

149
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So that is actually in the rapid fire portion.

150
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Scale paragon loadouts.

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That would have already been answered in Rex's previous interview, which would have been yesterday.

152
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I'd recommend checking out his interview for that one because they talk about the armory system.

153
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And to just give you a pseudo answer on what the answer on that was is basically, we like that, but we can't talk about it.

154
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

155
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So I don't know if that means it's coming in the expansion or something, but it seems like the potential is there.

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What is their vision for PvP?

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So PvP was a highly debated topic.

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It was very split.

159
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
About half of you guys did not want us to use interview time on PvP-related questions.

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The other half was very much like, hey, I only play the game for PvP.

161
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I understand and acknowledge there's a PvP community within this game that would like answers towards PvP.

162
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So what we did is we added PvP question, like what's the plan around PvP and development of it, to the rapid fire portion.

163
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It didn't get one of the primary slots for the questions because all of the questions, we didn't even ask stuff about classes we want to know.

164
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't have any questions in there around things that I personally wanted to know.

165
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They're all things that can apply to every player regardless of what class you're playing, regardless if you're console or PC, or how you play the game.

166
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We're going for questions that apply to the majority of people.

167
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So I'm not going to ask, like, what's the plan with druid companions?

168
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I would love to know, but that's not in there.

169
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So PvP is one of those questions that has a community that plays it, but is not like the majority of players.

170
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So for that reason, we put that into the rapid fire portion of today.

171
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So if we get into the rapid fire, we will be able to ask, what's the plan with PvP?

172
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And which hopefully we can get a few second response on that.

173
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So for the people that are just joining, it has not started yet.

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It will be.

175
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We have one hour until the interview starts.

176
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We are doing the last prep for it now.

177
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ghazi will join us shortly before the interview.

178
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And then we will have a few moments in which we need to, we'll probably actually go for an audio test about 15 minutes before the hour.

179
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And that way we can make sure we have the audio and everything set up.

180
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It'll be on a holding screen and then we'll pop up the interview and then we'll go from there.

181
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I do see a question related to legendary gems, charms, paladin, Diablo, and Diablo 4.

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Pit leaderboard, runes, and achievements.

183
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So the pit stuff was already covered.

184
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The paladin, etc.

185
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That is related to potentially the expansion, right?

186
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Because there's a new class coming with expansions already been talked about.

187
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So they can't talk about new classes.

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So that one we're not able to cover because they're not talking about expansion information today.

189
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Legendary gems and charms.

190
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We sort of have pseudo-answered in our question or pseudo-asked in the upcoming question.

191
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
One of the questions we will be asking is around further development and progression of characters outside of only the skill tree.

192
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
As the skill tree specifically was answered in the previous interview.

193
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So we are trying to ask about that stuff today as well.

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
PvP is the tried and true in-game for the genre.

195
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Eh, for certain people.

196
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let's see, what else do we have here?

197
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Mercenaries plan or considered?

198
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We do have a question related to pets slash followers in the rapid-fire portion as pets do seem to come up pretty often.

199
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
When does the interview start?

200
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Top of the hour.

201
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Expansion price.

202
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
They're not going to be talking about shop or price-related things today.

203
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Roomwords.

204
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Roomwords were covered in a previous interview with Riker.

205
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So that one has already been discussed.

206
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If we get into the rapid-fire portion, then we can for sure spend a little bit of time trying to dig deeper into that.

207
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But that has been asked.

208
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And keep in mind, this is a very short interview.

209
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This is only 45 minutes is what we have available to us.

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So because of the 45 minutes that we have available, we have to ask as many honed questions as we can and then get into the rapid-fire, which will be a little bit quicker, hopefully.

211
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So we aren't able to get all of the questions today.

212
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So if there's some that people are wanting to see that you don't get, I'm sorry.

213
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
For instance, I see many questions about the cow level.

214
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's in the rapid-fire portion.

215
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But we don't have meme questions in here.

216
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Like I'm not going to ask them, have you heard of the D4Bad radio YouTube?

217
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Like we're not going to ask useless questions.

218
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We're trying to ask mostly things that can apply to most players at most levels, basically.

219
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Or at least try to have the opportunity to have an answer with new information.

220
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That is our primary focus of the day.

221
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And keep in mind, normally, me and Ghazi with these tavern talks, these are podcasts.

222
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Like the one we did with POE, for instance, was almost three hours.

223
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
We don't have that amount of time.

224
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So this is going to be a lot less of give and take of me talking with the person and more so me and Ghazi going back and forth, shooting like, here's my question, here's his question, and then listening to the answers, acknowledging the answers, then hitting again with the next question.

225
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We have six primary questions we would like to get through this evening.

226
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And then after that, we have like over a dozen secondary questions.

227
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
If we get to, we'll be in there to ask specifically about the Cal level, as I'm seeing a million of those.

228
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The Cal level is in the rapid-fire portion, but that's a meme question.

229
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Like no dev has ever even referred to the existence of the Cal level in any Diablo game, as far as I'm aware.

230
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So it's an ongoing joke that if you ask them, they'll be like, I don't know what you're talking about.

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There's no Cal level.

232
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So therefore, it's sort of a useless use of time for the people that are watching this interview today.

233
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So for that reason, we're not really going to spend a lot of time diving into the Cal level.

234
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Group Finder, they didn't really answer Rax about it.

235
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So questions that were asked but not answered in the depth of which the audience would have enjoyed will not be reiterated upon because we've already had the opportunity to see what they would answer that with.

236
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If they didn't have an answer available for Group Finder and I ask them again literally the day after the same person who was just asked about Group Finder, he's going to give us the same answer.

237
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Nothing has changed within 24 hours of his previous answer.

238
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It would be a misuse of our opportunity of time here.

239
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So for that reason, like I've mentioned previously, questions such as Group Finder in which we didn't get a satisfactory answer to your liking will not be re-asked as we already know how they would choose to answer it.

240
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Any bosses getting quality of life changes for Season 4?

241
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We do have a question related to World Bosses here, which we could dive into a little bit.

242
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Skill Tree Expansion.

243
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
This was covered in Rax's interview, which I would recommend watching from yesterday.

244
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What about the gold level slash puzzle ring slash D3?

245
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We do have that specific question within the rapid fire portion.

246
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes, actually.

247
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Why are all the devs doing interviews with streamers all of a sudden this time?

248
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
They're probably on the promotional run.

249
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If I had to guess, the expansion is coming.

250
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I believe it's coming this year.

251
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And Season 4 is sort of a rework or reborn of the game is the word they're using for it.

252
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
They're hitting up all of the content creators to talk about it.

253
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It would make sense.

254
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
They're also probably trying to communicate better as they do seem to be trying to listen to the feedback.

255
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And one of the feedbacks that the devs have had is that people would like more communication within the game.

256
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So I think it's a two-handed of it's a promotional run, which I don't have any problems doing, being someone who could use the interview, as well as they are trying to go under the feedback that we have been giving them about communicate more to the audience, I think.

257
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's a win-win.

258
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's how I see it anyway.

259
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Bag stash size.

260
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So I addressed this earlier.

261
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We're not going to be talking about stash size today or asking about stash tabs.

262
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is one that is so well-known of an issue that has been talked about and done feedback on and been represented multiple times in multiple live streams so far.

263
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So because of that, it would be a misuse of our time today to talk about stash tabs.

264
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We already know it's a dev technical limitation behind it.

265
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
They've added one new stash tabs.

266
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And more than likely, if I had to guess, the answer to that would be, well, we know we need new stash tabs, but we did just limit the amount of loot being dropped with this new loot reborn system.

267
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We also have the Codex of Power, which is now more quality of life, meaning your items are stored there, meaning there will be less inventory used for you.

268
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So you're kind of pseudo getting more stash space.

269
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That, I assume, would be the answer, which is the same question or the same reason one of our primary questions today will not be about loot filters.

270
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:41,000
They will be in the rapid fire portion if we get there because I do believe we will acquire the same answer from them if we asked about stash stores and loot filter are kind of going to get the same answer.

271
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The same answer would be, well, with loot reborn, there will be a significant reduction in the amount of things you have to store.

272
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And I assume that would be the answer.

273
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Therefore, it would be a misuse of time at the moment.

274
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So we're going to go with other questions.

275
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It is a good question, however, just not for the very limited amount of time we have currently.

276
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay, good.

277
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They addressed loot filters in a video the other day.

278
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,000
True, actually.

279
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Hardcore SSF and other game modes being looked at.

280
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes, I do like that question, Henry.

281
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That is in the rapid fire portion.

282
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It is at the top of the rapid fire portion.

283
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:30,000
My logic behind asking SSF modes is I know it doesn't appeal to everybody, but with trading becoming larger in Diablo 4 now with legendaries being able to be a trader in this season, I do believe SSF has more of a place now than it used to be as people will want that tag.

284
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Therefore, there's a question that we'll try to get to today.

285
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Five dollars from Jordan saying getting Uber mats is so monotonous and I'm mispronouncing that and people buying them is especially an issue.

286
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Just the Uber space in general.

287
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Can we ask them for thoughts on this?

288
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So this was pseudo covered in Rax's previous interview where he talked about the trading in the game, which does include boss material mats as well as RMT and third party sites.

289
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So this was very lightly touched upon in the previous one.

290
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Now, in terms of it being a labor to get Uber mats, we're not going to ask them if they're going to buff the rates or anything like that.

291
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
They seem to be pretty obvious about their intentions related to gathering the Uber mats.

292
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
They now have up to three resplendent sparks, for instance, and they keep increasing the Uber drop rates.

293
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It seems like they already know that feedback.

294
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So instead of hitting them with feedback, they already know in which the answer will be that they'll tell us, OK, well, we've done this and we've done this and this already.

295
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It increased Uber drop rates and the hell tides now drop them and we have them as global drop rates, etc.

296
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's already pseudo answered with their actions.

297
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So more than likely, we're not going to get into that one today.

298
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But I do agree with you for the record, by the way, that I don't like farming the materials either.

299
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So I would agree with you there, Jordan.

300
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
On to the next one.

301
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Detail about the starter set.

302
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I can ask about that in the rapid fire portion.

303
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That was something that was not entirely covered in the previous interviews.

304
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It was one of the questions that Rex wanted to get to, which is the faux sets as Diablo 4 is trending towards Diablo 3.

305
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That is our seventh question.

306
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
If we have time to get there about Diablo 4 trending towards Diablo 3 and some follow ups that Rex wanted to get to, he was not able to.

307
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So if we have enough time for that, then we will be getting to that one as well.

308
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But that's our seventh question in line and is one of the bullet points there on the seventh one.

309
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's see.

310
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
When you ask pets, can you mention mercenaries specifically?

311
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We have a very fast rapid fire question about pets and followers, if we can get there, which is like, okay, pets and followers coming to the game.

312
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

313
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's pretty much like that level of question pretty fast because when we get to the rapid fire portion, there's almost 20 of these questions.

314
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Can you ask if they'll fix trophy achievements that are bugs, specifically the exploiting one?

315
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I can't platinum because of the bug.

316
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
That is interesting.

317
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I haven't heard that one before.

318
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I will add that into the rapid fire portion now.

319
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That sounds like it's specifically a PS5 prom.

320
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Maybe anyone else can confirm they have that same issue.

321
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll add that to the bottom of the rapid fire.

322
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Rumors were partially answered in Riker's interview because we rapid fire a yes-no question for expansion.

323
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I can't ask about – I would love to.

324
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I can't ask about anything about expansions because they can't talk about expansion because they are – they're bottlenecked on being able to talk about it.

325
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Like, they're not allowed to discuss expansion stuff today, basically.

326
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
They don't have the freedom to discuss expansions, so I can't talk about – I can't talk about the expansion, basically, today.

327
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I would love to ask them more about it, but we can't yet.

328
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm sure, if the interviews are going well, that what they will end up doing is doing more of these as time goes on and as we actually get closer, I would assume, towards the expansion itself, in which you could ask about the expansion.

329
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
When is the interview?

330
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
When is the interview?

331
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's the top of the hour.

332
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So, we are – we're getting there.

333
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Actually, a few minutes before the top of the hour, we're going to go into a holding screen so that we can get people in and get the audio balance, etc.

334
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Did they fix snapshotting?

335
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm probably not going to spend too much of the limited time we have talking about – talking about bugs that could be fixed at the moment.

336
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm probably going to attempt to try to get new information as opposed to reporting bugs during this, as that is something that gets sent as feedback very often.

337
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I see on the Twitch side of things, thanks for the Prime subs and the Tier 1 subs.

338
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I appreciate that, boys, and for the people doing membership, etc. on YouTube.

339
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Thank you.

340
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Larger viewing angles.

341
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Well, we just received the camera zoom out.

342
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Seasonal themes should be account-wide.

343
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Okay, so I'm seeing feedback-related questions.

344
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Keep in mind, we're trying to get new information, not send feedback.

345
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Feedback.

346
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
This interview – we can send feedback at any time.

347
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:58,000
All of us creators are in a partner program, so when people send feedback like, hey, can you guys fix this bug, etc., a lot of times we send that instead over to the partner program where they can receive the bug fixes and feedback, etc.

348
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It would be a misuse of time to just report bugs during this interview.

349
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
If you can squeeze a quick PVP question during rapid fire, it would be significant for us.

350
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So I talked about this earlier.

351
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm sure you just showed up.

352
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,000
We are going to have a rapid fire section, and within the rapid fire section, we do specifically ask about PVP for that PVP community.

353
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm not a PVP Andy.

354
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
There's plenty of people that aren't PVP Andys, but there are people that are.

355
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So it's within one of the first, I think, three to four within the rapid fire question, we just ask very simply, are there plans to further develop PVP?

356
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Basically.

357
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I know there's people out there that specifically play the game for PVP.

358
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I know there's people that don't give a rat's ass about PVP.

359
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I understand that.

360
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So I will do my best to make sure that gets fitted in.

361
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
If at a minimum, as the very last question on its way out the door, I'll make sure we get that one fitted in.

362
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Okay.

363
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Thanks for the five, by the way.

364
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Let me pull up some more questions here.

365
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I've been reading from YouTube chat.

366
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Let me read from Twitch chat here.

367
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I wrote Rainbow Goblin Portals again.

368
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We do have that in the rapid fire portion.

369
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We try to ask them if they're going to implement a few stuffed experience in the game, which interact with streamers while streaming the game like Baldur's Gate 3 did.

370
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That's cool, but that's more something that benefits myself personally as opposed to information that people who are all the way from casual to like Omega Blasters would care to hear.

371
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So I'm not going to ask things that are only relevant really to myself being a streamer today.

372
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
This is going to be questions related that the general audience cares about.

373
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So probably won't be asking about streamer benefits.

374
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Is Diablo 4 still a thing or just a meme?

375
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Should I buy it now?

376
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, all right.

377
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't know.

378
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Up to you, bro.

379
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Go look at reviews.

380
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Can you ask if they plan to add raids to the game?

381
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Raids are within the rapid fire portion.

382
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yes.

383
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yo, ruin puzzle with the five tier one gifted.

384
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Thank you, sir.

385
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Very generous.

386
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Have Blizzard considered selling, sharing a map editor on campaign editor?

387
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
More like an in-house mod for D4 or an instance creation that can be shared to other players?

388
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So one of the points that I thought would have been interesting in Season 3 for the Vault

389
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
is instead of it being a vault that we all go do and try to beat, then what it actually

390
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
is is a vault that you create that other players try to beat your trap vault.

391
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Sort of like a mighty quest for epic loot, if you guys ever remember that game, where

392
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
you build a base that other players raid.

393
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I thought that could have been a cool PvP way of doing it, as well as a cool way to have

394
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
something create yourself.

395
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't think that question in particular is actually going to make it into this today.

396
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But I do like where you're going with that one, because I also like things like that that

397
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
allow you to be creative in games.

398
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But I don't think a dungeon editor is going to be very high up on the list of priorities

399
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
for them, if I had to imagine.

400
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That was talked about with Racks for Maps.

401
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I must have missed that one as I watched the interviews.

402
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Can you ask if specializations for every class are going to be improved upon?

403
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
He is the class lead designer today.

404
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We do have some class related questions towards the end of it.

405
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Asking them if the classes are basically going to become better isn't necessarily a great way

406
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
to phrase that question.

407
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So we might not ask it in the words that you're asking here today.

408
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But we we are asking what their next focus typically is on in relation to like class fantasy,

409
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
for instance, which might be a way of getting close to your specialization.

410
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Ask about making sets as sets as set gems, not items.

411
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So we don't ask about set items in particular, but we do actually talk about

412
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
progression related to things outside of only the skill tree,

413
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
one of which basically being like gems, etc.

414
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Or in this game would be more referred to as glyphs.

415
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Adam specifically said in Rex's interview that questions that was the next priority are better than

416
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
will you do this?

417
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Yes.

418
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So part of our focus and our prep for the interview has been as much about wording it in a way that

419
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
somebody is allowed to speak on as much as preparing for what questions are important.

420
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Like we're trying to the wording of these questions have to be making it where he can talk about it.

421
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I can't just ask him, hey, in the expansion is the paladin coming.

422
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Like you just can't say things like that.

423
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We will get non answers.

424
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So we are doing our best to have our list of questions be things that make it easy for him to have a good conversation on the interview

425
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
as opposed to locking him down and putting him defensively.

426
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Trying to make it like a good interview here.

427
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Or at least attempting to.

428
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Thoughts on giving all classes equipment slot parity?

429
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I don't think that's going to work as a barbarian, right?

430
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You mind asking about trade board slash market?

431
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Would enable community engagement?

432
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Appreciate the 10.

433
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
That is something that came up in the previous interview with Rax.

434
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I do believe they said they're not going to do an auction house if I'm remembering correctly.

435
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And we're not going to double dip into the same questions that were already previously asked.

436
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So while I like that question, I also do believe that trading, I even made a video talking about how trading is going to be significantly different going into season four.

437
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That is something that has sort of already been covered.

438
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And I would be reiterating upon a question that's already been covered.

439
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Can you ask for the final temporary manuals?

440
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yes.

441
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Actually, that is one of our questions is related to clarity of temporary manual changes, etc.

442
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The first question should be, why did such an awesome person like you join D4?

443
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That's a good one.

444
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm sure he would love that question.

445
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, thanks for the subs.

446
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I see that.

447
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
A little fly high with the five tier ones.

448
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Thanks, buddy.

449
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Appreciate it on the Twitch side of things with the hype train going on.

450
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Are we going to add new Uber Uniques or update existing ones?

451
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So we're not asking, are you going to have new Uber Uniques?

452
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Because they've already been adding new Uber Uniques.

453
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And so we can determine by previous information that they're going to continue to add Uber Uniques.

454
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It would be sort of a throwaway question.

455
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Because we know that they'll be adding more.

456
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
They have been.

457
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Can you ask him if I could hold the dollar?

458
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
There's some really interesting questions in here.

459
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I feel like I'm getting trolled with some of these questions.

460
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
If I have a dollar for every Cal level question I'm getting.

461
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Can you ask if all PvE will be PvP?

462
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I don't even know what that means.

463
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I don't know if anyone in here knows what that means.

464
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'll be honest.

465
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Pineapple on pizza, yes?

466
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,000
No.

467
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,000
No for me.

468
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Can you ask if we'll be able to craft an Uber Unique?

469
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So that is already in the game.

470
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,000
As a matter of fact.

471
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You can get three Resplendent Sparks.

472
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And you have to get a drop of the fourth one to get the fourth spark.

473
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Which will allow you to craft a total Uber Unique of whatever you want.

474
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
That being said.

475
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
One of the rapid fire questions was.

476
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Are they ever going to add a fourth spark?

477
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Or is the design philosophy about making it where you have to get a drop before you can pick the drop basically.

478
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Or if they would ever allow deterministic crafting of Uber Uniques.

479
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Shop prices and plans for singular armor cosmetics for sale.

480
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So both between the expansions as well as the shop are two things you're not going to address today.

481
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Rax A was going to coordinate with you with questions he wasn't able to get to.

482
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Are you going to be asking any of those?

483
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yes.

484
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
We have plenty of questions from Rax's pamphlet that he was not able to get through today.

485
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Shout out to Rax for being generous enough to pass along the torch and some questions.

486
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That did help significantly today with prep.

487
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Ask them if they're up for an AMA on Reddit.

488
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I don't think that's an important question.

489
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I think that's an interesting one.

490
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I like that question.

491
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But I don't think that's an important use of time.

492
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
If I had two hours here with Ghazi where we could go back and forth and do a podcast, it's different.

493
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
This isn't our normal interview.

494
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
We've done lots of interviews with POE and Last Epoch devs.

495
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We've done plenty of these.

496
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But in all of those, we had two to three hours.

497
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
This is 45 minutes.

498
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So this isn't going to be so much a conversation or a use of everything I want to know as much as like,

499
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
what can we cram in to this 45 minutes?

500
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
If you've seen the previous interviews, you know they are short.

501
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So we're doing what we can to the priority for it.

502
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Now put priority for questions.

503
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Seems you have too many.

504
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
We only have six that are high priority.

505
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The rest are rapid fire.

506
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah.

507
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So we have actually put them in the priority list, assuming that we don't get through all of them.

508
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
We did that this morning.

509
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Thank you for the sub, sir.

510
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I need you to ask a simple question about clans, please.

511
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It doesn't need a complete rework.

512
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Always a status.

513
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
How long is so-and-so flying?

514
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
We can manage the clan.

515
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Yeah.

516
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I did see that question actually yesterday, as a matter of fact.

517
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
During breakfast interview, people were asking about that in the chat.

518
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So I will actually put that in the rapid fire portion for you, Hogg.

519
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And I'll put it in the top five of the rapid fire for you.

520
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Sure.

521
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Did you pass those six questions to Adam already?

522
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yeah.

523
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
We pretty much said, hey, here's your prep.

524
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Like, these are the questions we're going to ask.

525
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And we haven't changed or removed any of them other than the charms question, because charms

526
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
are just something that is not able really to be spoken, spoken, speaking, spoked upon.

527
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So things that are a useless waste of time that he can't talk about have been removed,

528
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and we only have one of those, which is basically charms.

529
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Other than that, everything's remained the same.

530
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
DM, can you begin streaming on YouTube?

531
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Streaming on YouTube right now, my friend.

532
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Thank you very much.

533
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Five dollars from Throck.

534
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
No question.

535
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Thank you, Throck.

536
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Can you please ask if they address concerns over store pricing?

537
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So I just brought this up.

538
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Store pricing expansions are things that won't be brought up today due to the fact that it's

539
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
things that people cannot speak on.

540
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So we're only asking things that we can actually get answers on.

541
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
We're not asking any questions that the devs will basically say, well, we can't talk about

542
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
that right now.

543
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We're trying to avoid situations where we basically box them into a corner with five questions

544
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
in a row where he's like, I can't talk about that.

545
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't want to get fired.

546
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I can't talk about that.

547
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like we're trying not to waste time with questions that we know can't be answered already.

548
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So these questions are going to be things that we can either get design intent behind,

549
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
or we can get intent to develop, or things that he could potentially actually talk about.

550
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
We're trying to not put them in the corner.

551
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Plus, if you look in the previous interview, we're interviewing Adam Jackson today.

552
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And one of the things I respected was in the previous interview, he stated that he does

553
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
not talk about or promise things that he knows he can't follow through on.

554
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And so I'm only going to ask him stuff that we can actually get an answer on, basically.

555
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And if there's some of the things he can't talk about, then so be it.

556
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And he's going to say that he can't talk about it.

557
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
We are trying a few of these that we're hoping he can talk about.

558
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But they are things that haven't been asked about before, and that should promote conversation.

559
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
We're doing our best here.

560
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
We watched all of the previous interviews.

561
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And to be honest, I respect the not wanting to do false promises.

562
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Plus, it's one guy up there.

563
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
He's got a whole team behind him.

564
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
If he goes up and promises like, yes, charms are coming next week, then he's setting the

565
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
entire team up for a promise that he might potentially not be able to fulfill on.

566
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And then it opens up to them to, okay, well, you said it was coming, but now it's not coming.

567
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Blizzard, once again, is failing on their promises.

568
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's too hard for somebody who's being interviewed to be able to commit that heavily as a singular

569
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
person who's not like the actual CEO here.

570
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So he's a class designer.

571
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So we're trying to ask questions that are relative to his job and things he can talk about.

572
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Pretty much that simple.

573
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Did the interview happen already?

574
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
No, it will be happening shortly.

575
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It starts in 30 minutes and about 15 will go to audio testing.

576
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm posting on Twitter real quick for the people that follow there so that they know

577
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,000
it's about to start.

578
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Any questions regarding Paragon boards?

579
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
You will be happy to hear that the first question is about Paragon.

580
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Thank you for the 279, Paulo.

581
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
No question.

582
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Here it says message retracted.

583
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Can you ask if there are plans to add glyph leveling outside of nightmares?

584
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I do like that question.

585
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'll add that to the rapid fire, actually.

586
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'll put that one in there.

587
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
See if we can get to that one.

588
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Love the Hawaii tan.

589
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I didn't tan in Hawaii as much as I burned, if we're being honest.

590
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Please ask about boss rotations group to get 4x to the solo player.

591
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You know, weren't this already addressed in the previous one?

592
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I think people talked about the balance around the 4x and 1x Uber Duryal farming.

593
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I think this was a question that's already been spoke upon, if I remember.

594
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So that one is not in our questions today.

595
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Like I say, we are trying to stick to questions that have not been addressed.

596
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Even if they're pseudo answers.

597
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
You're completely healed?

598
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It is actually now, yeah.

599
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I was glad to hear, get it, glad to hear, that I did not have a loss of hearing.

600
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I went to the ear doc.

601
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Can you ask the dev how to bring back the D2 experience, building your character in a unique way,

602
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
and now again looking at the character in order to complete the pit?

603
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
So we have a question related to progression of characters outside of the skill tree,

604
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
because the skill tree portion has been answered.

605
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So we're pseudo getting to that question.

606
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Ask them about Golem Mastery on equipment.

607
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You will be happy to hear that is in today's questions.

608
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I believe it's actually the second or third one.

609
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
That specifically about the Golem Mastery is actually in there.

610
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
What's their approach to balance between casuals and no lifers like us?

611
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I like that question.

612
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
That one is something, because that I actually had previously in the list,

613
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
which was about target demographic and who the game's designed for,

614
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
is something I would love to hear more on.

615
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I ended up cutting that one.

616
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And the reason I cut it is because it wasn't something I think everyone cares about,

617
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
which is, that is more of a business philosophy,

618
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
which is, hey, we're trying to acquire this audience or this audience,

619
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and I don't think people care about that as much as what the game has in store.

620
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So we cut that one in lieu of focusing more on, like,

621
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
what do you guys plan to do or developing thoughts around things for the game

622
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
as opposed to thoughts around business practices.

623
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So we do have that one as a backup question,

624
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
because I personally find the philosophy stuff more interesting

625
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
than I find, like, the game balance stuff, just personally.

626
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But we're not going with what I personally find more interesting today.

627
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
When is it starting?

628
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Shortly.

629
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
In about 15 minutes, we're going to go to audio test.

630
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It starts at the top of the hour here.

631
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
That's the most important question.

632
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I think it's an important question as well,

633
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
but for the reasons stated is why that one is moved to a lower portion of the list,

634
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
just to answer you.

635
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Let me look at some YouTube chat.

636
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Let me move over to the Twitch chat here for a moment.

637
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Thanks for the sub, buddy.

638
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Ask if they ever tend to revamp Paragon boards.

639
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Pretty much the first question.

640
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Can you ask if I can get an interview, too?

641
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I got 64 followers.

642
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Only, like, half of them are bots.

643
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
No problem, buddy.

644
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I got you.

645
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Can we have a DPS meter on target dummies?

646
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That's a pretty cool one.

647
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I think I remember that one being asked before,

648
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
but I'm going to add it into the rapid fire.

649
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Okay.

650
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
What about clan banks, mailboxes, etc.?

651
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I believe expansion upon the clan system was something that was covered previously.

652
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I don't think, in particular, like, clan banks are something that's been addressed.

653
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
That's not in the questions today,

654
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,000
but we do have the offline question related to clans in here,

655
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
so we have one clan-related question for the rapid fire portion.

656
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
What about the new horse?

657
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Actually, one of the questions for rapid fire is,

658
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
what do you think about doing mounts that, like, aren't horses?

659
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You know, like a maggot from maggot lair.

660
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Please ask about strongholds, a new mechanic about it.

661
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Strongholds are in the questions today.

662
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Can you ask about making side quest rewards on par with other activities?

663
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That's an interesting one.

664
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
We didn't get to that one, though.

665
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I don't think that's going to make the list today, but I like that question.

666
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Ask them in the rapid fire portion.

667
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Is there going to be a more detailed combat log?

668
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Okay.

669
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We might be able to get to that one.

670
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I don't know.

671
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Our rapid fire portion is filling up pretty quickly here.

672
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Does your Tinder profile say skinny hippie viking?

673
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I'm going to try hard not to say a your mom joke.

674
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
You know, ask your mom.

675
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I tried.

676
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I couldn't do it.

677
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Can you talk about how group play is discouraged in the pit?

678
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I see this question coming up all the time.

679
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I think, like, the group play versus solo player thing

680
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
is very, very, very much, like, talked about already.

681
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I think they even addressed this in the previous interview,

682
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
like, the one literally from yesterday, if I remember right.

683
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Can you ask them efficiency regarding group versus solo?

684
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Yeah, I see, like, this question is getting every 15 seconds.

685
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that one was already addressed,

686
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
and they had to kind of pseudo answer it.

687
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Are you going to be as interrupting as Rax was invited to yesterday but didn't?

688
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I mean, I'm not going to, if he's talking about something,

689
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I'm not going to interrupt him to be like,

690
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
hey, can you explain to me, like, you're just as an example,

691
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
this is one of them.

692
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Can you explain to me why druid companions are the way they are or something?

693
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And he starts talking about it, and I'd be like,

694
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
hey, that was great, but that's your time.

695
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Can you explain to me DPS meters on dummies?

696
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Like, I'm not going to do that.

697
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
He's on an interview, and Adam, in my opinion, from what I saw,

698
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
doesn't ramble a whole lot.

699
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
He pretty much talks about it.

700
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And we have six major questions.

701
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
We've only honed it down to a smaller amount of major questions.

702
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:29,000
What about a question regarding a season with more in-depth crafting mechanics?

703
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
That's very open-ended, like, hey, are you guys going to do a season

704
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
where you do even more crafting?

705
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The answer will be, what do you think the answer will be?

706
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You think he's going to say, yes, season six, actually, we have this new mechanic.

707
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Let me spoil it for you.

708
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Like, what he's going to say if I ask that type of question is he's just going to be like,

709
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
maybe, or we'll see.

710
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Like, that's all we would get out of that.

711
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So I actually agree with someone in chat that says,

712
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
ask the right type of questions, you get the right type of answers.

713
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
We're trying to put the majority of the work on things we can control,

714
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
which is the way that we phrase and ask our questions,

715
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and the questions we choose to ask.

716
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So we're not going to ask a whole bunch of stuff that we can't do anything with.

717
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We're trying very hard to ask good questions

718
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
because we have a very limited amount of them.

719
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We think we're going to get maybe six questions from what we can tell.

720
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
The interview starts shortly.

721
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
We're going to be bringing the co-hosting Ghazi TV here shortly.

722
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yes, team eye is 25 minutes.

723
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Can you ask for more body types for each class?

724
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The answer to that, I guarantee you the answer to that,

725
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
will be that if I ask about that,

726
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
then he's going to say that animations would have to be retooled

727
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
for every single different body type,

728
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
and that's a ton of work, so it will be low on the priority list

729
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
because, you know, maybe I want to play a skinny druid.

730
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I get that.

731
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
But then they're going to have to retool animations for all of them,

732
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
and I think they probably have other priorities at the moment.

733
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Please, I'm begging you, give ideas to Blizzard.

734
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't think Blizzard needs to hear in the 45 minutes,

735
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
like, my ideas for their game.

736
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I think what we want to hear is their ideas for their own game

737
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
because that's what you guys care about.

738
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I don't think the people that are watching

739
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
want to hear me develop their game for them in a 45-minute interview.

740
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So more than likely, I'm not going to be like,

741
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
here's what I think you should do

742
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
because I can just do that in a video.

743
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I can do that in the feedback if I wanted to

744
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
in the Diablo Partner Program Discord.

745
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I could just send information.

746
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So we're going to be focusing more on

747
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Blizzard's answer in Blizzard's interview.

748
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Any future plans for world bosses?

749
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That is actually one of our questions on the list

750
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
that made the top priority.

751
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yes, it is something that strongholds and world bosses

752
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
are something we very much would like to know

753
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
about the philosophy behind,

754
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and that is on our list today.

755
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Thoughts on additional cosmetics like weapon glows, etc.

756
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
We have a couple minor cosmetic questions as well.

757
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Okay, so let's poke Ghazi in here

758
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and let's start prepping for the interview here.

759
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I'm going to call my co-host.

760
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
We're going to get him in here.

761
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
We're going to start setting up the overlay

762
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
and what have you.

763
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Here we go.

764
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Ring, ring, banana phone.

765
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Are we going to do the mic soundcheck in Zoom instead?

766
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah, we probably need to join the Zoom, right?

767
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Yes.

768
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Let's see.

769
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
There's a link in there.

770
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Okay, let's go ahead and hop in the Zoom.

771
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Start getting set up here.

772
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Okay.

773
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Let's go ahead and hop in the Zoom.

774
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I'm going to put the questions off to the side

775
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
so I can see them easily.

776
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
The interview is about to start, boys,

777
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
so we are now getting ready.

778
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:07,000
In AOZ, we have in-game content that's scaled indefinitely

779
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
but not really with Pit having a similar line of thought.

780
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Could we have a mechanic, i.e. a glyph,

781
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
that could scale like that too?

782
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That's an interesting one.

783
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I'll see if I can add that to the rapid fire portion

784
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
if we end up having time

785
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
because we do have not infinitely scaling

786
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
but the Pit is literally harder than AOZ.

787
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Now, I believe it's Pit 150 scales

788
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
to what AOZ 25 was before.

789
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So we actually have harder content now than we did before.

790
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Okay, so the live stream interview is about to start here.

791
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I'm going to join the Zoom.

792
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
He'll be able to join for audio testing

793
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
in about five minutes, it sounds like.

794
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
So we're getting really close to the interview

795
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
starting here, boys.

796
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Okay, I'm going to join the Zoom now, Ghazi.

797
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Okay, let's see how this works.

798
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Let's drop out Discord.

799
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Okay, can you hear me, Ghazi?

800
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I can, indeed.

801
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Okay.

802
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
How do I adjust your volume?

803
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Yeah, we need to adjust volumes.

804
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
At the last minute here,

805
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
we're kind of moving from Discord to Zoom.

806
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So we're trying to get the audio and stuff set up here.

807
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Can you just start talking a little bit, please?

808
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yes.

809
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
How do I adjust the volume that I'm hearing from you?

810
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
That's what I'm currently figuring out here as well.

811
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I don't really use Zoom.

812
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Am I too loud or too low?

813
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Maybe.

814
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
How's Ghazi sound?

815
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Do you guys hear it?

816
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Mic check.

817
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Mic check.

818
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
One, two, three.

819
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Mic check.

820
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Too low.

821
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You are too low.

822
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So I need to adjust you higher.

823
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Okay, maybe participants.

824
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Too low.

825
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Okay, yeah, definitely low.

826
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Let me see what I can do about that here.

827
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't find any menus, so.

828
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Yeah, that's what I'm looking at, too.

829
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I don't use Zoom here.

830
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I thought we were going to use Discord, so.

831
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Let me adjust here.

832
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Okay, so there's settings.

833
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Okay.

834
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Okay.

835
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Sounds good.

836
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Compared to DM, he's way too low.

837
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Okay.

838
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah, let me see what I can do here.

839
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay, can you try talking one more time here?

840
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Mic check.

841
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Mic check.

842
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,000
One, two, three.

843
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
One, two, three.

844
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Okay.

845
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Did you just alter the app sound?

846
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Or do you find it?

847
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I OBSed it.

848
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Okay.

849
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Better.

850
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Sounds good.

851
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Good.

852
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Okay, so that will do it for.

853
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Could be louder.

854
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,000
A bit better.

855
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Okay, we'll just get everyone balanced.

856
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
We'll have to take a couple minutes to balance everyone's audio before we get rolling here.

857
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Need more loud?

858
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Can't find a way to adjust your volume.

859
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Yeah, I know.

860
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I'm working on it, too.

861
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:22,000
There's no individual volume slider for.

862
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,000
There is not.

863
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Adam just responded.

864
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I'd recommend my OBS or Windows level.

865
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I'll just fix it on my headset.

866
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I'll be fine.

867
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Okay.

868
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Working on it.

869
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I mean, I guess we have to balance so that our sounds are equal when we're more people, though.

870
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yeah, we'll have to balance each individual one here.

871
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah, I have Zoom meeting all the way maxed out on the Windows and on OBS slider.

872
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So I can add more gain to it.

873
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I can boost the audio levels, too, in OBS if necessary.

874
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,000
But we'll have to...

875
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I can up my volume on the mic a little bit.

876
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yeah, we'll have to change all of our individual mic levels to level it out instead of doing it in-app, then.

877
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Yep.

878
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
So that'll be the way we'll have to do it.

879
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I can lower mine a little bit, too.

880
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
People are saying them a little bit louder.

881
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
As long as you can hear him, then we'll be all right.

882
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And once he gets in here, we'll see what his audio level is like, and we should be able to balance it that way.

883
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I have like 10%, 15% before I cap out on the interface, like an increase.

884
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I think...

885
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Okay, so in both chats, both Twitch and YouTube, I'm trusting your guys' feedback.

886
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Please give me a W if he sounds fine, and we don't need to adjust anything for Ghazi.

887
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Please do an L if it's way too low, way too high, like there's a problem.

888
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
If it sounds fine, don't troll us because the interview is about to start.

889
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
We need accurate feedback here.

890
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Mic check.

891
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Mic check.

892
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,000
One, two, three.

893
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
One, two, three.

894
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Mic check.

895
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Okay, I'm seeing both chats are responding.

896
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Resounding W.

897
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Thank you very much.

898
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Couple Ls for people.

899
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Mostly Ws.

900
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Should be louder.

901
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
That shit's low.

902
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Now I'm seeing a lot of Ls.

903
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Keep talking.

904
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Keep talking.

905
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Keep talking.

906
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
All right.

907
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Do you want me to adjust the volume or just leave it as this?

908
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I literally cannot adjust you any higher.

909
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It is physically impossible within Zoom, so you'll need to adjust your microphone.

910
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I have maxed it.

911
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I hope it's not too loud now.

912
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Okay.

913
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
This is maxed out.

914
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Mic check.

915
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Mic check.

916
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
One, two, three.

917
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Mic check.

918
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Mic check.

919
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Mic check.

920
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
That sounds better on my end.

921
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And I guess we'll just have to do the classic Joe Rogan fist from your face with the microphone.

922
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Speak into the mic directly.

923
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Oh, yeah.

924
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
That's the position I'm in.

925
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Okay.

926
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Perfect.

927
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Okay.

928
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Now I'm seeing everyone saying that's significantly better.

929
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
That's as good as it's going to get.

930
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Okay.

931
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So that sounds fine.

932
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
So now we'll just, once Adam arrives here, then we'll get that going.

933
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,000
We need to get also the, I'll have to get the layout set up here for the podcast.

934
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Once he joins, then I can, I can cut it out.

935
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Okay.

936
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Zoom conference.

937
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I'm getting this set up now.

938
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Okay.

939
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Okay.

940
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That's the Zoom.

941
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
That's the questions.

942
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
We might end up having to bell on the podcast.

943
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Nice little overlay and do it differently because it looks like Zoom is one of those ones that

944
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
does not allow capturing.

945
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Really?

946
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Yeah.

947
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You can't window capture, at least not that I can see.

948
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
What server are we connected to?

949
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
What server are we connected to?

950
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
We're Zoom.

951
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm guessing we're in one of the East Coast servers, right?

952
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I do not know.

953
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
By the way, the interview starts, and for people wondering, it starts in 15 minutes.

954
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:14,000
We will be starting in 15 minutes, but we're just doing the setup process right now.

955
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
That's why we're sitting here, messing around with settings, et cetera, trying to get all

956
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
of the setup properly.

957
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Okay.

958
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Let me see if I can use, I could probably use display capture duplicates then.

959
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
That's a good old-fashioned way to do it.

960
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
The ghetto way, my friend.

961
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah, the absolute ghetto dog way.

962
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Well, I've done that way too many times.

963
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
You got to love it.

964
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah, it's one of those.

965
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Okay.

966
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
We're going to go with multi-window capture here, or multi-display capture to get it up.

967
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I believe mercenaries is, no, our pets was about non-combat pets, right?

968
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
In the rapid fire?

969
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah, so like both cosmetic pets, basically, as well as the follower ones.

970
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
We can do one and two.

971
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yeah.

972
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,000
All right.

973
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So whilst you do that, SR-Axi, the problem with asking that question is, like Dean was

974
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
talking about earlier before I came in, is that they can't tell us what they're going

975
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
to potentially or going to introduce to the game.

976
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So they might just, the answer will either be they can't talk about it, or it sounds like

977
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
a good idea, but we can't talk about it.

978
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Okay.

979
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
You need anything for me for the setup, or you're good with everything?

980
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Well, at the moment, I'm stuck waiting on when he joins, because once he joins, then

981
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I can get it visually set in the positions.

982
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Roger.

983
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
But we're in the two-person layout right now, so until we have the three-person layout,

984
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I can't adjust any of the visuals.

985
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
A little low.

986
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
We're pretty much, I think we're going to keep Ghazi at the level he's at.

987
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
This is about as loud as we're able to get him currently.

988
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I mean, I can ramp it up on the compressor, but you know that has consequences.

989
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Yeah, I think you sound about as loud as I've ever heard you right now for me.

990
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,000
All right.

991
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Okay.

992
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I'm going to...

993
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So what we're going to do in order to make the ads not hit during the interview here,

994
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I'm going to disable ads on YouTube.

995
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Okay.

996
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I'm going to...

997
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I'm going to spam them up on Twitch.

998
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yep.

999
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I'm just going to disable ads on it here, put them to the lowest I can, which is conservative.

1000
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Let me see if I can do it.

1001
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Can I go all the way off with them?

1002
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
There's this new thing that Twitch viewers can do.

1003
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
It's pretty cool.

1004
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
It doesn't cost them anything either.

1005
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It's called Twitch Prime.

1006
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I know you guys have some.

1007
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Just pop them.

1008
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Okay.

1009
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So there should be...

1010
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I believe I was able to fully disable...

1011
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I hope that doesn't affect the things since I'm changing settings right now.

1012
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But I took monetization off entirely on the YouTube ads for YouTube.

1013
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So you guys should just have like no ads at all.

1014
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And let me...

1015
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
In order to stop ads from occurring during the interview, we're going to have to...

1016
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Let's see.

1017
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
There's one running already now, so I can't hit the button.

1018
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
We have to run like the ad now to make it where it gets delayed for a while during the interview.

1019
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
So I have my snoozes, which can snooze another 15 minutes plus the 15-minute gap.

1020
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I'm going to try to get it where it'll go the full hour with no ads.

1021
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So we'll get that set up too.

1022
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And then once he joins, we'll get his visual set up.

1023
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And then that should be everything.

1024
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
We're pretty much good to go with the interview.

1025
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Did I miss anything?

1026
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Feels like it hasn't started.

1027
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,000
That's because it hasn't.

1028
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
It starts in like 10 minutes approximately.

1029
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Give or take a few minutes while we're getting everything set up.

1030
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Okay.

1031
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
For the people on Twitch, if I'm unable to get the ads to stop by running them early...

1032
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Because right now I have 26 minutes of no ads and I can add another 15.

1033
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So I got 41 minutes of no ads.

1034
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
The back like 10 minutes or something might hit you with a one-minute ad.

1035
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I'm trying to get those delays as much as possible.

1036
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
YouTube will have zero ads right now.

1037
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I have it completely disabled.

1038
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Are you nervous?

1039
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Eh.

1040
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Not really.

1041
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I mean, it's like asking like six questions.

1042
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I hope you guys like the questions we have.

1043
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
At this point, we're just going to be reading off the questions we have on the list.

1044
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,000
We did our best to make sure that they are like good questions and stuff that hasn't been asked already.

1045
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
We'll do our best.

1046
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But in terms of nervous...

1047
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I was more nervous for the Path of Exile ones, to be quite honest with you.

1048
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Because I never talked to those dudes.

1049
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Probably the POE ones were nervous.

1050
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Maybe the last EPOC one, because I didn't know the last EPOC very well when we did the interview.

1051
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Oh, but I mean, me coming off as a royal ass probably helped.

1052
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I don't think...

1053
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
You talk about that more than other people talk about that.

1054
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I think you're overhyping.

1055
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
It's really not that big of a deal.

1056
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I know.

1057
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I was a little bit embarrassed.

1058
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I was like, shit.

1059
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I didn't even realize it.

1060
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
But no, I talked to them quite a lot, but they liked it.

1061
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
We're going to have more when the witch reveal comes around.

1062
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It's going to be fun.

1063
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
All right.

1064
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So let me just see here.

1065
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Okay.

1066
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So everything's set up as much as I can get it set up currently.

1067
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Oh, there's our boy.

1068
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Okay, guys.

1069
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I'm going to put a real quick BRB screen here while we are getting things set up.

1070
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Because we're going to do some audio tests and stuff on our end here.

1071
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And get the layout all set up.

1072
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
The boy's here now.

1073
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So give us a few moments.

1074
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And we will be right back with the interview.

1075
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Bye.

1076
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Bye.

1077
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Bye.

1078
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Bye.

1079
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Bye.

1080
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Bye.

1081
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Bye.

1082
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Bye.

1083
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Bye.

1084
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Bye.

1085
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Bye.

1086
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Bye.

1087
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Bye.

1088
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Bye.

1089
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Bye.

1090
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Bye.

1091
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Thank you.

1092
01:06:47,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Thank you.

1093
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Thank you.

1094
01:07:47,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Thank you.

1095
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Thank you.

1096
01:08:47,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Thank you.

1097
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Thank you.

1098
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Hey, I'm doing great.

1099
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
How are you guys doing?

1100
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Doing pretty good.

1101
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Excited.

1102
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
The interview questions are going to start because I know we're a little early.

1103
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
We're about four minutes and it's early.

1104
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
So we're just going to have a couple minute intro while the people row in here.

1105
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It will be starting at exactly 1 p.m. PST.

1106
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But outside of the day, how has the day been for you?

1107
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Very easy icebreaker.

1108
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Very easy icebreaker.

1109
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So we would waste the three minutes before we get going.

1110
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah, totally.

1111
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
It's been wild.

1112
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,000
We've got so much stuff going on between working on season four, more seasons and things coming up in the future.

1113
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Lots of planning, lots of talks.

1114
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
The season's going to be coming out soon.

1115
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I expect a whole lot of feedback and reaction to that.

1116
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
So it's a busy time over here, but pretty exciting as well.

1117
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Nice, man.

1118
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It sounds like you guys are going to have a pretty interesting launch because season four is coming out here very shortly.

1119
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And I think itemization is going to be the big talk.

1120
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
We do have some questions related to both itemization, what's going to be next, et cetera, for you to go through here on the list.

1121
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Before we get started, we have to do a quick thing and make sure everyone here can hear the audio just fine.

1122
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Can you hear Ghazi?

1123
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
So Ghazi, can you say a sentence?

1124
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I can say a sentence, absolutely.

1125
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Super excited for the release.

1126
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Minions, that's all I'm saying.

1127
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And Adam, literally anything at all you want to say?

1128
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Yeah, test, test.

1129
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I also am a minion enjoyer, it turns out.

1130
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
So I've heard.

1131
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I'm excited to talk about him.

1132
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Don't get Ghazi star of the minions when we get going, man.

1133
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
We spent like the last few days.

1134
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I've told DM, you got to make sure that I don't go off on a rant here because we're going to spend the next 45 minutes on that topic.

1135
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So we've done our best to make sure we don't get stuck there.

1136
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I'm trying to keep him on a leash from the whole thing being a necromancer interview, but we'll do what we have to do.

1137
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
I get it.

1138
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Everyone has their thing.

1139
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Some people extrude wolves.

1140
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Some people it's necromanion.

1141
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Some people it's breaking the game with barb permanently.

1142
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Everybody's got their thing.

1143
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,000
All right.

1144
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
So with that being said, I think we've stalled enough to let the people roll in.

1145
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
If you're not here by now, we're just going to get going.

1146
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
We kind of had just, we're wasting a minute or two because it's, we're a couple minutes early.

1147
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:04,000
But with that being said, thank you everyone for joining across the different live stream platforms for this interview with Blizzard's own Adam Jackson.

1148
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Before we get going, you wanted to say who you are, what your job is over there for the people that for some reason don't happen to know.

1149
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Yeah, totally.

1150
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
So hi, everybody.

1151
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
My name is Adam Jackson.

1152
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm the lead class designer, specifically on the live classes team.

1153
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So our group handles a lot of the update, pretty much all the balance updates that you see going into the game for classes.

1154
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:34,000
We also are heavily involved in systems and the stuff that you see really in seasonal and expansion releases that have to do with the things that you farm and why and the classes themselves.

1155
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And the new legendaries, uniques going in, that kind of stuff.

1156
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And Ghazi, introduce yourself for the people that don't know.

1157
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Minion Andy, I guess is the easiest way to describe it.

1158
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I do mostly rethink guides called ARPG games.

1159
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Mostly for Path of Exile Diablo 4, Lost Epoch recently.

1160
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Just a hard minion enjoyer.

1161
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I can't get enough of it.

1162
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Minion Andy Ghazi.

1163
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And of course, I'm DM.

1164
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
And with that being said, we're going to get going.

1165
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So thank you, first of all, for joining us for the interview.

1166
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
It is now 1 p.m. PST.

1167
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
We're going to start with our first question.

1168
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
So right out of the get-go, we have some questions.

1169
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Hopefully, we can get to all of them.

1170
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
If we don't, it's all good.

1171
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:22,000
We're going to start with the first one here, which is, with the recent focus of gameplay being post-100, the 1 to 50 process, a little faster than it used to be on launch, right?

1172
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
What are the team's thoughts on progressing the Paragon system, an example being like new Paragon boards, etc.?

1173
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Yeah.

1174
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:40,000
So I think there's definitely room, I believe, and this is like my personal opinion talking here, but I think that there's definitely room to make Paragon more interesting.

1175
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Adding new boards and things is always on the table.

1176
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
That is something that we can do and probably is something that we will do.

1177
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,000
But the way that we kind of think of Paragon is that it's kind of your one-stop shop where we try to make stats cool, right?

1178
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Like, why you care about strength, why you care about whatever stats you're chasing.

1179
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Like, it's one of those places where we try to make it a little bit more interesting and robust.

1180
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:11,000
I think we did a decent job at the launch game with Paragon, but I think that there's more that we could add to the depth of the system to make it just more appealing.

1181
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
You know, we did a little bit of that in Season 2, if you remember.

1182
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:23,000
We started adding scaling mechanics where we turn some of your stats that are always additive into multiplicative scaling stats, like usually in Legendary Paragon nodes and other places.

1183
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
But that's kind of a little bit of experimentation in that regard.

1184
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I would expect that we do more in the future.

1185
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Of course, nothing to announce, but that's kind of how we're thinking about it right now, is that it's cool.

1186
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
We think there's more opportunity to do cool things there.

1187
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Something simple like adding new boards, yeah.

1188
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I don't think there's really a high risk there, and it's something that I could totally see us doing.

1189
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I'm curious to the idea of the further development of the Paragon system, because I know in the interview you had with Rax, the question regarding the skill tree was that the idea was to not further develop that, at least not too much, for the sake of newer and newer players.

1190
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
And then after level 50, we see a progression of that part being the game focus for the company.

1191
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:10,000
But how does the team think about the progression of that development without making it too advanced for those players?

1192
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Yeah, good question.

1193
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Paragon board sits in a different place than the skill tree, right?

1194
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Skill tree is like the very first thing you're introduced to as a player.

1195
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:32,000
So keeping that experience really easy to understand and robust for someone that's never played an ARPG before is a much harder task compared to Paragon, where Paragon, you've already gotten pretty far into the game or beat the campaign is our expectation.

1196
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So we're allowed to add more complexity at that point in the game.

1197
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:52,000
That being said, there are some like UX issues that I think we know about with Paragon, like, you know, it can be a pain to reset and fill in all the many little blips that you have to like, I think those are actually more concerning issues that I would rather see us tackle than only adding new content.

1198
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think we can do both, of course.

1199
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
But these are kinds of the things of the problems that we're looking to solve, I guess you could say with Paragon.

1200
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Simplicity is always a factor because we do want people to understand our game and ARPGs are notoriously crunchy.

1201
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:14,000
But if there is a place that we can be a little crunchier, I would say it is in Paragon, if anywhere in our game, if that makes sense.

1202
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
That's fair.

1203
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:26,000
We can move on to the next question that we have is that as many people are planning their builds in season four, and we would like to ask for some clarity pre-launch regarding tempering affixes,

1204
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,000
mostly due to the fact that the patch notes stated that they'd be balanced but lack specific details.

1205
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And I guess the same question applies to core modifiers such as ranks of Golem Mastery being available in multiple item slots.

1206
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Yeah, lots of people like to ask about Golem Mastery.

1207
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:55,000
So I guess what I would say is when it comes to patch notes and what we show to players between PTR and live is that we kind of have rules and guidelines for how we present patch notes and what we put in them

1208
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
between releases.

1209
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And PTR is kind of a special case because PTR, we're introducing new content to you for the first time, but then the live patch is actually when we introduce that content for real.

1210
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And I'm using air quotes, right?

1211
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Because not everybody is expected to play the PTR.

1212
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
PTR is also notoriously not balanced because it's way earlier in development than when we would normally release something.

1213
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And so managing expectations and how we present patch notes is something that we're still figuring out.

1214
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:32,000
And what that really means is when we introduce whole new systems to the game, we don't specify every single little detail of them.

1215
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:40,000
As an example, in the PTR, when we introduce the recipes, we don't list every single tempering recipe and what the numbers are right now in the PTR notes.

1216
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Because our notes are already huge.

1217
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
It would blow them out and make them way bigger, right?

1218
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,000
And then if we, you know, don't put them in PTR, but then we put them in live, then we blow out those notes.

1219
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And then it's like, well, why didn't you put them in PTR?

1220
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And then if we only show the difference, like only show the things that we change, then people are wondering, well, why did you only show like half the tempering recipes?

1221
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Because those are the ones that you change, but you're not showing the rest.

1222
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
And then it can get confusing of like, well, where are the rest of the recipes, right?

1223
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Like, why don't you just show it all?

1224
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And so like, it's an easy kind of thing to get caught up in what we show.

1225
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
So in the future, I think we can show more.

1226
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:27,000
It just means that we would have to like commit to showing that in the PTR, which then means there's more pressure on the PTR release to have those things in a better state and actually quantify out the bigger list of changes, right?

1227
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
So it depends.

1228
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But as far as like specifics, if you want to know some of the things like that are changing with tempering, there's a whole lot of number changes.

1229
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Most of them are minor and aren't really that big of a deal.

1230
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We did shift around where a few of the recipes or not.

1231
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Yeah, like what stats are and what recipes and that kind of stuff to make more sense based on feedback.

1232
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
And then we did adjust some things that were just the typical.

1233
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
This is early in development and wasn't intended at all, but it's PTR.

1234
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
So, you know, this is when you get to see it.

1235
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
The ranks of Golemasteries in that category.

1236
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I think people were getting crazy, like 25 plus or something ranks.

1237
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
No, it's supposed to be just like every single other passive that you get.

1238
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
It's only in, you know, very few slots and it's very special when you get it.

1239
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
So, you know, if you were planning on making a Golem build where they slam for 2 billion damage, you're not going to do it via mastery ranks.

1240
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
But I'm sure there's other ways to still make things crazy.

1241
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Guys, he got his minion.

1242
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
He got his minion question and he got an answer there nice and early.

1243
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Got it out of the way.

1244
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So since we're talking about the PTR, I just want to slip up an additional follow up to that.

1245
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Did you guys get out of the PTR what you were hoping to get?

1246
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I know the players were excited to actually get their hands on the PTR and test that, etc.

1247
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
But I'm curious if you guys got what you were hoping to get out of launching a PTR.

1248
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Oh, absolutely.

1249
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Absolutely.

1250
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
In spades.

1251
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:48,000
When we released very large swaths of the game, like I would say the launch was the closest to this.

1252
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Season 2 was moderately close to this.

1253
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
But I think this is bigger than that because we updated all of itemization, right?

1254
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
We gave people stats and powers that they never had access to.

1255
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Not limited to uniques where we can very control.

1256
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Like, hey, you get this very specific, special, powerful thing.

1257
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,000
But in items like, you know, tempering affixes and things where we let you get bonus projectiles across the board or area size.

1258
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Those are very high risk things from our point of view.

1259
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And by risk, I mean, like, not only are they scary because of balance, but they're scary because of like PC performance and breaking servers and stuff.

1260
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Because a lot of our game wasn't made in mind with every projectile could not just have one more, but be doubled in the amount.

1261
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Or, you know, the size of these skills were handcrafted to be this is the size.

1262
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
And, you know, we may have a back alley deal like, yep, we're never going to do that again.

1263
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Have a handshake.

1264
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
We're never going to increase it, whatever, because this is what the size is going to be.

1265
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And then we're like, oh, wait, we want to double it and do more than that.

1266
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
We did more than double in PTR.

1267
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,000
We didn't even have a cap.

1268
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And so we have to figure out, like, how we're going to manage these things for the long term and be healthy in the game.

1269
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And PTR was incredibly helpful for that.

1270
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
We got a ton of balance feedback, which is nice.

1271
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
But I would say the bigger important one was, like, how does the game feel?

1272
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Like, the playing through the whole experience of temporary master working and that progression.

1273
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
You know, we can have an idea of it.

1274
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:13,000
But, you know, when you have, you know, 50, 100, 200, even 1,000 people playing it, it's not nearly as much information as you would think compared to, like, 10 million people playing it, right?

1275
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Or whatever.

1276
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Like, when you throw numbers at something, you really see the cracks very quickly and very easily and they're more clear.

1277
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Whereas when we're only testing things internally, we'll be like, oh, this could be a problem or, oh, this doesn't feel great, but it might be fine, right?

1278
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Like, we can have a discussion and we're using our brains and figuring it out, but we don't have the surety that we do when we throw a ton of people at it, especially people who are experts on ARPGs like you guys and, you know, our other creators and even just hardcore community members that really like to crunch these numbers and figure things out.

1279
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
They'll find things in five minutes that might take us five days, right?

1280
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So it's just efficient.

1281
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So, yeah.

1282
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Short answer, yes.

1283
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Incredibly useful.

1284
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I appreciate the insight on that one.

1285
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So moving on to the next question here.

1286
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
So one of the major things that are happening in Season 4 is obviously itemization.

1287
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
That rework is now being complete with Loot Reborn.

1288
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
What would you guys like to focus on next as your next sort of major focus?

1289
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Yeah.

1290
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
That's a really good question.

1291
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I can't get super specific details, but I can give you ideas of how we're thinking about things right now.

1292
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Sure.

1293
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Immediate future, I think actually the focus of the team is on reacting to Season 4 and this big upheaval that we made to the game.

1294
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I am very sure that there will be cracks in tempering and masterworking and the player journey as far as, you know, the pit and how all of this feels when put together of like how good the game actually is.

1295
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And those cracks are going to need to be iterated on and filled a little bit of like, hey, you know, we need more tempering recipes here or, hey, the progression of the pit doesn't feel that great there or whatever.

1296
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Right.

1297
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Our immediate thing is because we upheavled so much in our game, you know, your whole endgame way that you interact with Diablo 4 and your item progression is now a journey rather than just hope the perfect item drops and you're done.

1298
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Those are huge foundational things in ARPG.

1299
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So making those and refining those to be good is the immediate largest concern by a pretty good amount.

1300
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Like when I think when you look at like what we're thinking of with updates with Season 5 right now, I'm being a little bit cagey of like I need to leave some reaction time for my team and myself to like really look at Season 4 of what are the things that we need to react to quickly that would be the most benefit, you know, the biggest bang for your buck in Season 5, for example.

1301
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:34,000
But thinking a little bit more long term, like things that aren't immediate reactions to Season 4, I would say, you know, we're definitely taking a stab at it in Season 4.

1302
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:45,000
But I think that there's still going to be room to try and make the endgame better for longer, like have that tail feel good for a longer period of time and have a little bit more refinement in that section of the game, so to speak.

1303
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:53,000
So we're thinking and talking a lot about that because it's been a thing that we've been, you know, asked about by the community basically since we launched is like better endgame, better endgame, better endgame.

1304
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:05,000
And so that's something that's on our mind. Also on the class side, personally, one of the things that's on my mind a lot is trying to catch up other classes to Barbarian because Barbarians have more weapons.

1305
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
This has been a big thorn in our side for a very long time of that they kind of have two class mechanics and everybody else has one.

1306
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And so our current plan is to kind of juice up those other classes so that they're really crazy, impactful and good and feel awesome so that they kind of make up for the lack of aspects that Barbarians get.

1307
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And itemization makes Barbarians stronger. Like there's a bunch of things that having more items makes difficult to balance, I would say.

1308
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:38,000
And so really having a firm, solid answer to that. We kind of addressed it a little bit in Season 4 with the Necromancer is our first whack at this where we just juiced the Book of the Dead and made it crazy, powerful and good.

1309
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And try to do it in a way that wasn't just numbers, you know, like make it cool. Right. It's something I told my people a lot to focus on.

1310
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And so we're going to see how that goes. But I want to do that for the other classes. Right.

1311
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
So that's kind of one of the big things at the top of our mind on the class side.

1312
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
So with in-game. Oh, sorry, go, guys.

1313
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I was just curious. Like we talk about endgame. That's the focus. Endgame, endgame, endgame.

1314
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I'm curious about the definition. Like what are we talking about when we say endgame?

1315
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And Chris, that's different from it's very subjective, right?

1316
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Are we talking about level 50 to 100 or are we talking about post 100?

1317
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Yep. So funny you ask. I think Joe, he mentioned in an earlier interview, we used to think of endgame as everything after the campaign was our original definition.

1318
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,000
We launched the game and we had to change our definition because that wasn't what players were thinking and saying.

1319
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,000
And the way that just people talked about our game, they thought endgame was post 100 or maybe world tier four.

1320
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Right. And right now, I would say it's still not exactly perfect of what we think of when we say endgame.

1321
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I think people still have various opinions.

1322
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:48,000
My definition of endgame is probably something close to world tier four and when that starts or when you get to level 100 is an obvious benchmark that people can have.

1323
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:57,000
But in my mind, it's when you have access to all of the activities that you can do in the game, which to me would now probably be whenever you go into the pit.

1324
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Because I don't there's no activity after that that is like a new activity that you could not access at all.

1325
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
So that's what I think of when I think of endgame.

1326
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I think if you ask 10 different people, you may get like three or four different answers.

1327
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
But that's kind of how we think about it and talk about it mostly on the team, either that or level 100, you know, if you want to think about it that way.

1328
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:26,000
So how do you deal with the difficulty of creating endgame when players are able to consume the content quicker than almost any developer is going to be able to produce the endgame while also shrinking the beginning portion of the game?

1329
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
You level to 100 faster than you ever have.

1330
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:34,000
You're able to get into these endgame activities faster than ever, but you're also at a deficit in terms of endgame content.

1331
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
So you're developing it while people are consuming it faster than you can.

1332
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
How do you resolve these issues?

1333
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Oh, God, this is a very long answer and I could go into it for a long time.

1334
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
So I'll try to keep it brief.

1335
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:51,000
It's a very difficult problem and it is one that I think every ARPG has and it's one that we all have to kind of live with and mitigate.

1336
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:58,000
But there isn't a perfect forever solution because really what you're saying is and this is like the two things that are competing, right?

1337
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Is players want content and our game is a power fantasy.

1338
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
That's what ARPGs are, right?

1339
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
We sell you on.

1340
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,000
You do things to become more powerful, to have a new mountain to climb, to be more powerful, to have a new mountain to climb.

1341
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
The problem is there are only so many mountains that we could make as a development team, right?

1342
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Because the mountains are usually content.

1343
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And so the difficulty that I think every ARPG runs into is you can only create so many mountains.

1344
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
So the first thing we try to do is create as many mountains as we can, right?

1345
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Have as many various endgame activities and things for you to do that are interesting and awesome.

1346
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And then, you know, do that for as long as we can.

1347
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
But like you said, people are crazy and they consume content really, really quick.

1348
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Some of them do.

1349
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Some of them not so much.

1350
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And we have to balance between those two player types, which is a whole other conversation.

1351
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:57,000
But then on the other side, you know, for the people that can consume that content quickly, we want to make sure that there's things for them to do that are interesting and meaningful, right?

1352
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And so this is why you see a very common way that ARPGs are designed is that we use random generated dungeons and random generated content for the endgame.

1353
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:16,000
And why we do things like scale things either pretty hard or infinitely so that you have a challenge against your player power, right?

1354
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Like player power goes up.

1355
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
You need something to fight against it as you're getting better.

1356
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:27,000
If you don't have something to fight against it, then really your answers are like make another character and do the journey again or you get bored, leave, come back later, right?

1357
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And those are kind of the options that a player has or, you know, go against infinitely scaling content.

1358
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,000
That's kind of like the box that we're in when we're designing.

1359
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:44,000
And a lot of our work as designers is how do we make fun content and resolve these issues as best we can.

1360
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:56,000
A perfect solution is what requires like a paradigm shift, I think, of like you have to kind of change what an ARPG is and like make your game ARPG, but also a little bit of something else that you don't have to worry about this problem.

1361
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:04,000
But in an ARPG space, I think this is kind of just what it is and how people progress through it is a challenge that we're forever going to have.

1362
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And so you're going to see us, you know, kind of bounce back and forth of like infinitely scaling content, but also matching that with milestone content or aspirational content is another word that people like to use that I like.

1363
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Of, you know, like Uber Lilith or these things where it's like, I get this thing, I see this thing, it's a fixed difficulty, I want to get good enough to beat that and then I feel good and I can either stop or try and go to the next thing until there's things that run out and then I'm happy and I leave happy.

1364
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Right.

1365
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Our goal at the higher level is that you leave happy.

1366
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Right.

1367
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And whether that means you're doing aspirational or you do forever content for a while and then you kind of churn out.

1368
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
We want to make sure both of those experiences feel good.

1369
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Sure.

1370
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,000
That's fair.

1371
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Listening to that answer, I mean, do you feel like or would it be fair to say that the team's focus on effort right now has gone from the early stage of focusing on new player acquisition to more of a returning player focus and endgame replayability and longevity of the player base?

1372
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Is that where the focus is?

1373
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Would that be fair to say?

1374
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
We're focused on both.

1375
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I think my team right now is focused on the latter part, but remember Diablo 4 is a large team with many different sub teams.

1376
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I'm on the live team.

1377
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So my focus right now is kind of endgame because that's just what we see as a place we could do better.

1378
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:28,000
But there are people on the team absolutely focused on new player experience, new player, how they interact with the game, returning players that have, you know, they played the original campaign and then left and they're coming back.

1379
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
That's a discussion that we're having as well.

1380
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
How do we make that experience the best that we can?

1381
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:38,000
So there's actually a lot of different classes of players and the types of people that play Diablo 4 because it's such a large game.

1382
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:45,000
You know, we're trying to appeal to many different types of people that play RPGs and even those that this is their introductory game.

1383
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:52,000
So our task is a little different than than some other games where, you know, they have a more specific focus.

1384
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
We try to grab it all.

1385
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,000
We're greedy.

1386
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
But, you know, we want to make sure that game is good for both parties.

1387
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And that does mean there's some sacrifices sometimes.

1388
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
We really are like trying to make it good for all of them.

1389
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
That's a hard problem.

1390
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
But that is actually what we're trying to do.

1391
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Like high level vision.

1392
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Let's just move on to the next question since we're kind of limited on time.

1393
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Yeah.

1394
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Let's talk about overworld content since that is literally the identity defining for Diablo 4.

1395
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Right.

1396
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And the question we have is what are the team's thoughts on the potentials of strongholds and bosses having a bigger role to play moving forward?

1397
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Strongholds and bosses.

1398
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I guess I'll ask you a question back.

1399
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I can give you a very easy answer.

1400
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And that answer will be we think they're cool and we could work on them.

1401
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Or I can give you like something I think is a lot more interesting than maybe an in-depth discussion.

1402
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I'll leave it up to you guys.

1403
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Let's go for the latter.

1404
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Yeah.

1405
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
All right.

1406
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Because I find this very interesting.

1407
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Why strongholds, why we design them and what we think about them in Borobosses.

1408
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So I think there's a concept that's very interesting.

1409
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:04,000
I would advise you and anyone that any of your followers would really want to get into game design or want to talk better about game design.

1410
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,000
There was a really great GDC presentation made by a guy named Alex Jaffe.

1411
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
He's from Riot actually.

1412
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And he gave one of the best presentations I've ever seen on game design.

1413
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And he gave a presentation on something called cursed problems in game design.

1414
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
And I promise this will lead back to strongholds very directly.

1415
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:32,000
But what a cursed problem is in game design is this idea that when you make a game of a certain archetype, you immediately make a bunch of promises to the player.

1416
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And these promises come with problems that we call cursed problems.

1417
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:43,000
There are these things that are so fundamental to the foundation of your game that you can't get away from them.

1418
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
And they're kind of your partner forever or weight on your back that you have to deal with that you never get rid of.

1419
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
But you can mitigate.

1420
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I'll give an example of a cursed problem in another genre and game.

1421
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I used to work on Heroes of the Storm.

1422
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,000
It's a MOBA, right?

1423
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Like League of Legends.

1424
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:03,000
If you ever played League of Legends, you'll hear this complaint a lot of matchmaking and playing a team-based game by having individual progression, right?

1425
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
The promise that you make when you play a MOBA or a team-based game is that you are playing with other people.

1426
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,000
But one of the big things that they sell you on when you play the game is that you have a ranking system that's based on your personal improvement.

1427
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:20,000
So you're being ranked individually, but you go into a team game with nine other people and those other people can interact.

1428
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And you can have a game where you couldn't have won no matter how good you are because those people impact your performance.

1429
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
And so you commonly get the complaint of, hey, I went into a team-based game.

1430
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I did well, but my teammates suck and I'm mad because I lost ranking points, right?

1431
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Very common.

1432
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:42,000
This is a cursed problem of matchmaking-based, team-based games where your motivation that we promise you is individual performance.

1433
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:43,000
How about Diablo?

1434
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Let's tie it back to Diablo.

1435
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:52,000
A cursed problem, I would argue, in ARPGs like Diablo and any other game, you'll probably have seen this problem, is that they are games of efficiency.

1436
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:58,000
We promise you player power is a big reason why you play these games.

1437
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:11,000
You want to go in, you start off as this peon person that kind of sucks and isn't very strong, and you grow into this really crazy master of magic or strength or whatever that can do incredible things, right?

1438
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:21,000
And the way that we deliver you on that promise is we give you power as you play the game more and progress through the activities, usually in the form of gear, but also in other ways too, right?

1439
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Skill points, paragon, whatever it is.

1440
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:35,000
What that translates to is that anything that you are doing in the game that isn't progressing your power is very hard to sell a player on to make them want to do it.

1441
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And it's even harder to sell them if it's not a repeatable activity that they can keep doing to get stronger and stronger.

1442
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:53,000
The way that I describe cursed problems or think about it is like when you ask me, hey, Adam, what do you think of strongholds or world bosses or uber lilith balance or a whole lot of other problems?

1443
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I would think of these cursed problems like a tree, and the cursed problem is actually the trunk, the center of the game, what the game actually is and why you come to play it.

1444
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And you're asking me about a leaf at the very edge of the branch.

1445
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And so I can give an answer like, yeah, the leaf, yeah, it's cool.

1446
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,000
We can work on it.

1447
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:18,000
But like really, the leaf connecting to the branch, connecting to the trunk, this is what's actually causing the thing that you're asking the question about, right?

1448
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
So when it comes to strongholds, why are strongholds, why do you ask me the question like, hey, what about strongholds?

1449
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Can we make them better?

1450
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:42,000
The reason why it's a question that people ask, I think, is because people, strongholds are intended and why they are cool and why they go against the rest of our game and why it's really hard for us is that they are meant to be one shot, awesome, kind of story based, really handcrafted, curated content, right?

1451
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I would equate this to uber lilith statues where we got this question the other day.

1452
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:55,000
The campaign experience, these are all actually the same question, which is, hey, you people on D4 made this one shot experience that we really love and is cool.

1453
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
We want to do it more.

1454
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:03,000
The problem is the moment you cross that line from one shotting and it being cool to being a repeatable activity.

1455
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Now that activity is competing with everything else in the game that is repeatable content.

1456
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Because now strongholds has to compete against Helltide, Nightmare Dungeons, The Pit, Gathering Uniques, all of that, or has to fit in there in some way.

1457
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
So one question about that then.

1458
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
So what makes strongholds different?

1459
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Like why can't we do an uber version of a stronghold since people say they want to replay it, but we can do an uber version of bosses that are already in the game.

1460
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So we can do the level...

1461
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Absolutely.

1462
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

1463
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I understand your question.

1464
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
We absolutely can, is the answer.

1465
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
But then you've changed it.

1466
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
The fundamental relationship that you have as a player with strongholds is different now.

1467
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:47,000
You've changed it from one shot, this is a cool experience, that's very unique, and that is what the fantasy is of people that like it.

1468
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Now you've changed that to repeatable content that you're going to do 10, 20, 100 times over.

1469
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And the thing is, a lot of content, and this is where it's kind of a curse problem in the RPG, we think of every content type that we add this way.

1470
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Is it repeatable?

1471
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Is it not?

1472
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
And the way that you design that content is very different.

1473
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Because if it's repeatable, that means that you have to design the content in such a way that it is fun 100 or 1,000 times.

1474
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
That puts a lot more design constraint and limitations of what you can make that content.

1475
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:22,000
As an example, or many examples, when we launch the game, you can even think of some when you think of your experience with the game.

1476
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
When you do something 500 times, you care about things that you wouldn't care about if you did it one time.

1477
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,000
This is why, for example, I get questions a lot of, can you let us reset boss rooms?

1478
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Why do you want to reset boss rooms?

1479
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
It's because you do it 500 times and it sucks to do that every single time.

1480
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
If you had to do it one or two times ever, you wouldn't care very much.

1481
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Why did you have to ride your horse to Nightmare Dungeons when we launched the game?

1482
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
It's fair.

1483
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It was fun the first time. World building, immersion, really cool.

1484
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Doing it 500 times because that's all that you're doing at your endgame, not so fun.

1485
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,000
So would you be concerned about the same issue with the new 200 bosses?

1486
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,000
If let's say you took some of the rewards, okay, and added like an Uber, just for the sake of the debate here.

1487
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
So let's say we wanted Uber Strongholds and you say, well, you know, DM, you liked it the first time.

1488
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
You might not like it the 100th time.

1489
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
And I say, fair enough.

1490
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:12,000
But then I come back with you and say, okay, well, what if we took some of the rewards I would either get from the pit, like a grab bag.

1491
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
We take some of the pit rewards.

1492
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
We take some of the Uber level 200 rewards.

1493
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:23,000
And we throw almost like a world boss loop pinata as an option to be one of these mountains that you mentioned earlier.

1494
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Maybe we don't want to make it the best thing.

1495
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Maybe we want to make it a breakup of the experience so that we can get basically the same resources we got to get literally anyway from something else.

1496
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
But it gives us variety in terms of gameplay.

1497
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Now, I'm not arguing this is the best way to go with the game.

1498
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I'm just curious about the thought process behind that.

1499
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I think that's a good question.

1500
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
The answer is yes, we can.

1501
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Sometimes it works.

1502
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Sometimes it doesn't.

1503
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Usually it doesn't.

1504
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:54,000
The reason why in my experience designing ARPGs for a while now is it's really hard to tell somebody, hey, you have option A and option B.

1505
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Option A is 100% efficient.

1506
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Option B is 70% efficient.

1507
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
What does 100% of players do?

1508
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Maxroll makes guides.

1509
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
What is the best nightmare dungeon you want to do?

1510
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Everybody makes guides.

1511
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
What is the quickest way to do the thing?

1512
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
What is the most efficient?

1513
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
People are going to do the thing.

1514
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:18,000
And it's not like if something is 100% efficient versus 50%, that 50% of players do the 50% and the other half do the 100%.

1515
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
That's not how it works out in player behavior.

1516
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
It's 99% of people do the 100%.

1517
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:23,000
That's a fair counter.

1518
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,000
That's a fair counter.

1519
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I'm not sure I agree entirely.

1520
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I'm a player that I guess I would qualify as a blaster and not a casual player.

1521
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:41,000
But I feel like what makes an ARPG great is to make people distracted from the fact that they are playing an ARPG.

1522
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Because in reality, an ARPG game is honestly the very definition of insanity.

1523
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:54,000
We are doing the same thing over and over and over again with the only goal of improving our character to continue doing the same thing over and over again to do the same thing.

1524
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:01,000
And the best ARPG is the game that you can play would be a game where you are distracted from the fact that you are doing the same thing over and over again.

1525
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So having options, whether or not they are slightly less rewarding, that's another topic.

1526
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:15,000
But the fact that you have options to engage with for the sake of in-game replayability, longevity, would allow you to be distracted from that fact and actually enjoy your time.

1527
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,000
That's the way I see it.

1528
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
So I'm not sure I entirely agree with that.

1529
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I completely agree with you.

1530
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I want to premise this.

1531
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I'm presenting to you the problem.

1532
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I'm not saying that a cursed problem has no solutions and no ways to make it better.

1533
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:38,000
The bulk of my time is spent trying to answer the questions that you guys just asked and do it in a way that does make it better, even though I know it's a problem that will never be completely absolutely solved.

1534
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Right.

1535
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
We do do things like this.

1536
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Some ways, for example, that we get you to do a variety of activities because we do want you to is like a common strategy is we get certain rewards behind certain activities, which makes you you need to go and do multiple things.

1537
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Right.

1538
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Like you have glyph XP and nightmare dungeons.

1539
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:58,000
You have the hell tide, the cinders and hell tide that you couldn't really get very easily.

1540
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Like we have things that are special to them to make you go around.

1541
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I think a better solution, we've kind of moved a little bit more in this is you can get things you get some activities or materials or whatever from many places.

1542
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,000
There is one place that is the most efficient, but you're getting pseudo efficiency somewhere else.

1543
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
And that feels really good.

1544
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Example of this would be doing hell tides with whispers.

1545
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Right.

1546
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,000
If you're doing hell tides and you want Varshan materials for whispers, double dipping on that feels really good as a player.

1547
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
And we want to do that and do that more.

1548
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
And that, I think, is kind of an answer for your Uber strongholds question is I'm not saying, by the way,

1549
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
my answer is not we can't do Uber strongholds because of these problems.

1550
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,000
What I'm saying is I'm trying to teach you why it's not so easy as just like, hey, make Uber strongholds replayable.

1551
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And now everybody's going to love them immediately.

1552
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Right.

1553
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
We were changing a content type from a one shot.

1554
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
This is kind of similar to the campaign idea.

1555
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Right.

1556
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
But changing the campaign experience from a one shot to a feels good 100 times.

1557
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
We have to think about that.

1558
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
We think about that content differently now.

1559
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Totally.

1560
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
And that requires a little more thought and care, not just in rewards, but how it feels to go through it over and over again.

1561
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Right.

1562
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Because it's fixed.

1563
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
That's fair enough.

1564
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
You need to have some randomness to make it feel better as you're going through it over and over.

1565
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,000
It makes sense.

1566
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
There's more problems that we have to solve.

1567
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Right.

1568
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
It's a design consumable.

1569
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
You make it into something repetitive.

1570
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
It changes the fundamentals of how you originally created it.

1571
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I can understand the take.

1572
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I appreciate that.

1573
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I'll move the conversation on here so we can get into some of the other questions we still have here.

1574
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:25,000
So currently, build variety in the game is mostly designed around item modifier.

1575
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
So like unique items, lidless wallets being one example.

1576
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
It just fundamentally changes the way its skill works here.

1577
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Has there been discussion from the team around modifying skills potentially outside of unique items?

1578
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Like within Paragon boards, other inventory-based items, whatever you want to call it.

1579
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Yeah.

1580
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Fun fact, when we were originally designing things in the game, a lot of the changing of the skills was actually in the skill tree.

1581
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
And then we called the maybe choices.

1582
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
But you know the different upgrades you could get for your skill.

1583
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So the original thought behind it was like, you know, you can make your, you know, frozen orb like option A is like way different than option B where they're almost like different use cases for the skill.

1584
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Right.

1585
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
And we moved a little bit away from that.

1586
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Some of them are still a little transformative.

1587
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I think that we can make them a little bit more so in the skill tree as we do in the future.

1588
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
That's one way that I think we can make the skill tree interesting without introducing a bunch of complexity.

1589
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
My favorite example I give to people on my team is a kick.

1590
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:29,000
You know, kick isn't that popular of a skill, but the difference between baseline kick and power kick, the upgrade where it changes into basically a core skill where it uses all your resource and does a buttload of damage to a person.

1591
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:35,000
You know, you went from thinking of, you know, this skill is like you think of the geometry of the game and kicking enemies into walls.

1592
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
And it was too complex, I think, a little bit for what we launched with the speed of our game.

1593
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,000
But the idea was there of like one way is you're playing 40 chests and you're rewarded.

1594
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:49,000
And the other way is you chase a resource and you just, you know, this is Sparta somebody and kill them for a billion damage.

1595
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Right.

1596
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,000
It's completely different fantasies and ways that you interact with a skill.

1597
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I think we could probably do a little bit more there with other skills to kind of make them transformative like that.

1598
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:10,000
We ended up doing more legendaries and uniques as the space that we do that because we knew that items were so important and being excited for a late game item to drop was was a very core part of the game.

1599
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
We've kind of now made that a lot better with like greater affixes, for example, and things in season four.

1600
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
So I think there is more room to make transformative upgrades in other places than items.

1601
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:29,000
But we I also am very comfortable with the system that we have now, and I kind of like it gives you obvious things to chase with items.

1602
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
And it feels good to get an item that is a big upgrade that changes how you play.

1603
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:40,000
So I guess I'd be open to feedback from people like, is there a place that you think is superior to items to get these kinds of effects?

1604
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Like, is it cooler to have it be deterministic in the Paragon board versus you're farming for something and you see the moment that it drops that transforms your gameplay?

1605
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I mean, I'd be in the boat of saying, you know, make the skill tweak going to grow into a tree.

1606
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
That's kind of the boat that I'm sitting in.

1607
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:02,000
But I also understand from the interview you had with Rax, how that is there's reasons for that to keeping that simplistic.

1608
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:10,000
So it makes sense to have it in the endgame version of something dropping or, you know, a gem or whatever you want to go for a power or unique item.

1609
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Yeah.

1610
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:20,000
But how unless you have any follow up questions that day, I wanted to ask you about the the how that fits into the philosophy of a lead class designer when it comes to the fantasies,

1611
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:26,000
these altering skills or uniques, whatever you want to go for, would have an impact on the class design.

1612
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I'm sorry, not quite sure.

1613
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I'm going to try to reword that.

1614
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:31,000
That was horrible.

1615
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Don't worry.

1616
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:48,000
No, I was wondering how the these unique items are skill altering modifiers, no matter where you get them, how that would impact the class design when it comes to focusing on keeping or maintaining the specific fantasies of classes.

1617
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Yeah.

1618
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:59,000
So when I think of a build or a team thinks of a build, we try and think of the entire package and we compare it to the whole other package of a class.

1619
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I don't think of a build like, I don't know, frozen orb, let's say.

1620
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Right.

1621
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
When I think of like the total power and coolness and strength and all that, there's a journey to be made.

1622
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
But I think of it as you end with all the things.

1623
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Right.

1624
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
You end with the conjurations, casting frozen orbs and you're blowing up everything on your screen.

1625
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
It's awesome.

1626
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Right.

1627
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:30,000
So when we think about like designing a new class or when we're first designing these classes, we have to think of, you know, how do we make an interesting and good player journey from the beginning when you first use a skill, making that as impactful and cool as possible.

1628
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:37,000
While at the same time, balancing against you need to leave room for growth and making things crazy and also to make it better.

1629
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Some skills are easier to do than others with that, I would say.

1630
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:47,000
We definitely had a lot of things before the game came out, discussions about like, hey, this skill doesn't it feels really crappy early on.

1631
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And we're like, yeah, it gets really crazy later on, though.

1632
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
They're like, yeah, but who's going to pick it up if it feels really shitty early on?

1633
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Right.

1634
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Like you have to balance the two things.

1635
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,000
And that one is like it's just a bunch of discussions and iteration, even when the game is live of people complain about it.

1636
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Right.

1637
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
And we're like, yeah, we agree.

1638
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:01,000
And then we change it.

1639
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Example, that would be like Barb's and Druids for a while have been complaining that early game kind of sucks, but then late game, the powerhouses.

1640
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
And that's kind of been the identity.

1641
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
And so we've been like alleviating over and over again, like basic skills are a little better.

1642
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:13,000
They're a little better.

1643
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
We don't want to go too far, but we keep making them better.

1644
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Right.

1645
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
So that's kind of how we think of it.

1646
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
We think of the whole package and we try to make sure that your journey is enjoyable and good.

1647
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
And that's true, by the way, with items and tempering and stuff.

1648
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Right.

1649
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
We tried to create that journey and itemization.

1650
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,000
That was the point of season four, because we think that's what makes a good ARPG experience.

1651
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Absolutely.

1652
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
So we have we're approaching about 10 minutes or so left here, right around there.

1653
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:44,000
So we do have some rapid fire section, which I mean, not all of these are just yes and no type thing.

1654
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So you feel free to talk about these.

1655
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Don't have to just be like one word answers.

1656
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
But we have about 15, 20 of these.

1657
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I'm going to try to blast through that.

1658
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
These are mostly primary questions.

1659
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Grab from YouTube comments.

1660
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Grab from the chats, etc.

1661
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
The community just continues to ask over and over again.

1662
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Some of these may have already been asked.

1663
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Apologize if they have.

1664
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
But just because they've been spammed quite a bit.

1665
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:08,000
One of the ones we've seen quite often is people are asking about raids.

1666
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
So we have overworld bosses, right?

1667
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Pretty cool.

1668
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,000
People like them.

1669
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
It's like a big loop in the out every now and then.

1670
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Is there any plans of further developments?

1671
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Or have you guys thought about potentially of raids like eight man, ten man related to clans?

1672
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Larger size, basically.

1673
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Yeah.

1674
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:30,000
First, I would say this is just Adam's personal opinion, not the team, because I know everybody has different thoughts on it.

1675
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
But I think raids are interesting and cool.

1676
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:39,000
I think that they would present quite a few hurdles for us to overcome that make things tough.

1677
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I think they're probably doable.

1678
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,000
But as an example of some of the things I think of right away that are like, oh my god, this is scary.

1679
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Even now, we have a problem where we're always competing against solo players efficiency versus group play efficiency.

1680
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:02,000
There's a lot of people that play Diablo in RPGs that really have a strong identity with wanting to play by themselves and not be required to go into a group.

1681
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:14,000
And if we put in this type of content where we say, hey, you must go into a group to play this, then we have to reconcile that of like, hey, how do we either balance that around solo players do it all as well?

1682
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
And if they do, then why is it group content?

1683
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Or yeah, too bad.

1684
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
You have to also be in a group to engage with this.

1685
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:30,000
And then that puts a lot of pressure on the rewards for that content because if we make the rewards something that a solo player also needs, then we're making them go into a group when they may not want to.

1686
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Sure.

1687
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:37,000
But if we make the solo or we make the rewards for that type of content the other way where it's not something you need, then why do people do it in the first place?

1688
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
So there's a lot of questions there that are noodley, that are tough to answer.

1689
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Sure.

1690
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
But I'm really just describing the problem space.

1691
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I do think, though, that overall, the idea of getting with a group of your buddies or random strangers and doing like a 10-man fight on a huge like, you know, dungeon or whatever with a big boss at the end that requires mechanics, like that is really cool and appealing.

1692
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
So that's kind of how I think of it.

1693
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
So I got two more quick ones here and I'll pass off to Ghazi.

1694
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:10,000
So in that case, then, if there's issues related to like having forcing group play, basically, let's go the other way and say solo self-out mode.

1695
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Now that trading is more common here with legendary items, etc., have we seen the potential for maybe adding an additional game mode or other game modes?

1696
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I think it'd be cool nothing to announce today.

1697
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Fair enough.

1698
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Next one.

1699
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:23,000
PvP.

1700
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:32,000
There is a small but very passionate PvP community that is curious about further plans involving content specifically for these groups of people.

1701
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
I promise I might ask this one for them.

1702
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
What are your thoughts on PvP within the game?

1703
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Sure.

1704
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I don't have anything to announce when it comes to PvP specific content.

1705
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I would say we, I think we would be more interested from those people.

1706
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Like what would they want to see from us?

1707
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I would actually be curious about of like, what do you want?

1708
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Do you want like an arena type system where we pre-program your gear for you?

1709
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Do you like open world?

1710
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Do you, do you want some type of different progression system?

1711
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:15,000
You know, kind of like the group versus solo play, the PvE versus PvE discussion is a little similar of like, the more that we emphasize it or give unique rewards to it, the more that we're saying to everybody that doesn't want to do that, hey, you must do this to progress your character.

1712
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
And that's back to that, you know, cursed problem trunk theory.

1713
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Like, you know, everything is about power progression.

1714
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:30,000
So the moment we put power in an activity that's a little more niche, then we can really make people unhappy if that's, if they have to engage with that.

1715
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
So like, what would they want to see?

1716
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Do they want to see a better way of interacting with PvP?

1717
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Is it just that the balance is crazy?

1718
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Because I think that people kind of embrace the crazy balance in Diablo PvP.

1719
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
But that's where I think I would start the discussion.

1720
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Thanks for the answer.

1721
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
That's fair.

1722
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
When it comes to these questions, these rapid fire questions, we got them from chat and from YouTube.

1723
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,000
And one of the questions that we wanted us to ask was, can we see how long people have been offline in our clans?

1724
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Clam management issues currently.

1725
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1726
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I'm not involved with that group, so I can't give a damn.

1727
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I actually don't know, but I feel like that's very reasonable.

1728
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I think we could bring that back to the team pretty easily.

1729
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I will say we do have a team that works on like UX issues, user experience issues.

1730
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
And they are the ones that kind of look at stuff like that.

1731
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Like, you know, the ideas that we get over, like Group Pinder or Armory Party Finder.

1732
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
This type of support, we have a team that's looking at it.

1733
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,000
I know that they're working on stuff, but I actually don't have complete insight into what they're doing.

1734
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
But that seems very reasonable to me.

1735
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Stuff. I like it.

1736
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
The next question is actually about pets in-game.

1737
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:38,000
And we're talking about non-combat pets, ranging from cosmetics to maybe loot pets that might only loot gold or something.

1738
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Is that something that has been discussed?

1739
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
If so, what can you share?

1740
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
We have discussed it.

1741
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I think it'd be cool.

1742
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Don't have anything to share.

1743
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:46,000
All right.

1744
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Next question would be...

1745
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Sorry?

1746
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Go on.

1747
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I was just going to read the next one.

1748
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:52,000
All right.

1749
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
It's just DPS meter and dummies.

1750
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
I would love to see that because you can't really see it when you have a minion army hitting a dummy.

1751
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I'd like to have DPS meters.

1752
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Is that something we're going to see in the future?

1753
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Sure.

1754
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Yeah.

1755
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Think it's cool.

1756
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Don't have anything to announce.

1757
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Fair enough.

1758
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Yeah.

1759
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
But I'm actually thinking a little bit more about that.

1760
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:17,000
And maybe feedback would be useful of like, is it really only on dummies that you want to do it to test builds?

1761
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Or would you want to see it in the rest of the game?

1762
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
DPS meters are kind of notorious in other game types, but I'm not sure that we have the same problems.

1763
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Sure.

1764
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Of people being upset with each other for not doing as much damage and all that kind of stuff.

1765
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Fair enough.

1766
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I feel like it'd probably be fine, or at least for a personal one.

1767
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I know this one's probably like, you can't go anywhere with this, but offline mode, is there any potential for an offline mode in Diablo 4 at any point?

1768
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I have not heard any discussions about it.

1769
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
I would doubt it.

1770
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Okay.

1771
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I think that one, I think I'm a little more sure I could say, but I don't see it on the horizon.

1772
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Fair enough.

1773
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
And also I'm not in charge of those kinds of decisions.

1774
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Glyph leveling and quality of life.

1775
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Is there any potential for glyph leveling outside of Nightmare Dungeons?

1776
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Are we going to add experience to glyphs elsewhere in the game?

1777
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
We've talked about it a bit.

1778
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Nothing to announce.

1779
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I think kind of going back to the idea with Helltides and Whispers, I think it is cool to have a less efficient way to do something while you're being efficient doing something else.

1780
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
That's my personal opinion, though, and kind of what I feel.

1781
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:28,000
But I'm not on the systems team and don't know the nuances of glyph leveling specifically and why we keep it in one place.

1782
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
But I wouldn't be surprised, I guess is what I would say.

1783
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
But I don't have a guarantee there.

1784
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:38,000
How about things like surprise events, i.e. goblin vaults from D3, for example?

1785
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,000
You get a ring, you go to secondary, you can pop out or pour those to other types of things.

1786
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Any surprise ambush related event type of stuff?

1787
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
We have the goblin packs, for instance, which is pretty cool in D4.

1788
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Rare but cool.

1789
01:54:49,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Yeah, we've added a couple in Season 4, kind of mini events where you have a chance when you kill an elite and it'll spawn into a ton of gold or a ton of materials or things or give you way more than normal.

1790
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
We like the idea of surprise events.

1791
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I think you can expect us to make more in the future.

1792
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:15,000
That is one way, kind of like what I think it was, Gazzy, I think you said, of like we want to break up the monotony.

1793
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
And we're trying to make sure that it feels different, even though you're doing the same thing.

1794
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
And I think surprise events is one of the ways that we do that.

1795
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Sometimes it's more successful than others, but it's definitely something that we want to continue to chase because we think overall it's good.

1796
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
It's just about how exactly to implement it.

1797
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:30,000
That's fair.

1798
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
What's the team's position on support builds?

1799
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Like back in D3, we have CDPS, Demon Hunters, and Barb-style builds.

1800
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Do they have a place in D4 moving forward?

1801
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
That's a good question.

1802
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I think so, but we have to be careful.

1803
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
We were a lot more scared about it when we launched the game.

1804
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I remember people kept asking me, like, Adam, can we make more support builds, make more things.

1805
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Like cross synergy is really cool, and I agree it's cool.

1806
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,000
The other side of that is kind of that issue we deal with forever of group versus solo play,

1807
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:08,000
is that the better we make a support build, the more we're saying the best way to play this game is to go with four people,

1808
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,000
support your friends, and you get multiplicative, massively increased amounts of output, right?

1809
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,000
So I think we do want it.

1810
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
We have it a little bit with Barbarian Shouts, right?

1811
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
And we've even added some legendaries that do it.

1812
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Like there's a Druid one that turns your Blood Howl into an AoE buff.

1813
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
But I don't think it's one of those we have to walk the line very carefully, I think,

1814
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
because it can be very detrimental to the game if we go too far.

1815
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
But I'm not against it as an idea at all.

1816
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Okay.

1817
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
I'll jump over to the next one real quick with opening community events.

1818
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Way back to like Blizzard AQ openings in World of Warcraft, for example.

1819
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Community designs are legendary.

1820
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Any sort of community events surrounding those things.

1821
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
What are your thoughts on that?

1822
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I think it'd be awesome.

1823
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I'm not against it at all, but those are checks that I can't cash.

1824
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
So yeah, I would love to.

1825
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I'm not going to make it.

1826
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:03,000
But yes, I would love an AQ event like that in D4 or something.

1827
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Or even community making it legendary.

1828
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Oh, how scared am I of that?

1829
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Or unique.

1830
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I don't know, probably.

1831
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
But we could find a way to balance it.

1832
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I don't know.

1833
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I think it'd be cool.

1834
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
I think it'd be neat.

1835
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Yeah, I'm on board.

1836
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I'm going to throw you a quick one with something that's close to my heart.

1837
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
And that's map overlay.

1838
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And before you say immersion, I'd like to say that a lot of people will say,

1839
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
let us play the game we want to.

1840
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
What's the thoughts on map overlay moving forward?

1841
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Hmm.

1842
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
This is personal Adam thoughts, not company thoughts,

1843
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
because everybody has different opinions, I think.

1844
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
And we've talked about map overlay internally quite a bit.

1845
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I think map overlay, it's one of those where there's such obvious pros and cons.

1846
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
And I think different types of players really want to engage in different ways.

1847
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I personally am not completely against a map overlay being in the game,

1848
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
but I understand why there are people that feel strongly that, you know,

1849
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
we really don't want to try and make a game where you're looking at your map the whole time

1850
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:09,000
and not all of this beautiful world and art and things that we've created to try and immerse the player.

1851
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,000
And then they're so into the systems and the efficiency game that we pull them out of it.

1852
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:19,000
And I think it kind of goes back to kind of what you said of like, you know, ARPGs, we really want you to,

1853
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:28,000
we know it's an efficiency game, but we don't want it to feel that exposed all the time that you must feel pressure to do things perfectly all the time.

1854
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,000
And a map overlay pushes that pretty hard.

1855
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,000
So I see both sides.

1856
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I think I'm a little bit personally in favor of just having it because people want it.

1857
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,000
But I understand it changes the game pretty fundamentally for a lot of people.

1858
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,000
And there's a pressure there now.

1859
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
It's kind of like DPS meters in many games too, I would equate it to.

1860
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Like the moment you introduce that, you kind of can't go back and you've changed how people interact with your game forever.

1861
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:56,000
And so I, even if people want it, I see why it's a tough topic.

1862
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,000
We're actually doing pretty good on time.

1863
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
We're almost through the rapid fire.

1864
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
We've got a few more here and then we pretty much are GG out the way out the door here.

1865
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So ultimate button is something that gets brought up a lot.

1866
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
People have asked, can we get a separate button for the ultimate?

1867
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Yeah.

1868
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Maybe.

1869
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
I'll say, I'll explain the problem space of why.

1870
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Yeah.

1871
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:25,000
So when we're thinking about Diablo and why we don't have more extra buttons or like an ultimate button or whatever,

1872
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:34,000
is that we thought heavily and worked long and hard deciding the number of buttons that you're going to have total on your bar at all.

1873
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:41,000
And those buttons were determined by thinking of how many different actions do we want a player to worry about at any given time.

1874
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
And right now we have, you know, you have a Vage, you have Potion, you have your regular ones on your bar,

1875
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
and then your Core and your Basic, right?

1876
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
If you have a Basic.

1877
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Adding another button is something that we could do.

1878
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I mean, controller issues aside and making that feel good.

1879
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:01,000
It's a matter of how complex do we want to expect every single player to interact.

1880
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,000
And at the time at launching the game, we wrestled back and forth with this a lot.

1881
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:13,000
And at the time, our idea was we would rather have something like an evade button that really everybody can use and makes the game feel very different.

1882
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:18,000
And it's kind of like, this is very different than other RPGs, than a specific ultimate button.

1883
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:24,000
There's also would need to be a lot of rebalancing of ultimates when we fully expect people to have one versus that they can choose whether or not they do.

1884
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
That work we could do, I think.

1885
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:34,000
It's more of like, do I want to balance and design everything assuming a player has an ultimate in addition to all of their other skills?

1886
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
And what that means to how we have to change ultimates or do other things?

1887
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I think it's doable, but I don't know that I'm very excited about the prospect unless there's a very clear win.

1888
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Okay.

1889
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I can understand that.

1890
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
A couple of just fast ones.

1891
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I don't have to go in depth on just some transmog things.

1892
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,000
People are asking maybe a color wheel for transmogs as opposed to just like red, green, blue.

1893
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Any thoughts on adding like a color wheel?

1894
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Yeah, it seems cool.

1895
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
It's not my team, but yeah.

1896
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Non-horse mounts.

1897
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Pretty much all the mounts are horses.

1898
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Can we get like a maggot or anything other spider?

1899
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I think we should.

1900
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
And I wouldn't be surprised if we did it, but I'm not involved in those conversations.

1901
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,000
But I personally feel like it's a no-brainer.

1902
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Yeah, same.

1903
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Same.

1904
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I agree.

1905
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I'm glad we agree on that one.

1906
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Okay.

1907
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Wings.

1908
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Kind of controversial.

1909
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
But a million people ask me, wings.

1910
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Are we ever going to see wings in D-4?

1911
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Yeah, that's a little more controversial.

1912
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
I would say I don't know about the future.

1913
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I could explain a little bit of where we're at now.

1914
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I'm not even completely involved in this.

1915
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
This is a little bit of my opinion because I didn't make these decisions.

1916
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:42,000
But Return to Darkness was one of our big guiding philosophies when we were making D-4 up to launch.

1917
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:51,000
And this idea that, hey, this game is going back to kind of D-1, D-2 roots of being scary and a little more gruesome and dark and dreary.

1918
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:58,000
And we even tried, even with the combat, that's why we have Evade, is like you have to dodge attacks and really plan because this world is dangerous.

1919
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:07,000
In some ways, we've learned that players, you know, want to blast and they don't care as much as we maybe, like we over-indexed a little bit on it.

1920
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
But it is still something that we care about.

1921
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:18,000
So like now it's, does we, like before wings was kind of in that, it's making the game a little bit, it doesn't fit the vibe we're going for, but we've moved a bit.

1922
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
But have we moved enough that wings are okay now?

1923
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I don't know.

1924
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Fair enough.

1925
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
It's like, I think we're right there.

1926
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
I could see it being either way.

1927
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
But that just explains kind of how we got here.

1928
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Fair enough.

1929
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,000
I get that.

1930
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
We only got like three questions left here, really.

1931
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:36,000
So the last transmog related or cosmetic related question is, can we get cosmetics potentially for minions?

1932
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I know Ghazi probably would like this one.

1933
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I think it would be cool.

1934
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:49,000
It's a lot harder to do for minions than for players, though, or even like wings because you can have a million minions on your screen and how loud that is is a concern.

1935
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
But I don't think it's an impossibility.

1936
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I'd like to see it.

1937
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
I think it'd be cool.

1938
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Same with Druid, Transform, transmogs.

1939
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I think would be cool, but that's just my opinion.

1940
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
All right.

1941
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Go for it, Ghazi.

1942
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Speaking of being scary, what about a unicorn level?

1943
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Cow level.

1944
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Is that ever something that's going to happen?

1945
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Because we've all been hunting for it.

1946
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:11,000
A unicorn level?

1947
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,000
That sounds neat.

1948
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I don't know what you're talking about with the other one.

1949
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
There it is.

1950
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
And shout out to Rax.

1951
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Uber Tomb Lord win?

1952
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I think it'd be cool.

1953
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I'm down.

1954
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:25,000
I don't know.

1955
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Whatever people want to fight, we could make it.

1956
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:28,000
All right.

1957
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,000
And we pretty much are hitting the end of the time here.

1958
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I want to thank you for your time.

1959
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I will submit.

1960
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,000
There's a couple other bug reports that I'll just DM over as well and skip those ones.

1961
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
And we just hit our 45 minutes, so I appreciate the time.

1962
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Thanks for answering all the questions.

1963
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:49,000
And we actually managed to get through pretty much the entire list, including the rapid fire.

1964
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
So you've done good, Sadan.

1965
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Yeah, that's great.

1966
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I appreciate it.

1967
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Any last words or anything you want to say?

1968
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I would say, first, thanks to both of you for taking the time to talk to me.

1969
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Thank you.

1970
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
We really enjoy these conversations.

1971
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
I look forward to doing more.

1972
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:11,000
For everybody else, one of the things I'm really passionate about, first, go listen to that presentation that I talked about on Cursed Problems.

1973
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:17,000
And one of my goals with getting in front of people and talking with them, and I've done this ever since I started as a developer.

1974
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,000
You can go look at interviews with me years ago from Heroes.

1975
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:26,000
But I like having better discussions with you all and with players that are a little more informed.

1976
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,000
So as people get passionate and want to learn about game design, it's easy just to be like, hey, why don't you add this?

1977
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
And we can answer those questions.

1978
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:37,000
But I like more in-depth ones than we do on the team of like, hey, why does this work the way it does?

1979
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
And can we find a way to make it work and get what we want, right?

1980
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Like when you counter back at me with like the strongholds question, like can't we?

1981
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Okay, Adam, I listen to you.

1982
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I understand your problem space.

1983
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Now that I've thought about it, can we do this and why or why not?

1984
02:04:50,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Like that to me is a better discussion and a better culture, a better world, really, if I want to get sappy of like, you know, be informed when talking about things and care about it and think about it.

1985
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
And don't just blast like, hey, just do this, right?

1986
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't want to be a game dev either.

1987
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I'm not saying everyone has to be a game dev.

1988
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I just mean like if you care enough to really want to know, like, you know, think about it and have real discussions.

1989
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
So I want to be a force for that, I guess, in the community.

1990
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
And I think other people on our team do as well.

1991
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Thanks, man.

1992
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Yeah, but I really enjoyed the time.

1993
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
So enjoy talking with you both.

1994
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I enjoyed that conversation.

1995
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I appreciate you joining.

1996
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:33,000
It was actually nice seeing the thought process behind it and then like kind of in real time.

1997
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Because normally it's like you make a video, maybe you get a response about it or something.

1998
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
But it is kind of nice to see like in real time the feedback.

1999
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Because you're right, just during the very brief conversation about strong codes, like it did actually.

2000
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I'm like, oh, you know, it makes sense.

2001
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
It's a consumable design thing.

2002
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Kind of hard to turn into a repetitive experience.

2003
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
So thank you for opening up about that.

2004
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Guys, you got any last comments or anything you want to say?

2005
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Not really.

2006
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I mean, I know you're a minion lover.

2007
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:58,000
So I want to get in on a deep dive talk with you someday about that.

2008
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
We do that on stream on the Savern Talk someday as well.

2009
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Maybe we can someday.

2010
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
No, yeah.

2011
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
My roots are in RTS where I manage a million little units.

2012
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
And I love minion stuff and everything.

2013
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Sounds good, man.

2014
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Thanks for joining.

2015
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Appreciate it.

2016
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
All right.

2017
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Yeah, thank you both very much.

2018
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
We'll let you head on out the door here.

2019
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
We'll wrap up.

2020
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
And all right, we're going to cut back to the other screen and then cut the audio.

2021
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
And I will be back in just a moment, everybody.

2022
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Bye-bye.

2023
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Thank you.

2024
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Bye-bye.

2025
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Bye-bye.

2026
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Bye-bye.

2027
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Thank you.

2028
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Thank you.

2029
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Thank you.

2030
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Thank you.

2031
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Thank you.

2032
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Thank you.

2033
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Thank you.

2034
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Thank you.

2035
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Thank you.

2036
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Thank you.

2037
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Thank you.

2038
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Okay.

2039
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Option one.

2040
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:43,000
I'm gonna add a bunch of options in here.

2041
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I'll put a link and you guys can vote on it.

2042
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,000
It was great.

2043
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
It was good.

2044
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
It was mid.

2045
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
It was bad.

2046
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
And then it was horrible.

2047
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
So there's gonna be a variety of these.

2048
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Bing.

2049
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Launch that.

2050
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:59,000
And let's see what the feedback of it actually is.

2051
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
And I'm actually pretty satisfied myself personally.

2052
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I thought it went pretty decent.

2053
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
So I'm surprised we were able to get through all the questions.

2054
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:13,000
I will admit I was a little worried we were not gonna have enough time to get through all of the questions.

2055
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:18,000
But we kind of blasted through there at the end, which was nice.

2056
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Hopefully we didn't go too fast and then we were able to actually keep up with it here.

2057
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Okay.

2058
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Let me go ahead and grab.

2059
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
There's the straw poll.

2060
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Boom.

2061
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Throw that on screen.

2062
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Bang.

2063
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Okay.

2064
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Here you go.

2065
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,000
So I'm gonna put the links in the chat.

2066
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
There you go.

2067
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Go ahead and vote on how you feel about the interview.

2068
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
There you go.

2069
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Mostly positive response.

2070
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
About 80 or 90% of people didn't like it.

2071
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
I'm glad we spent the time we did going through the prep.

2072
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Yeah.

2073
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Yeah.

2074
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I thought Adam did a really good job explaining the philosophy behind it and like tackling the questions that we were kind of curious about.

2075
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Like he didn't shy away from the questions.

2076
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
There wasn't very many like, oh, I can't really answer that.

2077
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Like it was actually kind of like did his best to actually take a shot at him.

2078
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Which I'm glad for.

2079
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I was hoping it was going to be something like that.

2080
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I didn't want to be asking questions that weren't going to get anywhere.

2081
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Okay.

2082
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
That seems like pretty good reception.

2083
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Now interview the other interviewers about the interview.

2084
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Yeah.

2085
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Do we need interview-ception here?

2086
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Now we need Riker and Rax and we all just sit in a group interviewing each other about how we felt about each one of our interviews for the ultimate live stream react-ception.

2087
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I enjoyed the discussion on philosophy, etc.

2088
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Why bother otherwise?

2089
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I do enjoy actually hearing the thought process behind when they're developing the game itself.

2090
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Actually though, a round table before season four launch would be nice.

2091
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

2092
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Shout out to my boy Ghazi.

2093
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Also, let me put a link to Ghazi's channel if you're looking to watch the VOD itself.

2094
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:35,000
We will be posting just the cutout interview of that on Ghazi TV's channel as well.

2095
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
So I'm gonna have a link to that I'll put down below.

2096
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
There you go.

2097
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Otherwise, you can see it here in the live stream VODs both on Twitch and YouTube.

2098
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:54,000
You, Ghazi, Krip, Aspen, Go, Woody, Joe, and Rax, Go, Go, Go, Go.

2099
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Dude, that's a ton of people in a round table.

2100
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I hope everyone listens to Adam's feedback on what kind of questions asked for the next round of interviews.

2101
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,000
It is harder.

2102
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:10,000
I feel like it's harder than it seems to prepare questions that you think can actually get answers.

2103
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Because when you're asking them, you try to do things that are gonna open up the conversation and actually...

2104
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Because the point is you want to be able to hear, right?

2105
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:25,000
You want to actually be able to hear what people are saying or what they're thinking when they're developing the game.

2106
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,000
You don't just want to hear like, are charms coming to the game, yes or no?

2107
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Like you kind of do want to hear the thought process behind it.

2108
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
So you try to balance those with just getting factual responses as well.

2109
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:47,000
People are saying horrible or bad or just as so as in the chat.

2110
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:52,000
I mean, there's a pretty limited number of people that were being a problem in chat.

2111
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,000
I feel like everyone was actually pretty nice in chat for the most bit.

2112
02:12:55,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Call racks for general discussion.

2113
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,000
That is up to him.

2114
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
If he wants to, he can ring me.

2115
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Six hours of Asmongode reacting.

2116
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Yeah, you guys can catch this interview also in Asmongode's react for the next 12 hours maybe.

2117
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:25,000
What up Waffle Stomper.

2118
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Dude, that name.

2119
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Ghazi was good in this one?

2120
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Yeah, I thought so.

2121
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Ghazi had some good questions.

2122
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:39,000
The only critical thing I'd say about the interview is that I felt a bit rushed.

2123
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
That's fair because it actually was rushed.

2124
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:48,000
We did kind of have to move along the, we had to move along the questions.

2125
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
We couldn't, we couldn't sit on the topic for too long.

2126
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Even though I was enjoying the conversation personally around strongholds, for instance,

2127
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I did need to move the conversation along quicker.

2128
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,000
So we kind of had to, we had to cut it.

2129
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Because if each question is 15 minutes, we will have only got the first three,

2130
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
but we were able to get about 20 in.

2131
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
So I'll take it.

2132
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Are you posting on YouTube today or later?

2133
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
The VOD is currently being uploaded to a Google Drive,

2134
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,000
which Ghazi will upload on the channel that was linked.

2135
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
There's also the live stream VOD that I have today,

2136
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
but you will have to pick through it to find it.

2137
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
And we're going to, me and the editor are going to, after this live stream,

2138
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
record a recap video in which I do shorter synopsis.

2139
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
So if you don't want to watch a full 45 minutes,

2140
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
there'll be a recap video shortly after this stream ends.

2141
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:41,000
I'm going to sit down and record one with the editor in which will be like,

2142
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I asked this, this was the response and like paraphrase effectively.

2143
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
SSF coming.

2144
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I think that was the one that maybe perhaps we could receive as the most information leaked.

2145
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Maybe, I mean, he said, can't confirm anything, but we like it type of situation.

2146
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
So, um, SSF sounds like it could be coming. Yeah.

2147
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Wish for more backfiring on the devs, bad takes.

2148
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Not like adding one by under experience kill tree,

2149
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
cause players can't handle it.

2150
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Mistakes.

2151
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,000
I don't think it matters what I think about what somebody else is saying.

2152
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I think what matters is that you get to hear more questions

2153
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:34,000
related to what they think about questions you would ask if you had the chance.

2154
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
So I could be like, well, I think that's a dumb take.

2155
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
I think players can handle an ultimate button,

2156
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:44,000
but what do you as the viewer actually gain from me snapping back at him?

2157
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:51,000
You basically instead gaining something, you lose one additional question answer during that time.

2158
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:56,000
So I choose to not respond unless it's a critical point in which I was extremely curious.

2159
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,000
So I couldn't help myself asking about, for instance, the Uber strongholds.

2160
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,000
When we got into that conversation, um, outside of that,

2161
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I don't think it's really worth time, like arguing with people.

2162
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Cause I don't really think that I'm the one developing the game.

2163
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Now, am I?

2164
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:16,000
The job's to pull information out, not try to teach him the job that he's doing.

2165
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Right.

2166
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Which I mean, he, he's the one doing the job.

2167
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Not me.

2168
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
I didn't go to school for game dev.

2169
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
So I actually do listen to what he says.

2170
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Where's that poll?

2171
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
The poll is right here.

2172
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Oh, hold on.

2173
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
That's guys use a link to the channel.

2174
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Let me put this here.

2175
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
There's the poll.

2176
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Joe says,

2177
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Joe says,

2178
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Tons of people take every generator cause they don't earn skin the skill tree as it is.

2179
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Yeah.

2180
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
That's probably true.

2181
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I think D4, you have to realize, has a much wider audience than any of the previous Diablo games.

2182
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:11,000
But I don't think they, I don't think they necessarily will stop progression of something like that just because some people don't know how the skill tree works.

2183
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I'm sure that there will be continued progression.

2184
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:23,000
What was the name of the video he told us to go watch about the game dev?

2185
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
You have to back up to see it in the VOD.

2186
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
I don't actually remember the name of it.

2187
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Trickiest bit of interviewing is active listening and not worrying about your next question.

2188
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Took me a bit to stop doing that with my production brain.

2189
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Yeah.

2190
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:43,000
You have to like listen and be able to follow up in order to actually have a good conversation.

2191
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I agree that part can be difficult.

2192
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
There you go.

2193
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Jim has the link to the curse prompts and game design.

2194
02:17:50,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I'll link that on YouTube side of things too for the people that are curious over there.

2195
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Sounds like the PVP folks need to speak up more.

2196
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Yes, more of what we want.

2197
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:15,000
So it sounds like they haven't been hearing.

2198
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Yeah, I did ask for the PVP.

2199
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,000
I knew when I asked him that that half the people were going to be like,

2200
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,000
what a waste and stupid question for the people that don't give a fuck about PVP.

2201
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,000
But there's enough PVP players that like I wanted to get that one in there for you.

2202
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,000
I'm sorry that we weren't able to get like, well, this is the next game mode coming.

2203
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:35,000
But like, you know, you got what if you guys really do care about PVP,

2204
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
it sounds like they're not getting enough feedback about that.

2205
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:40,000
So you need to put feedback in for that.

2206
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,000
That's what it sounds like.

2207
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:52,000
What was the feature you personally would like to see come to D4 and why?

2208
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Just curious.

2209
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
That's a good question.

2210
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Well, since we're on the PVP topic, the thing that mainly comes to my head is,

2211
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:06,000
you know how in Lost Ark there is a PVP arena that's like 1v1v1 basically.

2212
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I think that that is pretty phenomenal.

2213
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I like that, like the elimination style.

2214
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,000
It'd be cool if you could create a character that's like level 100 maxed out gear separate from like your actual one

2215
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:20,000
and have only a PVP character that would go into a 1v1v1 arena.

2216
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,000
That would be pretty cool.

2217
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Or like a MOBA style, or not MOBA, but like a battle rite style where it drops you in.

2218
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
It's like Plunderstorm.

2219
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I think that would be pretty cool.

2220
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,000
But that's just because my brain's on PVP right now.

2221
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:41,000
How to submit feedback to Blizzard, their forms, Reddit posts, anywhere that stuff is heard, Discord.

2222
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Didn't mention mercenaries followers though.

2223
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Yeah, I think that one had been covered already.

2224
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
We did go into pets.

2225
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Yeah, balance issue is one problem with PVP as well, yeah.

2226
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Your thoughts on D4 adding a new class?

2227
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,000
I think people would love to see a new class.

2228
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I think that's pretty self-evident.

2229
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
A lot of people would love to see it.

2230
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:15,000
What about cow level answer he gave?

2231
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Like, he said exactly what I said they would say, which is effectively, what's a cow level?

2232
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
We have no idea.

2233
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Is the VOD available anywhere?

2234
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
The VOD is on YouTube as well as on Twitch.

2235
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
You can find it on both platforms.

2236
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Okay.

2237
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Alright.

2238
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Yeah.

2239
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
It's not playing stupid.

2240
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
That's the ongoing joke.

2241
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Like the...

2242
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Yeah, it's not plain stupid.

2243
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:47,000
That's the ongoing joke.

2244
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,000
So the cow level joke is an ongoing gag

2245
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:54,000
of basically you say, like, what's a cow level?

2246
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
And then they say, oh, well, the cow level is this.

2247
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
That's effectively how it goes.

2248
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
There is no cow level.

2249
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Yeah, exactly.

2250
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Okay.

2251
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,000
You're frankly alive with the Prime.

2252
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Thank you very much.

2253
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Okay, so shout out to all the people that watch this

2254
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,000
on Twitch as well as YouTube.

2255
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,000
I appreciate you guys.

2256
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
We'll probably do more YouTube live streams

2257
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
going in the future for the start of season four.

2258
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
If you have any interest in those, you can hit the bell.

2259
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
It will notify you when the live streams go live.

2260
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
They'll probably be right around the same time

2261
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,000
as we did this one today as well.

2262
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I appreciate all the people that showed up.

2263
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Pretty good amount of people that did show up today.

2264
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Looks like most people enjoyed the interview.

2265
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Thank you for all your questions and for helping tune the interview

2266
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,000
through the last 24 hours as we did the previous one.

2267
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Also, any questions on loadout?

2268
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
That was covered by Raxon's previous interview.

2269
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,000
So I'm going to wrap it up.

2270
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I'm going to go record a sort of highlights video

2271
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
talking about the recap of what we actually saw.

2272
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
And then from there, I will see you guys later.

2273
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Thanks for everything.

2274
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Appreciate you watching.

2275
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Have a wonderful day.

2276
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
And I'll see you on the recap video

2277
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
or on the next live stream.

2278
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Don't forget you can watch just the interview,

2279
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,000
raw cutout,

2280
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
on Gazi's channel as well.

2281
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Gazi TV on YouTube.

2282
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,000
That's about it.

2283
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:28,000
See y'all.

2284
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I'm going to run the outro.

2285
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:32,000
And I'll see you guys tomorrow.

2286
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
tomorrow.

2287
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Thank you.
