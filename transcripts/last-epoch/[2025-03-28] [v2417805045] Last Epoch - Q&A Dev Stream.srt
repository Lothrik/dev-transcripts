16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
as well because we are streaming in two places at once now and we do take questions from both so uh

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
yes don't worry questions from both uh will we ever get a co-op dev stream with the ehg team i i feel

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
like we've done this once or twice question mark i'm definitely down for it we've we've been planning

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
on on trying to incorporate more people into uh the devstream process in general um and once the once

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
the what do we get oh cool once the uh podcasts sessions are done for the uh for the stream i think

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
like maybe a few early streams in the season i'd like to get some guests on yeah we'll do some some

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
co-op stuff there some devs you know there's there's lots of people that i'd love to have on get some

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
fresh perspectives on things um different like art disciplines uh just other people who work on

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
design stuff or coding stuff or all sorts of people that would love to come on so we want to get more of those on for sure

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
uh mike real talk i haven't seen these streams in quite some months did you lose a lot of weight

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you look sharp thank you very much i did lose a lot of weight i lost a third of my body weight

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
uh in almost exactly a year now they started on april 1st last year

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
all right uh controller thanks yeah we're uh we are updating controller work um

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
um oh medic you know you know what's going on with the controller thanks for putting the names

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
there came that's why it's useful yes control updates are coming for season two um uh if you

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
haven't played with controller recently there's a ton of cool stuff happening with that um context and

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
specialization specific targeting functions for each skill that works so much better than than before

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
even just a simple just normal fireball being able to kite with it so nice like like just opening the

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
game at the very start on a new character and being able to orb walk is surprisingly something i didn't

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:15,000
think was as big a deal as it is oh thank the whole whole set where's give me that set we're picking up sets now

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
all right do you consider a hot dog a sandwich please elaborate your answer um

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
i'm gonna say no however i'm gonna say that a sandwich requires so if you look at the um

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
the like each side of an object of having starch or not in it a sandwich has starch on the on the top

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and bottom but a hot dog has has starch on on three sides um or like this three sides so so it's three

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
sides instead of two sides so it's a different class of food delivery it's more like a taco really

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
um

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
i think there's a podcast called hot dogs a sandwich isn't there

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
like some car trip i was on once had someone playing it i don't know it's a weird memory there

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
um all right uh does that mean no dead stream next friday is that just because peewee will be there

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
uh uh be an interview that day ah right i i skipped a week didn't i ah um we will decide what to do next

46
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
week i think uh because next week is launch day for them yeah next next week is launch day for them

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
uh i'll double check and get back to you

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
i think it's reasonable not to do a stream on poe launch day

49
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
i have fallen you know that means right

50
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
it is an early spoiler

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
as penance for my death

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
here we are uh here is a node for the new reworked sigils of hope which is now symbols of hope uh skill

53
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
tree and uh yeah a little little little little little bit in there

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:34,000
shove that to the bottom corner and keep moving because we're not done yet

55
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
it's a little 90 timeline i'm level 76 all right cool

56
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
but we're punching up a little bit we're punching up a little bit

57
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
all right any thoughts on torchlight infinite doing their release on april 17th too uh april is crowded um

58
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
it is it is very unfortunate and uh

59
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you know moving again is is is just craziness so i think uh i i'm not in charge of this in any way

60
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
uh but unless i hear otherwise we're sticking to the guns on it

the the the live action cowboy bebop um and the name always reminds me of that

81
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000

wondrous wondrous wondrous all right

88
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
has the team figured out what day they hope to get the patch notes out by uh we we have not unveiled

89
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the patch notes day yet um i i would assume that the uh the marketing team has a very good handle on

90
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
what day that's going to be um that sort of thing's planned out pretty far in advance usually

91
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
um and it had to get adjusted for the for shifting the release date but yeah it's i think that's a

92
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
pretty i i think that's that's that i don't know who i don't know what day it is or who it is or what

93
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
or any of those things

94
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:21,000
get back here you loot lizard

95
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
whoo

96
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
lots of candy

97
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
little ones

98
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
more questions more questions mike's gonna answer the questions stop playing your game

99
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
uh will element damage ever be affected by base damage ratio the the um the the added damage

100
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
scaling ratio so each each ability in case anyone doesn't know each ability has

101
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
uh a scaling ratio that added damage applies to it so um you get something like this and it's like

102
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
plus 90 melee damage that 90 melee damage applies differently to swipe than it would to say serpent

103
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
strike or upheaval or tempest strike and they all do differently

104
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
all aboard

105
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
i found it yeah that's that's that's like hype train rolling oh dj thank you very much

106
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that's that's big we're going we're rolling

107
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
no room thank you very much everybody that's that's five gifted subs whoo

108
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,000
we're cruising

109
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
just dumping everything this is before i started organizing mustache

110
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
like a heathen everything just gets dumped

111
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
i can't bear to drop it on the ground

112
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
all right will ailment damage ever be affected by the base damage ratio of a skill big hitting skills

113
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
are almost impossible to make into ailment builds and it would be really cool to actually have those

114
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
builds in the game um i don't have a specific yes no on this we're not doing we're not making

115
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
a change to this for season two it's something that we've discussed a few times um medic resub

116
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
thank you very much appreciate you that's three months in a row right there

117
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
also congrats to everyone who got one of the gifted ones too um

118
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
but yeah the uh whether or not this changes in the future i don't know it won't change in season

119
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
two i can tell you that much

120
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
all right what's the first build you're planning on running in season two i'm going hard seeker to

121
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
start i it's what i've been playing the most in testing and oh my goodness this is insane it

122
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
just keeps coming in the best way possible

123
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
uh jarsul is more even more that's five oh is this a ploy to distract me so that i die

124
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
it's brilliant because it's going to work

125
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
all right mike focus up runescape i never played runescape never got into it i think i was playing

126
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
age of empires at the time um yeah i just never never never got hooked on it

127
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:38,000
all right hi mike how are you doing i'm doing good thanks i'm actually having a really good day today

128
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
we had we had a design meeting this morning that went great i'm pumped on the stuff i saw it's gonna

129
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
be awesome um just you know we got got through another another uh lock for the patch it's it's

130
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the build stable right now i'm feeling really good having a great day uh anyway to the real

131
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
question will there be improvements on merchant skilled ui for example right now you can't search

132
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
for a triple exalt you have to search for results and then scroll hundreds of hundreds of pages

133
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
likewise will there be cof ui improvements sometimes it's hard figuring out uh where i want

134
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
to go next because the prophecies can't be sorted nor can we easily see what we have to do either

135
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
the panel or the echo map um yeah there's whoa that's a lot of damage um there's there's stuff in

136
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
the works for these things there's not a lot of changes for season two coming for either of those

137
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
directly um a lot of the ui works been being done on the new uh the new weaver ui the new echo ui the

138
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
new uh all the new stuff that's coming so there's not a ton of changes on the uh on on the

139
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
merchant's guild and see the circle of fortune ui but it is on the list and there are some changes

140
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
i think heavy heavy gets in a bunch mike 190 twitch twitch gets in a bunch there's there's there's

141
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
more subs coming through than i have ever seen this is just rolling just

142
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
i don't i don't even know what's going on here this is crazy this is crazy congrats

143
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:11,000
everyone's subbed at this point wild just wild okay let's let me see if i can answer something

144
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
favorably here uh do you guys find a way to make cosmetics available in true offline mode yet not

145
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
yet i'm sorry come on guys give me an easy question here uh will there be nodes that interact with heart

146
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:31,000
seeker and other skills trees um i don't think there's any nodes in other trees that directly

147
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
impact heart seeker there's there's items and there's nodes and heart seeker's too that impact

148
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:49,000
other skills uh i don't think so new player here why no hotkey to compare offhand item and second rings

149
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
aha yes this is this has been a problem for a long time and i'm very happy to say we have a fix for

150
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
it it's coming we've got offhand ring comparison we've got offhand comparison and off ring slot

151
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:08,000
comparison coming um i think it's uh okay but i don't remember which hockey it is but it's it's coming

152
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
it's on it's on the it's on its way it's happening uh the main reason why i didn't oh my god i just

153
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:24,000
oh my goodness what what is going on i can't i have no way of keeping up with this this is insane

oh oh nice

155
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
that's a max roll on that on a decent base too actually

156
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,000
that's not bad that's not bad uh all right well thank you very much for even more jarzul and

and an apple g72 i need to pull this window to a different spot so i can see it better how can i

159
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
reorganize this because i am just squinting it's like the farthest thing from me on a screen way

160
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
i can't even touch it uh

161
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
plutter oh that that's one that i guarantee if i find the capitalization on it it will make so much

162
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
more sense oh you're just rolling in it this is this is nuts charity charity it's all going it's all

163
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
going this way that way these guys all right one of the podcast streams fourth and eighth i think

164
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
they're on the uh

165
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
eighth and the 11th

166
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
i want to say back check me on that one

167
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:02,000
we've we've really got to get i've been saying this for like years now we've got to get a like custom

168
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
sound and uh sprite for for sub notifications and things like that

169
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:23,000
it thank you kane all right yes the eighth uh april 8th at 3 p.m and april 11th at 3 p.m central time

170
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
for both will be the

171
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the two more here they are boom right there

172
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:44,000
thank you kane much appreciated are there any plans to make legendaries drop randomly or will

173
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
they always just be craftable even if it's really rare it would be a big hype moment to see one drop

174
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
thoughts um i think it's one of those things where the variance is so high

175
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,000
um and you usually want to craft specific you want to combine specific things on there for it

176
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
i'd say it's unlikely that we'll be dropping them as pre-made legendaries anytime soon

177
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
um but it's it's definitely possible

178
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:29,000
more there's even more tails tail tails three

179
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
or triple oh 11 one of the two

180
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
depending on if we're talking base 10 or base 2.

181
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
here's here's a terrible joke for you uh why do programmers confuse halloween and christmas

182
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
because octal 31 is the same as decimal 25.

183
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,000
yeah december the base 10 and base 8 numbering never mind uh anyway charcel thank you for even more

184
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
uh that's that's i don't know how many is it like 25 this stream or something ridiculous

185
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
that's insane

186
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
that's insane

187
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
uh

188
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
thank you very much

189
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
uh okay uh any chance for a true berserk class possibly uh uh possibly ability using fists um

190
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
yeah i i think that's uh a theming that we've sort of dabbled in but not really like fully invested

191
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
in yet and i'd love to see it expanded

192
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
hello i'm a ballista enjoyer but can't seem to make ballista stand up on their own right they have

193
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
to be either exploded totems or raven combined with the raven being uh thalken being the main dps

194
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
any future plans to support ballistas as the main damage scaler they're definitely getting some love

195
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,000
um

196
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
uh there's some stuff in the future as well that that that's got some cool tech for them that we've that

197
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
we're introducing um

198
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
i i don't want to say like it's they're going to be a like top tier dps build or anything like that but

199
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
there's definitely some work we're doing on on ballistas recently for future stuff

200
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
oh

201
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
oh

202
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
little harbinger get this

203
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
uh what's your favorite unique oh great question

204
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
do i have an answer uh

205
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
uh

206
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
i like uniques that do cool stuff that's special uh i'm gonna say

207
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,000
hmm

208
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
honestly it's probably the beekeeper club

209
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
terrible cop-out answer i i don't know i i really like the

210
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
there's there's a couple new ones oh i can't talk about that one yet there's two new ones coming

211
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
that i really want to talk about right now that i will talk about soon and we go over itemization

212
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
um

213
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
existing ones in the game right now probably

214
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:45,000
i really like the squirrel helmet i really like this raptor weapon too maybe it's just i'm wearing it right now

215
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
the new the new the new relic that we've that we've revealed as a boss drop from uber yeah

216
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
uh i just say david harvard's unique because yeah i mean

217
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
get it getting to getting to talk to david harvard about this was pretty crazy so yeah that's that's up there for sure too

218
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
all right does snow crash node in earthquake create larger or small large or small avalanche boulders

219
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
oh i definitely know what that node does off the top of my head

220
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
earthquake mess at lunch

221
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
snow crash

222
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
uh those will be

223
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
that's the base those those will be big ones

224
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:04,000
those those should be big ones because it because it references the base uh the base skill tree

225
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
i mean just allocate it and see what it does

226
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
if i was if i had the ability unlocked i would check it for you right now

227
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:29,000
next question aside from sentinel slash heart seeker what class spec is going to have something new and

228
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
cool you're looking forward to all of them um

229
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,000
um

230
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
most most of that most of it comes around like specific uniques and new uh

231
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
things you can do that way but yeah

232
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
all of them really something new for everybody

233
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:04,000
all right skill and class design question any ideas or plans on expanding the min mix and

234
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
matching for elements on skills i love the idea of the us machinations but having a problems in

235
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
end game yeah it's it's a tricky thing because there's so much natural synergy

236
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
in getting similar elements together because when you have increased effects that target a specific

237
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
element you can make them be a little bit stronger um it's it's kind of like that give and take of

238
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
you're getting access by by mixing your elements you're getting access to new effects and new uh

239
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
new things that you can trigger new like debuffs and there's there's all sorts of like little extra

240
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
secondary things you get access to by by mixing in a second element um but then you get the reduced

241
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
effectiveness of your damage increases and things like that so it's a bit of a trade-off there um

242
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
it's kind of i'd kind of liken it to adding another color into your deck and like a magic or

243
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:01,000
something like that and um we do we do try to put conversions into skills when there's going to be

244
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
specific thematically appropriate like uh connections specifically for that so you can still have

245
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
so you can use two abilities together that should be play nice together um

246
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
but still get the full benefits from damage but if you really want split theming we tried to put that on

247
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
on like root master as an example of something that would would function better

248
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
getting bonuses from mix and matching elements

249
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,000
all right

250
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
uh i have seen a 3d printer in your background previously yes any possibility of getting some

251
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
iconic in-game assets in a printable format for fan art purposes uh i mean i'd love to

252
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,000
do i have uh i've taken a couple objects from from game files and and tried to convert them to 3d printable

253
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:02,000
um i'm moderately successful on a couple of them um i would i would love to have like a little

254
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
library of printable things that people could could download and print out and things like that

255
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
that would be really cool um so i guess no plans but i love the idea

256
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
we can we survive just standing in this i think so

257
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
nailed it

258
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:42,000
can you get more information about putting lp back on items that you previously teased back on items

259
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
uh we're not adding a way to put lp back on i well the

260
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
um

261
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the egg that's already in the game is the only way to add lp to an item that doesn't have lp on it

262
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
uh i think that's true

263
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
we'll go through uh one of the upcoming podcasts we're gonna focus on itemization

264
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
uh we'll go on a deep dive on all of the things like this i i i i think i know what you're asking

265
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
about um and i can't really answer the question without giving more away than i'm supposed to give

266
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:35,000
away uh but we will talk about this uh pre-patch notes and uh you'll you'll get some some some

267
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
some good solid info on this i promise don't worry i think this is asking about because we've

268
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
we've teased that there's going to be some system in the game to alleviate the feels bad moments of

269
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
slamming an item and uh not getting the thing you were looking for

270
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
i think that's what this is asking about

271
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
but it's gonna be it's gonna be really good it's gonna be really real good uh will we get to see

272
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
what the new quiver that you teased a while ago does in one of the podcasts or not i will

273
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
make a request for that for yes showing that off um

274
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:25,000
i don't i don't see why i don't see why not what do we get just some mana this is what we

275
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
we put in the egg not not exactly uh top tier

276
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
it's fine

277
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
i mean it's nice stats and everything but

278
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
i don't know

279
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:55,000
oh my goodness how my my face i didn't know i was asking for the face breaking treatment

280
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
i mean because there's there's i i guess i'm wrong like there's a legendary that just dropped right

281
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
there that i had nothing to do with it being created it just dropped right like i guess i kind

282
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
i did because i empowered it but so maybe we do dropped legendaries maybe i'm just wrong

283
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
are there any big changes coming to the shaman skill tree or more itemization to help expand the

284
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
builds i'm more in the itemization category there's some changes coming to some of the skill trees but

285
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
i'd say more focused in the itemization side of things uh what do you think about crossover skins

286
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
with lord of the rings or arthur's for forge guards i mean i i love the idea um i i don't i don't know

287
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
if it's the sort of thing that either of those franchises would find uh appealing given the

288
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
volume difference in reach

289
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:03,000
lord of the rings and wow are significantly bigger than we are

290
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the third lord of the rings movie i think is the the biggest oscar sweep ever where they've um of

291
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
any time a movie has been nominated and or won all of its nominations lord of the rings had the most

292
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
nominations for movies that won all of their nominations i think that's what the stat is

293
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
all right are we getting buffs to endurance threshold affixes in general yeah there's um

294
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
there's there's some sort of just general endurance buffs that are coming

295
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
uh there is some support to electrify in healing hands yes and we know that most of electrify support

296
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
is coming for lightning skills specifically holy lightning skills just a little interjection

297
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
so is there lightning conversion for healing hands um

298
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
i don't know if that made it into season two or not we are planning either for season two or beyond

299
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
um more lightning support in holy hands healing hands holy hands healing hands

300
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
uh will the weaver this is the problem i get working on things in the future is i don't

301
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
remember what's actually coming this season and next season

302
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
gets all jumbled up into one

303
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
all right will the weaver faction have their own pinnacle boss encounter uh not in the same way that

304
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
uh not in the same way that abiroth is to forgotten knights

305
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:53,000
like kind of because is that is that more is that more my goodness um like there is the hardest thing

306
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:01,000
to do in the game gets accessed through weaver faction stuff um but it's more thematically tied to

307
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:11,000
forgotten knights so kind of uh since unlocking tears in merchant skill distorts the price of the best

308
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
gear uh since few people unlock later tears is there any plans on a rework example trading costs

309
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
as gold as uh friction and shards and runes as their currency used to buy and sell unlocking tears

310
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
reduce gold effect friction costs um there this is this is a concern um that we've been talking about

311
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
we do have a solution planned for it for the future um it's going to be a little bit different but uh

312
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
than what you're suggesting here but like because it's not done yet we're very welcome to suggestions

313
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
on it so if you do have a specific idea that you'd like this to consider please head on over to the

314
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
suggestions uh channels on our discord uh forums any of the places we take suggestions from

315
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and we can incorporate that when we start implementing it but we do have some adjustments for that plant

316
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,000
let's let's let's get a little i thought i was gonna die sooner here's a weaver's node here's a node from the weaver's will tree

317
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
weaver's will tree the weaver's tree

318
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:42,000
this is another one of the like style of things that we're doing um yeah we're trying to give you

319
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
this is what we've been talking about but more control over more influence over what type of

320
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
um what type of things you're doing in the end game when you're playing what sorts of things are

321
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
you are you wanting to see more of trying to give you tools to get more of those things you want to see more of

322
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
all right any chance we get an option to hide multiple item types in a single loot filter argument

323
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
with 1.2 season 2 uh example belt subtype and chest subtypes uh

324
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:22,000
no that's not happening in season 2 uh we're combining something else though

325
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
but something else we're doing to combine two rules into one to make it a little bit easier to

326
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
to free up a couple rule slots for people because we're not adding more rule slots

327
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
um but we are trying to free up some of them

328
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
uh this one

329
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
this one yes

330
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
let's try it let's try it try it

331
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and of course there's spires spires are getting reworked pumped on the spire rework yeah spire

332
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
rework is gonna be great

333
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
i had a moment of like have i not even touched this mage's health

334
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
this exiled mage

335
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
uh room of research

336
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
hardly knew ye

337
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
uh when is frozen enemies

338
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
uh when is frozen enemies shatter like in d2p are you gonna come oh yeah we're working on it

339
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
working on it because yeah

340
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
that is that is necessary isn't it i don't mean this facetiously or joking like yeah i agree

341
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
because because it because it is really sweet

342
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
the visual feeling uh there's there's some

343
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
was it like the narnia movies or something

344
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
it was like a really visceral like ice shattering moment in a movie i saw a while ago that was

345
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
i can see it i don't know what it's from anyways i want that

346
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
uh are you planning on making monoliths longer right now i feel like i am spending more

347
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
time sorting loot between them actually slaying monsters yeah some of the um so like so the

348
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
cemeteries are fairly big um so yeah some of these the new echoes will be some of them will

349
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
be bigger some of them will be smaller um

350
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
um

351
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
yeah there's a few options in there

352
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
oh nice nice added damage there

353
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
thank you very much master sword that is 47 months in a row my goodness next month's a big one

354
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
one

355
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
you look we got to start commemorating these huge ones somehow nutty nutty love it uh will there be any

356
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
change or updates to the graphics setting options uh any change at all i think so

357
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:19,000
there's a bunch of changes that happen to the settings panel

358
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,000
i should be in an easier space so i'm not even to actually not die uh how many uh new big bad

359
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
bosses being put into the new season a small handful

360
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
when season two starts can we get some sort of skip or factions like we do for alts now

361
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
uh first first characters on fresh loads will have to play through the game normally and get to the

362
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
uh get to the factions normally and and unlock them in the storyline where they're supposed to be

363
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
like it's it's a lot of power to to unlock them early

364
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
and the experience game that you're getting early on in the game is so small that it doesn't make much

365
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
difference as far as like leveling them up early or anything like that

366
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:33,000
right any updates for minion survivability uh i mean

367
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
dots they'll be much they'll be more resilient to dots in general

368
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
so yeah there's also like individual stuff for lots of different minions

369
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
uh are you ever gonna make more co-op dungeons or even something like wow raids

370
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
ever is a long time ever is a long time we don't have any plans and season two won't have any

371
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
um and i think we're getting to the point where we have a like substantial amount of content where

372
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
um adding something like this is much more viable than it used to be i think there was probably a

373
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
problem in the past where uh we didn't have enough stuff to do enough activities that if we said

374
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
hey here's here's here's dev time here's resources we put into making a um a specific

375
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
thing like a a content that requires minimum two people everyone who plays solo or just doesn't have

376
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
any friends to play with or doesn't want to play with anyone else or you know like for whatever

377
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
reason they're playing solo um is just like it's just content they just like can't do it's just not

378
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
available to them even as they even if they want about how much they wanted it's not there for them

379
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and it's i think that's something that we wanted to avoid spending too much time on in the past

380
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:59,000
but we are getting i think to a more reasonable position of content where if like say we had 10

381
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
activities and one of them was uh co-op only that's that's a very different ratio than having 20

382
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:14,000
activities and one of them being couple you know like it's um it's all about that that that activity

383
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
ratio um i think after season two we're gonna be a much better place i don't know if it's enough or

384
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,000
not but uh it's a it's a note nothing for now but who knows what the future will bring situation

385
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
i guess i'm supposed to know there's another point

386
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:48,000
all right i i will say that there's i've had some uh there's been some boss design meetings that uh or

387
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
ideas that have been i've seen that have required multiple people that i've really liked the ideas

388
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
behind so i would love to try it just personal note all right what new elements are being added to

389
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
these sentinel skills like conversions new conversions a lot of new void conversions getting added in um

390
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
sub skills are getting new conversions uh mostly fire and lightning stuff

391
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and void stuff but we're not we're not adding in like a new element into sentinel package like we're

392
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
not adding cold stuff into sentinel heavily we're not adding necrotic stuff into sentinel heavily um yeah

393
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
are you now chilling for two weeks what's the team doing no we're not chilling for two weeks we are

394
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
so we're in a stage now where the we're like content locked um and anything that's gonna go into

395
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
we still still lots of work to do um so a lot of it is just testing and polishing right now where

396
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
we're like playing playing the game as much as we can internally just making sure we're catching little

397
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:00,000
annoyance points and little bugs and things where it's like really low risk just feel good fixes um

398
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
that we can get in if they're if they're like blockers we'll try and make sure they're stable enough

399
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
to push in for the actual launch build if they're uh just nice to have stuff we'll get them in a hot

400
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
fix early on in the first few days you know that sort of stuff so like we are the stuff you see in

401
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
in a lot of the hot fixes that will come out in the first few days um will be stuff that we're working

402
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:34,000
on now it doesn't stop it comes it calms down a bit though it calms down a bit which is really nice

403
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:47,000
i knew i was standing outside that no problem

404
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
oh i thought i was gonna answer a bunch of questions thought i was saved took my hands off the keyboard and mouse

405
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
oh so good oh i am that that that serves me right perfectly

406
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
oh

407
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
how do we unlock the secret lizard level that doesn't look like anything to me

408
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
uh if symbols of hope is now casted automatically how will orient seal interact with the skill it

409
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
increases the rate that it casts at um so you it increases the the auto cast frequency

410
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
unwavering fate doesn't scale with amount of symbols then

411
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
definitely not opening this image back up so i can read what it actually says

412
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
activating symbols now heals you for a portion of your maximum health

413
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
uh it doesn't look like it does but

414
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
i would expect it to maybe it may not scale with the number of symbols

415
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
the way the node's written it doesn't scale but i would have to check to make sure that's

416
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
how it actually functions to be sure

417
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:24,000
let's go get that unique up there uh any chance a minion skill like raise specter and peewee oh my

418
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:32,000
gosh having like we're talking about the like like clones right like having copies of existing of

419
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,000
enemies as minions like uh like d2 revive and um we've we've talked about this a few times internally

420
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:47,000
we've we've batted around the idea a little bit um the way that our enemy abilities and enemy systems

421
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:54,000
are set up it's it's a very tricky thing to do um and we're not jumping on something like that just

422
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,000
yet we've we've batted this idea around a few times though and things that get batted around come back

423
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:10,000
usually at least i hope so all right with the stash taps things tabs lag that happens from time to

424
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
time especially when one character has a lot will be optimized yes coming up you can hold your breath

425
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
on this no a couple weeks still isn't it uh more search and sorting function not much right now but

426
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:30,000
it's something we're working on uh may have missed it in the interviews do set shards need the same base

427
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
as it was taken from or can i uh take that meteor it is now electric and throw it on a shield instead

428
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
of a staff sorry for the names that's a bit of a drones um it does require the same base type it

429
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:47,000
does not require the same subtype so for example um let's say we had oh let's say this was a set item

430
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
um and it was because it's on a great wood coat and that's the subtype is a great wood coat

431
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
um you could pull the shard off and put it onto any primalist body armor it would not be required to be a

432
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
a um specifically a great wood coat so the it's like this like this is required to be a one-handed sword

433
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:12,000
not necessarily to be a serrated tooth um which is confusing because it's a specific one for this

434
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,000
item it's a bad example um but yes it is required to still be a staff so you can only use um

435
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
lightning meteor when you're wielding a staff specifically

436
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,000
um assuming that assuming that that is the mod that gets pulled from the item

437
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
big big asterisk there

438
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:50,000
because we haven't unveiled which affixes are being taken from each enemy oh thank you very

439
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
much we've got another sub

440
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:59,000
i'm gonna ruin this name and i apologize now

441
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
uh second tabula

442
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
it's probably it's probably there's capitalizations there i swear

443
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
and i'm gonna i'm gonna see it and be like that makes so much more sense

444
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,000
i can't find it i'm sorry i've ruined it everything thank you very much for the sub appreciate it

445
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
uh next question why don't you choose more skills and uniques faster

446
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
takes a long time to make them the short answer

447
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:46,000
uh ggg is putting more than 100 uniques and support gems plus 25 skills in three months 12 months

448
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
uh in in nine months you've only introduced one new skill and it's coming next patch

449
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
all right i think this is two questions in one it is two questions in one i it takes a long time

450
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
we're adding stuff as fast as we can um there's advantages and disadvantages to both where skill

451
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
systems are set up for speed in different situations um

452
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
i would argue they've got a much i don't know i don't have a good i don't have a good like

453
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
this is the difference in workflow that i can call to because i've

454
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
knew what their workflow looks like um

455
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
but yeah they're adding a whole lot

456
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
i still help you on that don't hit that

457
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
connected in thank you for the gifted sub appreciate you all right next question here

458
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
will ailment damage ever be good for big hitting skills possibly um and like some big hitting skills

459
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
have lots of individual hits anyways and those ones it's really good for as well

460
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
um base damage ratio let's get we already answered this question

461
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
all right we are 45 minutes behind 35 minutes behind

462
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
all right any plans to show item filter colors to items within the inventory we

463
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
don't really have the option for this at the moment um it is something that we're trying to

464
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
get a good solution for though helmets and body armor the weaver will come helmets and

465
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
body armor with weavers will come anytime soon it's on the list

466
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,000
oh

467
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
i forgot to the last one too

468
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
all right here's here's a little a little little sneak peek

469
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,000
uh this is the i i talked about this yesterday i just drew on the screen it looked terrible so this

470
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:08,000
is what it actually looks like um we are adding a corruption display to uh the monolith map panel

471
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
so you will be able to at a glance tell which timelines are at which corruption

472
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:22,000
uh and yes these are definitely legit achieved corruption numbers that were not manually typed in

473
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
at all i promise

474
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
thanks jesson

475
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
all right the set item crafting is one of the things i'm looking forward to the most me too

476
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
are there any specific set bonuses that required an overhaul that you're looking forward to playing with

477
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,000
no a couple of them required minor tweaks we like we nudged a few numbers up and things like that

478
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
but there weren't any that were like oh this one needs to be just changed completely i don't think

479
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
yeah there were there were like there was a few base affixes we changed

480
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
like base item things we changed there wasn't a ton of changes we made to most of them

481
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
um a few number tweaks here and there one i think affix got switched out completely

482
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
but you know for the most part set items are relatively they'll be pretty familiar the items

483
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:18,000
themselves

484
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
all right well we see procedurally generated general procedural generation used in the campaign

485
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
slash mono maps not talking about side areas uh it is something that we are looking to expand this

486
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:38,000
system into the um uh the the system we're starting off with in just the tombs and the

487
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
cemeteries is like it's the first time we're using it we we got it in in time to make this work and it's

488
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
we're gonna learn a lot from the implementation here and then we're gonna push that out to other

489
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,000
parts of the game uh as it is useful and it's going to be very useful uh tour spear thank you very

490
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
much for the sub appreciate it also yeah if you have a question please put our last epoch game in

491
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
the question so i see it in chat um i know i'm really far behind i apologize i'm answering them

492
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,000
quickly if if i can get through all these i will do my best we're only seven pages behind on this

493
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
this document uh that's quite far behind whoops

494
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
all right might need to rapid fire some of these i would just look look at look at my shiny raptors and

495
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
and helmet look how pretty yeah did we get it oh we got we got my bite so this little little

496
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:40,000
easter egg uh every minion in the game oh most minion types in the game have uh specific names they can

497
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:48,000
randomly be assigned um so raptors one of them is bite bite mr fibble thank you for the 16 months

498
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
appreciate you all right have the team at each you considered making some end game combined affixes to

499
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
help with difficulty gearing in the end game compared to legendary crafting like fire damage

500
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:07,000
plus fire resistance or health plus armor um yes you're gonna see some new affixes available on

501
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
items that didn't have them available before through set items now um so there's some cool stuff like that

502
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
there which is sweet are you able to show us was the in action i'm not the client i'm on does not have

503
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
wasdi available i'm sorry it does not uh it's it's it's not a huge it is a beta system still it feels

504
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
great for people who really want wasd in the game um the like it doesn't add new functionality to your

505
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:39,000
abilities so like what you can do is the same on keyboard and mouse and wasdy uh is there any is

506
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
there going to be mechanical interaction changes to main damage skills like a racing strike and

507
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
forge strike apart from the numerical changes that should offset the vr rework yes uh will the new

508
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
faction bring an alternate method to leveling weaver pieces yes some builds can't support taking off key

509
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
pieces of the weaver in that slot yes there's a new rune that does this uh will there be any changes to

510
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:07,000
prophecies yes one of the biggest pains is not having high high level base types able to be targeted

511
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:14,000
only some bases are offered um i can't speak to this specific change off the top of my head but we

512
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
are making changes to some prophecies yes uh thank you very much

513
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
another name i'm going to butcher and i apologize now

514
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:35,000
that that has definitely got some capitals in there doesn't it uh plots's runder hintern

515
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,000
i wish i was better at this this is like the i wish i could just like practice i should just

516
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
go hang out in random streams and just practice saying people's names to myself out loud

517
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
is that something that people do

518
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,000
all right uh hi mike love the game have season two hi me too uh when i use evade often he's jumping

519
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
me back to where i evaded from is this a known issue or just me there are this is something that i have

520
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:12,000
seen reports of um i i do not know i i wish i had a yes i guarantee this has been fixed i i've never

521
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
experienced this myself um but i know it was big enough and prominent enough that i know people were

522
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,000
working on it at least it'll be in the patch notes if it's if it's fixed i hope it is if anyone is

523
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
listening that did fix this that knows please let me know all right hi mike how do you enjoy oh hi john

524
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
how do you enjoy working on last epoch i love it um and not just because it's my boss asking me this

525
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
yes fantastic it's one of those jobs that you kind of think about as a kid and you're like

526
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
haha wouldn't that be cool and then it happens and you're like yep definitely real

527
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:59,000
all right in the upcoming season the sentinel can hold a two-handed weapon with a shield this

528
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
does also mean a two-handed weapon and an off-handed sword can be used at the same time no it is very

529
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:12,000
explicit in the wording uh you can use a non-staff two-handed weapon in your main hand and a shield

530
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
in your offhand and it has to be specifically that combination so it is fairly narrow it is spear two-handed

531
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:25,000
axe two-handed sword two-handed mace uh one of those four items and a shield no catalyst no quiver

532
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
no bow no staff no wand

533
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:41,000
no scepter

534
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
love the meteor one all right we know forge guard gets a pinnacle passive node for two

535
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
mana shield plus shield at the same time our vk and paladin getting pinnacle passives too uh

536
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
there's some shakeups in the trees

537
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
do i know where these nodes are off the top of my head i don't know where the nodes are on the top of my

538
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:15,000
head

539
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
i don't think i don't think they're specifically at the top necessarily it doesn't mean they're any less

540
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,000
awesome though

541
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
so some of the some of the best nodes are near the bottom of the tree

542
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
like that a void knight one that just scales everything based on the number of points you

543
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
have invested in the tree so good uh hello uh there hello there just want to say adding

544
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
uh price checking to the inventory is the way torchlight infinite does it would help a lot i

545
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
presume price checking is the most annoying thing in fortune's guild at the moment yeah that would be

546
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
so nice to have price checking in the inventory oh my god it'd be great

547
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
uh anyway we can purchase or earn a second stash chest reward for beating eyebrows for example

548
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,000
uh like are you running out of your 200 stash tabs is not enough is that what i'm hearing

549
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
um we don't have any plans to to to crank that up even higher but

550
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
you know if we if there's if there's a really good need for it we can consider it we are pulling um

551
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:31,000
um we are pulling keys out of your stash so you'll have a little bit more rooms uh freed up for next season

552
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,000
or is this

553
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:55,000
are you asking on earning a second reward drop for the kill

554
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:05,000
oh you can uh respond and i'll try and find you in chat if this is asking about a second if it's

555
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
if it's a second reward for the kill at like for one kill we don't have that planned i don't think

556
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
that's what it's asking maybe though i love that

557
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,000
all right

558
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:33,000
i just left the name here very very mr ben diesel asks love the name uh what are your thoughts on

559
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
bringing seasonal uniques to the game that are built defining for that season like having a unique

560
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
that turns fireball into a void ball that spins around your uh your ball lighting i think that um

561
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
removing an item from the game that's a tough one

562
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
so my my initial reaction is i love the idea i think it'd be great i i think i would really

563
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
enjoy something like that personally my second reaction is like how well would that go over

564
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
ah i don't think that would go over i think either the item ends up being something people don't like

565
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
and therefore is inconsequential it doesn't matter or something people really like and are sad when it

566
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,000
goes away

567
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
i don't know maybe if it was like always scheduled to turn into something else or something

568
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
and then like depending on what happened in the season some like community effort it like changed

569
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
one of three outcomes or something i feel like there have to be something like that predetermined

570
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,000
i don't know

571
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
looks like we may have got a reply on the previous question already that'd be sweet

572
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
oh no longer in chat sorry bud

573
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
here's an item i love talking about uniques that i love

574
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
i love this unique because it does cool stuff to know the unique does

575
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
really like this unique all right is sentinel's passive tree getting a complete rework not a complete rework now

576
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
uh just about half the passes will change uh i don't have a fixed number sorry um

577
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:25,000
how much better will it be in comparison to what it is now so subjective uh

578
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
at least one better

579
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
sorry uh what is the design direction for shaman currently it seems torn between three different

580
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
archetypes yeah

581
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:45,000
it does it does have access to a fair few things what's the third i guess the spellcasting stuff

582
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
i don't know i always i always feel spellcasting stuff kind of bleeds into druid a bit

583
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
uh this is like where we tried to put it but shapeshifting is so prominent there that it's

584
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
uh it's kind of taken over a bit um

585
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:15,000
it's getting that mix of the my personal uh like touchstone base for a shaman archetype is a wow shaman

586
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:22,000
um specifically enhance shaman is what i played ah well then i switched to healing for a long time but

587
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:29,000
apart from healing um like an enhanced shaman i feel like was a lot of fun to level as and and getting a lot of the a lot of the totems are

588
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
end up being just kind of like buffs and you're basically just a sort of an alternate melee character

589
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
i don't know if that's a bad thing

590
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:50,000
hey you got an lp on that that's nice

591
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
the zerk kicking in strong

592
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
i think we're gonna see shaman lean into totems uh and melee a lot more

593
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:16,000
how much love is hammer throw getting the new sentinel stuff i'm sorry i don't really have a

594
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
lot of good specifics for like hey this node's getting buffed this much or or like this this

595
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
specific archetype's getting this much love and this one's getting buffed more than that one or something

596
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:33,000
like that uh there's uh some feel and functionality stuff we just tweaked on on hammer throw uh

597
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
uh and i know some new functionality we just added

598
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
but all the specifics i can go into uh can you share anything on other char on the other charm we

599
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:52,000
don't know about uh it'll be it's an either or thing so you'll be picking that if you want to go

600
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
through the dungeon itself and enhance the dungeon experience

601
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:07,000
so it is an either or option that might be new info

602
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
oh what's the chance of us getting a crossover with stranger things since david however is a huge fan

603
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:23,000
he brings uh vekna as a boss we could have to kill i mean i i'd love to once once again that's like that's

604
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
dnd vekna's dnd right

605
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
someone tell me i'm not crazy here

606
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
that's not strange things specifically that's that's wizards isn't it

607
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
yes i'm gonna confirm that's wizards okay cool um

608
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:53,000
i i i same answers for i'd love to uh i think it'd be incredible and amazing all these sorts of

609
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,000
like dream come true moments but like i don't see the uh i don't see the appeal from their side of

610
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
things as much so i i'd say it'd be a hard fought a hard fought thing to get

611
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
you know like when um

612
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
it's this it's this it's kind of a bad example because it's the same owner of the ip

613
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
but when like magic did uh i guess lord of the rings crossover there we go it's it's because they're both

614
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
so huge you know like lord of the rings gets a bump from magic and magic gets a bump from lord of

615
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
the rings so it's like they they help each other none of them really get a huge bump from us

616
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
one day one day we will have a grand enough game that they will relish the opportunity

617
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:54,000
dead cells got a castle of any crossover that's cool i did not know that i was just just trying

618
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:05,000
out dead cells recently love it uh regarding balancing does the patch include any general

619
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:13,000
balance pass on skills not necessarily sentinel dated oh yeah oh yeah lots so there's um more

620
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,000
mechanical heavy things done to sentinel than the other classes but the other classes definitely have

621
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
you know like if there's if there's certain nodes that are just like going completely unused and

622
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
everyone's like oh what's the point of this you know like we'll look to try and buff a little bit

623
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
or if there's nodes that are like ubiquitous and completely overpowered because they're just like

624
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
one point wonders that take your defenses into the stratosphere then they're getting nerfed you know

625
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:43,000
things like that so we're um we are trying to give more viable options across the board

626
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,000
still just one

627
01:08:46,000 --> 01:09:03,000
there's a lot going on in there it doesn't feel safe at all

628
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:10,000
i should really have a stricter loot filter

629
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,000
will minion necro and beastmaster get any better rework and second what do lizard what will lizard

630
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:29,000
tail do um i'd say necro and beastmaster will be a bigger focus uh for us next season than this season

631
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
um there's still some stuff in there for them for sure but uh i would expect to see more later

632
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
um there is there is a very there is one necro build that i can tell you will be very powerful

633
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
uh specifically

634
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
at least i shouldn't say that much confidence i i have a feeling there'll be a really good necro build

635
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
uh

636
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
uh

637
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
pretty boss

638
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
number six thank you for the sub appreciate it

639
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
uh

640
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
and i have no idea what lizard tails are i don't know what you're talking about no clue uh when

641
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
developing new skills and balance changes are there things that you think that could be extremely

642
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
overpowered but only with very specific scenarios that you leave in the game because you don't

643
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,000
think anyone will find them hmm no uh i i fully expect anything that we found you to find too

644
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
i i don't think there's a world where we can like sneak things like that into the game

645
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:45,000
i think that yeah you you all are so good at finding

646
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
like very strong combinations that i don't think there's a way we can we would

647
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,000
yeah

648
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
uh built not bought we are looking at youtube chat i promise you

649
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,000
i'm not looking at it directly but i'm hardly looking at twitch chat directly either i've seen

650
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
like three messages from it but kane is pulling questions from both i am just really far behind

651
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:23,000
i've got a document with seven pages of questions on it that i am uh rolling through at 10.5 font

652
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
that i'm rolling through as fast as i can here oh here here's what we're going to do we are going to take

653
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
a gameplay break

654
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:47,000
i'm just going to answer rapid fire questions here uh when developing new skills and balance

655
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
changes are though answer that uh what are some skills some types of skills you personally love

656
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
to see in the game you can pull from other games or something you think of on your own i mean this

657
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:02,000
this is tricky because i'm on the skill design team so like the things that i'd really love to see

658
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:12,000
uh frequently eventually end up in the game um i'd really like to see i'd really like to see some

659
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,000
abilities that are um not possible right now because of some weapons that we don't have in the game so

660
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,000
like uh fist weapons or like crossbows um you know like things like that where there's like weapons

661
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
types that we don't really have in the game yet um

662
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
um that i'd like to see some thematic skills that go with those really nicely

663
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
but i don't really want to say them because i i'm pitching them right now uh what are some types of

664
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
skills you'd personally love to say is that uh any plans to add uniques to interact with storm totem more

665
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
yes uh for example the second totem or ability to shadow the storm totem for a massive lightning

666
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
explosion those are both great ideas uh is there any chance we might see a rework or polish to the

667
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:00,000
skill upgrade lagonian diplomacy so that it targets things better uh it's a gathering storm node

668
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:07,000
thank you for that tip uh i know where gathering storm is on the tree it's right there

669
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
uh we're wielding a staff the melee attack gathering storm is replaced by a direct range oh yes this one

670
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:36,000
is on um there was we changes there's something we changed recently on this

671
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
there was some there was animation changes we did for this i think and there was something else

672
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:48,000
we changed recently too i'm gonna go with yes is the answer uh hello mike can't wait for season two

673
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,000
keep up the good job thank you uh you do with last epoch will with changes to set items and set

674
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
charge crafting how will cof bonus dropping the whole set instead of one be balanced

675
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
i it already is balanced uh so it won't change it's it's you just drop the whole set

676
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
uh yeah uh do you guys the that uh that bonus for dropping the set items was kind of put in

677
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,000
knowing that we were going to do something like this um and people like it's useless and terrible

678
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and we're like yeah it is now but it will be good and now it's being good uh do you guys plan

679
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
on doing public ptrs in the future like how diablo 4 does it maybe we've got a ct program a community

680
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:31,000
tester program that we really really like um we probably want to open it up a little bit more

681
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
we're still working on how we're going to do that it's it's it's tricky um yeah

682
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:43,000
no specific details but we are planning on revamping that system for us

683
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,000
ah hi what's your stance on snapshotting minions with gear fixable um it is

684
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
it's a really frustrating problem

685
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
uh we've we've experimented with some different ways of fixing it um

686
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:09,000
um falcon fixes it decently well but it has a lot of advantages that we can't use for regular minions

687
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,000
um so we're we're working on it all right got an idea for we're at the 130 mark or the 330 mark

688
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
so it's uh we're 45 minutes behind still in chat so i apologize if i haven't gotten your question yet

689
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
i've got an idea for a question while you've talked about elemental damage does it make sense

690
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
to make similar thing for necrotic poison void damage something that can be corrupted damage

691
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
i've literally pitched that exact thing before we're not doing it yet uh any plans on letting

692
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
us change what means look like yes uh there will be minion cosmetics eventually i don't think there

693
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
is any for season two drop though all right and and there are some times uh there's there's

694
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:52,000
items that change as well like um uh something's a little out of the effects to it or um there's

695
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
some of their skills uh like like the saber tooth when you take the cold nodes and the saber

696
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:04,000
two that changes the cold saber tooth uh last if i can we get a sell all button ah we need to have

697
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
a lock button first for locking items in your inventory we don't have that at the moment so

698
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,000
maybe in the future not season two uh what are the cocooned uniques they are cool uniques they're new

699
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
uh the ones shown in the season two trailer uh stay tuned to the itemization podcast that we will

700
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
reveal that in uh any plans to allow the complete reset of all monolith progression

701
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:31,000
um you can do this pretty quickly oh like complete reset of all progression uh no

702
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
if you really want to do this like it's kind of like make a solo character um

703
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
or or or start the new season when it starts type thing

704
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:52,000
uh any chance we could get xp per hour when you hover over the xp bar like peewee 2 has

705
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,000
hold on a break like me yeah um i don't think that's unreasonable uh we don't have time for season

706
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,000
two to put it in right now but uh i i like that idea i think it's cool uh hey mike any thoughts on

707
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
implementing an achievement system either for in-game or through steam oh yes we've been brainstorming

708
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:16,000
achievement ideas and cool things to get people on for uh what's up mike hello can we get a bit more

709
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
parity between movement skills right now you get some over terrain through walls others do not for

710
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
instance you leap are currently the leap you are currently using won't leap up ridges but the acolyte

711
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:35,000
transplant will yeah um and other ones will go right through walls all together sometimes we we are

712
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:47,000
the way part of it is the problem that the way that the they they each try to figure out if it's

713
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,000
a legal place to leap to or teleport to um i think it does make a lot of sense that thematically

714
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
they have slightly different functionality um mechanically it is very frustrating i can i see

715
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
where you're coming from so it's it's a good discussion topic but there's nothing changing to it right away

716
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
all right if it can be commented will the new update for controller allow aiming with the right

717
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
stick and movement with the left stick in any capacity uh no it doesn't do that

718
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
i don't know if this question has been asked before

719
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
uh sorry if it did it's okay will there be some new things during the campaign you know just to spice up

720
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,000
a bit yeah um for example the champions uh appear in the campaign

721
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:41,000
all right any possibility for mtx for transformations uh you buy wherebear mtx instantly yeah uh we are

722
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
working on mtx transformations there are none available in season two uh they're they're one of the things

723
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:57,000
where it's like each each transformation ntx is the amount of work of like 10 15 other ones so it's um

724
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
especially early on we're like how many can we get into the game and we can we can put some in

725
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
that you can that can be affected by you when you're still in transformed mode because you're

726
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
triggering other abilities so you can still take advantage of it when you're transformed um

727
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:23,000
yeah it's it's it's not in the first wave but yes we we do we have mtx we have cosmetic

728
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
um visual changes and audio changes to uh every every ability type planned

729
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:36,000
uh most of the armor mtx looks like it was designed on an acolyte or a sork a lot of them

730
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
the model weirdly on a primalist are you guys going to design armor mtx using a primalist the base or

731
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:51,000
thought of it um the they all get uh all all of the cosmetics are individually made for each one

732
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
like so they are that there's like a it's a it's an actual different model that's on the primalist it's

733
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:03,000
not a stretched model um but i don't know how the uh the base design process happens for that i would

734
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,000
assume it's on a on a generic uh none of them piece like it's not any one of them individually

735
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
but maybe it's closer to one of the other ones i don't know

736
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,000
hello good to see you good to see you too quick question why there is no option to set skills to the

737
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:29,000
left middle mouse button when changing the hotkeys uh the left mouse button is pretty it it's reserved

738
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,000
for a lot of functions that uh it probably still live uh it's reserved for a lot of functions that

739
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:45,000
we don't want to override um you can set an ability to your left mouse click here so uh let me do this and

740
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
i mean i'm i'm left clicking when i do that

741
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
so it is like it is it is possible to to set an ability there

742
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,000
uh middle mouse i'm not sure why it's not an option and i realize that uh you can't see me when

743
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
i did that example but i promise you it worked i did get frenzy

744
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:19,000
yeah um in the future would we ever be able to get a system to combine unwanted idols to re-roll to

745
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
a new idol like a recombination for idols um i i think that's possible um it's not something we're

746
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
adding right now but i do like the idea and it's i've have heard it pitched before

747
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
uh with the updates to electrify and time rock coming are there any plans to take a look at the

748
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
other damaging ailments to make them more varied uh currently bleeding knight and frostbite and poison are so

749
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
mechanically similar that the optimal way to use all of them is just the same just apply as many stacks as possible

750
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
and it's pretty boring um

751
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:56,000
i i yes do you have any good examples i'd really love to hear the specific examples on this

752
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:07,000
um the time rot overhaul is in season two um and i think that's a really good example of finding a way to

753
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:14,000
a way to do one of them um but yeah the if you got any ideas for the other ones i'm all ears

754
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
all right uh one thing i realized today i don't know if it has been mentioned yet stash is usually

755
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:27,000
organized by item type because we got filters for that but for every item type a row gets left empty

756
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
at the bottom yes uh if i fill the stash tab with boots for example there will be a single row left

757
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
which is not enough for boots is possible to add one more row uh it's a huge pain to add one more

758
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,000
roll row and we absolutely should have originally i don't know if we can fix this or not but it's

759
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
yes uh please yes please please please please

760
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,000
all right how many total points in the weaver tree will we get and how many the total points are in the

761
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:04,000
tree we haven't said this yet um i don't know off the top of my head you'll you'll have fewer you'll

762
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
have less than half the number of points you will be able to invest less than half the number of points

763
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,000
i can say that so you're gonna have to make some some hard choices on what you actually want to go for

764
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
um and there's a there's a fair few options

765
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
uh right it's it's a it's a big enough tree that you have to the window scrolls like the

766
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
window scrolls around it's not you can't see all of them on one window

767
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
all right hey mike what's up with the judgment gloves equip level being 20 levels before you unlock

768
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:41,000
the skill uh it's just there's other stats in there that are uh that are good to use and

769
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:48,000
i i don't think there was any big big thing about it it is kind of funny though uh anything that will

770
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,000
make it easier to distinguish my pets from enemies i mean the the health bars if you really want to

771
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
distinguish your pets from enemies the health bars are the best way to do it i think um

772
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
there we go minions get green health bars your enemies get red health bars

773
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,000
uh how are spires changing can you say more they're going to be uh i don't know how to say

774
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
exactly what it is they're going to be much more um

775
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,000
localized and uh interesting encounters

776
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:22,000
yeah

777
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,000
uh what is the average spawn rate for nemesis i'm curious to know around what my chances are i've

778
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
encountered them since if i go 3-3 into faded nemesis weaver node

779
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
um i don't know what the base spawn rate is i know that when you're at like um

780
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
like extreme corruption numbers it's it is almost every echo

781
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,000
uh any chance that other classes will be added to act as exiled mage alternatives like exiled powder

782
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
or exiled lich uh the way that they're there um like the the reason that they're there doesn't make

783
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,000
any sense for other classes so probably not um i would love to i mean this is uh i see where the

784
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
the this is something that has been suggested a few times and i understand based on what happened

785
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:18,000
yesterday why this question is getting asked today um and i think that there's a good opportunity for

786
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,000
things like it in the future but uh the whole reason exiled mages exist and the theming the story

787
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
behind that is it wouldn't really make sense for other classes uh is there any plans for improving

788
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
minion control particularly for melee minions it's possible to keep them from running into big boss

789
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:38,000
attacks um not specifically but they're really really durable to area of effect attacks

790
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,000
uh will all items uh have parity between two and three d models uh i mean that's the goal we make

791
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:55,000
2d items way faster than we make 3d items um so it's the idea of slowing down the 3d item production

792
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,000
or the 2d item production in order to let 3d item um catch up uh feels very counterintuitive to me for

793
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:08,000
uh just having a fun game so probably not anytime soon but that is the goal uh hi any plans on

794
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
implementing dlss or the and the latest fsr uh i i don't know specifically if that's going to happen

795
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:21,000
or not i know it's on the list uh i don't think it's coming in season two are champion bosses going to be

796
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:28,000
real bosses with mechanics or they essentially beefed up rare mods um they do have specific

797
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:34,000
mechanics they they are like it's not just like any minion can be championed they are specific

798
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:42,000
boss encounters more mini boss encounters um but they do have like bespoke mechanics and abilities

799
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
and things that they do that are thematically appropriate and uh are reflected in the affixes

800
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:53,000
they drop and things like that hey mike it's me again welcome back uh any chance we can add the

801
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:01,000
extra passives and idle slots to dungeon completion i i i would prefer to add them to the uh monolith

802
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,000
completion quests personally um but yeah that's a chance uh any chance for heart seeker to become both

803
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:18,000
throwing and ranged per default uh i assume this is asking about throwing and bow like have both tags

804
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
simultaneously no definitely not uh would you guys consider revisiting some current season mechanics

805
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
say two years from now maybe the team wanted to do more things with the weaver expansion but couldn't

806
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,000
squeeze it in absolutely um i i think you won't have to wait that long uh what is the issue team

807
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,000
approach to balancing player agency against build power levels as a discussion point the team often

808
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,000
says they don't want to have non-interactive builds which are also s tier to me proactively adjusting or

809
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
limiting this for example reflect damage seems like a huge trade-off for the ability to player to

810
01:27:49,000 --> 01:28:01,000
choose certain kinds of skills can you hear your thoughts um i think that yeah so in general we're

811
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:07,000
much more in favor of of kind of just like letting letting putting putting stuff out there into the

812
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
world and and seeing what happens let's let's see what what wacky and cool stuff you guys can come up

813
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:21,000
with that's sort of the um the best case scenario uh sometimes there are uh in very rare cases builds

814
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:28,000
that pop up that are really really boring to play like like and we're talking extreme cases that we that

815
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:37,000
we try and limit these in so like let's say there was a build that um you could you could you take

816
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,000
this build it was it was pretty easy to make uh and you could take this build into into uber abroth

817
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
and you could beat uber abroth no matter what like guaranteed win success no problem you can literally

818
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,000
walk away from your computer but it takes 12 hours and we're talking hyperbole example here this is a

819
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:00,000
stupid example it's not real but like that's bad that's that is you like having 12 hours to kill

820
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
something like if it's the objectively easiest way to do it where you're like okay i got these items

821
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
together put my character i stepped into the ring and i left and i came back tomorrow and i beat the

822
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
boss great it it kind of devalues the achievement the accomplishment um

823
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:23,000
um and it's just it's boring sitting there for that long so it's like um i i think that it's a

824
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
in the extreme cases is is when we really try and steer away from it

825
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
uh also i missed these ago but burt popcorn and

826
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
undread one thank you for the subs i appreciate you both and they all go to charity

827
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
all right oh something in my eye

828
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
spilling ginger ale on my play mat oh my goodness

829
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
all right any thoughts on lowering the skill level requirements the last three skills by five levels

830
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
uh 20 to 15 35 to 30 50 to 45 probably not um

831
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:18,000
um they're the like passive requirements not levels but generally you get that from levels and

832
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
and

833
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
idris thank you very much the sub appreciate you too

834
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,000
um i would say it's very unlikely um it is something that we do look at and adjust so there

835
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:37,000
could be some tweaks and things like that um you are talking about specialization points aren't you not

836
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:44,000
the actual skill unlocks i think looking at what those numbers are um still probably pretty unlikely

837
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:52,000
but it's possible i don't know if this exists in the game but has there been any thoughts to doing

838
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
group up maps or modifiers scale based on the number of people in the party well the modifiers do scale

839
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:02,000
based on the number of people in the party um like it just when you group up stuff gets harder in general

840
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:09,000
like and it's just it's a flat scaler so everything affects it um and we've we have talked about

841
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
uh you know other other multiplayer specific mechanics and things like that that's something

842
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
that we've we've discussed and it's possible it's not something we're looking at right away yet but you

843
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:26,000
know uh i'd i would love to do mechanically specific multiplayer things where it's like

844
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
like the the fight's not really uh like required to do as a group but like i don't know some some

845
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,000
cool thing happens the example i always go back to is diablo 2 diablo you're fighting him he like there's

846
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
a big like bone prison cage that like comes up and like grabs a player and like another player can like

847
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
uh beat the cage and it uh breaks it open and then you can keep playing again and it's this like

848
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,000
there's this teamwork moment and like it almost never happens and all that sort of stuff but uh i do

849
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:01,000
really like the idea behind things like that all right any word on a ps5 release we'd love to do

850
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:08,000
consoles we don't have any specific info on which consoles uh when consoles anything like that yet but

851
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
it is something that we are looking into and we would love to see move forward we just don't have

852
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:23,000
any details at all i'm sorry all right we are still 45 minutes behind but we only have

853
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
five pages of questions in the backlog hey oh getting better

854
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
i'm just i just got i just gotta burn through these these are it's it's great i'm sorry i'm

855
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
not really doing anything more exciting on screen to do a dance at the same time

856
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
uh are there plans to make bosses mechanically more interesting and difficult at higher

857
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
difficulties like empowered monoliths rather than just percentage boost two stats i think boss

858
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:53,000
fights evolving with difficulty isn't amazing um and is amazing and much more interesting absolutely yeah

859
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
i agree heavy yes i agree um i'd love to

860
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
i'm working on it don't worry uh hey mike i had an idea on whether we could

861
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
uh be able to change the base item and slash of unique slash legend they're using this using an

862
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
in-game mechanic like a temporal sanctum wondering if this is something that could work be too powerful

863
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:22,000
or even be possible um the way that our uh unique the way their item system works changing the base

864
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
type of an item would require us to create that item as a base type for that unique um and have it

865
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
kind of sitting in the background not doing anything we have had uniques that have had multiple base

866
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
types and since have removed i think removed all the multiple base type variations for unique so that

867
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,000
they're all just one now um it's possible i could see it coming back uh i think it would be like

868
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,000
specific options having it be any option would require a pretty massive change the way the item is

869
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:57,000
built um it's not impossible pretty unlikely though uh can class specific set bonuses be used by other classes no

870
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:05,000
um mostly because you won't be able to equip the item in the first place because there will be a class

871
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:13,000
requirement on the item uh like you could uh if you could get the items all equipped uh the class

872
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:20,000
bonuses and you could get that that that ability to proc somehow like if you um uh i guess so

873
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
hypothetically here's here's one uh yeah actually yes it would work so here's an example of one that

874
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:31,000
would work uh if you have the harbinger of stars belt and hypothetically if the lodger staff does have

875
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,000
the um i mean you can do this now actually can't you is the staff class locked even now

876
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
i don't have one um if the staff's not class locked you can do it now um

877
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:03,000
but yeah like the sitting under everything uh sitting on this um on this character right now

878
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:12,000
is the mutator for meteor uh and if you get the stat if this character somehow got an item equipped

879
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,000
onto it that had the stat uh lightning conversion for meteor it would work and then if if this character

880
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
somehow had ability to trigger meteor like the belt it would trigger and work for it so it is

881
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,000
hypothetically possible um i don't know if that staff is class locked and i'm not confirming or not

882
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
if the if that mod is moving over or not

883
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
and i realized that i'm

884
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
zooming in and stuff on a character that you guys can't see

885
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,000
see

886
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:55,000
here we go you can see me hi i think i have one more i think i have one more teaser

887
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:09,000
we're just gonna shove that one up i think this is new hope it's new

888
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:17,000
all right uh will we get class reworks for season three again or is the you pleased with the current

889
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
classes specialization um i think the

890
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
i think the changes required for

891
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,000
there are certain there are certain classes that i think are in more need of love than other classes

892
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,000
right now in the game even i i want season two launches a little bit there'll be some that are

893
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:45,000
more better than others um and so we will be looking at specific ones to get more changes more

894
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:52,000
mechanical changes than others um but i think it'll be less a lower scope than the sentinel one that was

895
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
just done and we'll be looking to add more new things in the future instead

896
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:06,000
any plans to give players a possibility to cover less rare shards to convert less rare shards into

897
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
more rare shards at a ratio or something yes we are planning this um we have way too many regular

898
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
shards on our hands and in game yeah we are we're working on a shard conversion system where you can

899
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:22,000
trade in shards uh in mana strike with 100 spark charge nodes with the left side mana arc skill node

900
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:30,000
does mana arc also have 100 spark charge chance mana arc affected by mana strike nodes uh question mark

901
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:37,000
i'd have to double check uh i i'd have to double check exactly how it's worded

902
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:55,000
can we check quickly can we check quickly mana art

903
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:04,000
mana arc creative and mana storm cost less increase kit

904
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:14,000
mana storm mana strike additionally strikes enemies it hits with mana arc yeah this should

905
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,000
yeah

906
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
this should inherit everything

907
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:27,000
because it's it specifically says mana strike additionally strikes enemies so it's mana strike

908
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
that's doing the striking which means that it is inheriting things that mana strike already has

909
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
unless it's worded wrong it works

910
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:45,000
uh what's the ultimate goal with the sentinel rework to make more fun and viable options with higher variety

911
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
in available abilities

912
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:58,000
uh will we be able to search ex accepted prophecies i don't think so uh will you get different set

913
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:04,000
shards for each piece of the set or will the weapon set item always give you this uh give you the weapon

914
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,000
such the weapon such the weapon from the set item will always give you the weapon set chart yeah like so

915
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,000
if you break down uh if you have a set that has like a few pieces

916
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:17,000
like

917
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
okay so if you put the like the gloves if you break down the gloves

918
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
for xeric's gloves you'll never get xeric's belt

919
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
set chart you'll always get xeric's gloves set chart

920
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:44,000
uh any plans to improve and my goodness i'm wow i actually got that mostly

921
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
mostly on screen not quite there we go

922
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
oh

923
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
any plans to improve npc models yeah there's lots of npc models that got changes yeah

924
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
uh a bit confusing question about merchant scale but since there isn't really a good way to remove

925
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:10,000
gold from the game as the season goes on it just gets traded between players causing prices to rise

926
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
up any plans to address that in the next patches i would encourage people to go to the

927
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
lightless arbor there's you can have tons of uh sweet items dropped from there yeah

928
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,000
uh any chance we get avalanche and earthquake totems and variations for them

929
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
uh so we get full totem on so we so we can go full totem on these nodes i think yeah i think that's

930
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,000
something that we are looking into for future releases but yes

931
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
i i wouldn't i i don't want to say okay i shouldn't say yes explicitly but i think there's

932
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
uh a very good argument for those things

933
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,000
all right any major balance changes for warlock or mostly balance changes around war generation

934
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:01,000
mostly around war generation there's some nodes that were overperforming that are getting a little

935
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:09,000
bit of a nerve um the sweet new unique item though uh any thoughts on any chance thoughts on changing

936
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,000
corruption scaling to increase exponentially rather than linearly i think we're doing uh

937
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:21,000
uh it's still gonna be linear but the multiplier is changing

938
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,000
i think

939
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
i think that's what we're doing so it's not one to one anymore but it is still linear it's just not

940
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:49,000
like changing this to like this you know still linear but it's well if i could draw straight it'd be

941
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:56,000
linear um but you know changing changing the the slope of it i don't know why i raised those first

942
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:05,000
all right any plans to unlock the game for steam family share no it causes a lot of problems of things

943
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:14,000
we don't have control over that we just can't do um it it there's there's things that the steam family

944
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
share does that like steam would have to change how family share works for us to re-enable it i think

945
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:28,000
um yeah which i i do not expect them to change it at all at all all right was the jump in difficulty

946
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
between monolith bosses and harbingers adjusted um

947
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,000
in a roundabout way yes

948
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:51,000
i mean technically no but in effect yes i like your your the average character power level will

949
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,000
be higher at that point in the game so you'll um you'll have an easier time making that transition

950
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
um but it's still it's still a decent jump

951
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:05,000
i know we have a bunch of b uniques we are running low on time here catch i think we're

952
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,000
going to stop taking questions fairly soon um i'm trying to get through as many we've devolved

953
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:15,000
into just a straight question answer stream instead of me playing which is fine uh and i

954
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
hope i hope you guys are liking it still but um i do have a lot of questions to get through here still

955
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:25,000
uh i know we have a bunch of b uniques how about some growl uniques yeah like turn bear into some

956
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:33,000
girl love it love it yes please sign me up um nothing coming in season two sorry uh if there was one

957
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
feature change you're most proud of that the team achieved for this update what would it be

958
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
uh procedural generation definitely

959
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,000
uh i can say that because i had nothing to do with it

960
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:53,000
uh if there was one feature change uh will we get more freedom on some weapons like bows

961
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:59,000
or new weapons like crossbows yeah um season two doesn't have a ton of this um but we are definitely

962
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
looking forward to new weapon types new weapon base types um i think a lot of those will come

963
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:08,000
with new classes uh or new abilities that go with them specifically things like that but yes we are

964
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:18,000
actively looking at new uh new weapon types in the future uh will primal ancient hunt be more be

965
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:25,000
a model of activity or separate system like arena dungeons um it is not implemented uh i don't have

966
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
any specific details on it and even though i did i probably couldn't share them um

967
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:37,000
so i'm sorry i'm gonna have to skip this one uh are you guys working on sounds for drops in the

968
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:45,000
loot filter kind of like how peewee does it uh i'm i'm working on it uh in the sense of uh pitching it

969
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:54,000
still over and over and over so keep suggesting it in our suggestions forums and discord channels

970
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:01,000
and places that you can suggest it uh do you see any set items being relevant to use the item itself

971
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
at base slot or all the set items now just basically pinata for affixes no i do think that there's going to

972
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,000
be situations uh where you'll want to use the base set item more than before specifically because

973
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,000
you'll be able to access the set um the set bonus for that set item a lot cheaper so the opportunity

974
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:22,000
cost right now of accessing a set bonus so if there's a set bonus you want um the opportunity

975
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:31,000
cost of accessing that set bonus is three pieces right um and if there's a or two pieces in some cases

976
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:37,000
if there's a uh so this is a set item there's a specific affix on a set item that you want it's

977
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:44,000
like a really powerful set affix um sometimes you will uh like what you're what you're getting out of

978
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:51,000
that set item sometimes isn't enough to make it worthwhile putting in your build but you can look

979
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:56,000
at it a little bit differently now in the sense that the opera the the the amount of space that that set

980
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:03,000
item is taking up in your build is now maybe one set item and two affixes on other items and then

981
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
you're getting then you can look at like the set item and the set bonus that it brings all as one

982
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:13,000
thing and the opportunity cost is so much lower that you're much more likely to uh to want to pick

983
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:18,000
up that set item and i do i understand the quite i kind of i misspoke a little bit here when i said um

984
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
actually didn't misspeak but i kind of implied that i was talking about the set bonus instead of the

985
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,000
actual affix on the item itself because there's going to be some set item affixes that don't get

986
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:34,000
pulled over with the set shards themselves um which will still be very desirable to have on the item

987
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
and the reason that they're balanced is they're balanced around having other crappy affixes on the

988
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,000
item um so there's though some of those affixes needed to stay on the set items in order to still

989
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:49,000
be balanced and not break when they come over as a set shard so we will still see in some select

990
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
situations there's a ring i'm thinking of specifically in this example that will stay

991
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
that will that will be viable as a set item because you can take the other items in that set

992
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
and put them and shadow them into affixes and slap them onto items and there's like you're using two

993
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:11,000
affix slots and it's a low uh a low requirement there and you get the set bonuses um and so yeah it's i

994
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:17,000
think there's gonna be there is room for this um and i'd love to i think this is gonna make um

995
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:23,000
um new set item creation more fun uh like for designing them

996
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,000
oh you mentioned cemeteries can or will be large how much larger you see the average echo

997
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,000
good question how much larger three times average echo is pretty small two times

998
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:46,000
i don't know somewhere in that range i am 50 minutes behind now oh my goodness mike

999
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:53,000
but it's only four pages that's good uh for weaver's tree passive in multiplayer will all effects stack in

1000
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:02,000
gameplay uh yes it has nothing to do with multiplayer though

1001
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:14,000
like if um whoever's whoever's monolith you're in is the one that the tree will take into account for

1002
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:25,000
spawning things um yeah so if if if like uh if you and i are in a party together and we're doing your

1003
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:31,000
monolith and i have a node that's like more champions will spawn um that no won't do anything

1004
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:39,000
because it's your monolith that we're in all right we are cutting off new questions right here

1005
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:46,000
no no more new questions i'm sorry um maybe maybe one or two if you sneak them in real fast but yeah

1006
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
we're we're done with new questions because i gotta get out of here at some point

1007
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:03,000
all right uh for weaver tree passive audiences uh one of the biggest challenges in merchant

1008
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
skill has been trading high lp items that are extremely valuable due to the gold cap

1009
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
uh any changes coming out would you share your insight on it um i i think

1010
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
i don't have a good answer to this one i'm sorry i'd love to

1011
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,000
do

1012
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
there's stuff we're working on that's not going to make it into season two to help with this

1013
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
uh are you going to up the character limit from 25 or is 25 your highest you're going to go yeah

1014
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,000
we're gonna increase it still um i'm shocked it's still as low as 25 i could have sworn it went higher

1015
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:44,000
than that um do you know what righteous fire build is yes uh and if so will paladins be able to make

1016
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:53,000
something similar with the rework uh not easily not not as effective as the one you're used to

1017
01:49:53,000 --> 01:50:03,000
in other games uh how do you know uh how far out will which season how far out which season do you

1018
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
plan to split off season cycle from legacy resets that are still the same content

1019
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:18,000
oh like like um like where you stop applying some content from the new season to legacy on c on

1020
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:24,000
patch day drop i have no idea um i hope it's not too far out though because i actually like doing that

1021
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
uh will stash tabs carry over into next season or will you need to buy them again you'll need to

1022
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
buy them again just like normal uh locked one lp unique item prophecy cost is higher than other

1023
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:40,000
prophecies uh but with nemesis some can say without lp item is better because you can place it in the

1024
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
nemesis egg to upgrade it is there any changes coming to prophecies in season two much love can't

1025
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:52,000
wait for season two patch um there are changes to prophecies coming in season two there is not this

1026
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,000
change you're requesting coming to season two prophecies there is a different system to address this

1027
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,000
issue in season two coming so we are fixing this not the way you're asking to it's gonna be great

1028
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:07,000
uh i hope we can talk about this in the next podcast though yeah uh do you guys have any bias

1029
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:14,000
for or against big slams and single big hits nope um i i think i probably have a slight bias towards

1030
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:19,000
them because i think they're fun uh i like setting up or building around big single instances of damage

1031
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:27,000
but the game seems a little more geared towards spamming uh i don't i don't think there's an intentional

1032
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:34,000
bias there but there might be some unintentional stuff going on maybe um talking about rampant

1033
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:41,000
wishlisting slash future dreaming could you ever envision an mmo set in the last epoch ip uh epoch

1034
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
holders having to work together in dungeons and raids across time sounds pretty dope on paper um yeah i

1035
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:52,000
yes i've definitely imagined this in the past um

1036
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:05,000
it sounds it sounds very daunting uh but kind of in a good way i don't know love to uh is there any

1037
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:11,000
interaction combination you feel is op but underused mm nah you guys are really good at finding stuff

1038
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
uh is there any desire to change how channeling skills work to not be snapshot style for example

1039
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:21,000
healing hands only proccing once you activate the warpath but never again until you stop to

1040
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:27,000
reactivate warpath uh oh that type of snapshotting no i i think that's i'm pretty happy with how that works

1041
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
reading party

1042
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
so this is my aoe2 showing again like those the the hockey's

1043
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,000
at the start i don't know if that was from something else though anyways um

1044
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:49,000
i'm really enjoying playing purifier in grim dawn so season two launches will we ever see pistols in

1045
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:55,000
last epoch i think it's possible i think it is it's not something we have currently planned but i mean

1046
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:02,000
it's a time travel game can you kind of you can kind of do what you want right right um

1047
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:09,000
i i i there's no there's no like hard lock of like never pistols never gunpowder anything like that

1048
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:15,000
like we it's not something we are planning on right now it's not something that's in the storyline for

1049
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:19,000
the main campaign that we're that we're we have three more chapters to go in the campaign that's not

1050
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:29,000
planning to have um uh gunpowder involved in the campaign but you know there's time yeah all right

1051
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:34,000
are there any changes to exiled mages yes there's changes to exiled mages they'll they'll drop

1052
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:39,000
different stuff and tweaking some of the numbers and the way they play and stuff but yes there are

1053
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:47,000
some little changes there uh prophecies can get a bit clunky at times um having proc three at once

1054
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:51,000
massive loot piles and a hectic map you often do backtracking or risk your life while looking at loot

1055
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
is this an issue to you yes it is definitely an issue do not have a great solution for it at the

1056
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:02,000
moment it's definitely an issue um we are if you do die while you're in a big loot bomb like that

1057
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,000
the items uh something we teased last week uh the items that are in the in your immediate vicinity

1058
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
when you die do get transported to echo of a world where i'm standing right now um when you die so you

1059
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:20,000
will those items will at least come with you so in the worst case scenario there's still uh um

1060
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:28,000
good a good improvement a little bit uh hello very excited for upcoming expansion me too uh question

1061
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:35,000
will there be any changes or updates to minion ai skills that uh can alter their behaviors um

1062
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:43,000
nothing like major any changes yeah there's there's little changes here and there but uh

1063
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
not not systematic wide changes

1064
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:57,000
uh hello are you trying to balance the different character classes yes or it's okay if some are more

1065
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
powerful and faster yeah i mean like we we'd like um

1066
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,000
if someone wants to go do the hardest content in the game if they're if they're opening the game and

1067
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,000
they're like i wonder what class i'm going to play i want to be able to complete the hardest content in the

1068
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:19,000
game um i'd like that first decision on which class i'm going to play to be which class do i connect with

1069
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,000
the most which class resonates with me the style the theming what's what's the most exciting thing

1070
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:29,000
for me to take on as a character to embody in a fantasy to enjoy rather than which one's going to be

1071
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:35,000
the most powerful because the even if you're even if that's your main goal they're all going to have at least some

1072
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:44,000
path to victory for you uh when will be new class it's been too long it's a little bit still new

1073
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:53,000
new classes are humongous um because there's because you can't we don't take that we don't

1074
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:59,000
nothing's cross class for us so like um like summon wolf isn't an ability for if we if we add a new

1075
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
class that someone wolf doesn't there's nothing that someone does that makes that easier to make

1076
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:10,000
well that's some little things behind the scenes but not much especially not from the art team um

1077
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
oh we're getting low technically three minutes until this is over there are

1078
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:23,000
two pages of of of questions left i'm gonna finish these questions out

1079
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
we're not taking more questions i'm sorry i'm gonna here let's slap up all the rest of the stuff

1080
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
whatonge who gets 合 tinha

1081
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
well

1082
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
uh

1083
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:44,000
good

1084
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:45,000
good

1085
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:46,000
good

1086
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
good

1087
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
good

1088
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:54,000
good

1089
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:01,000
There we go.

1090
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
You can see me.

1091
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Hi!

1092
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Alright.

1093
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Any performance improvements in the

1094
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
upcoming patch? Oh yeah.

1095
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Have you guys thought about trying

1096
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
rewards to echo

1097
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
objectives? Alter spines, ambush, and possibly

1098
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
letting players choose what objectives to go after?

1099
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Yeah.

1100
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Like, are you saying

1101
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
having multiple objectives in a

1102
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
single echo?

1103
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Lesser

1104
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
on that one.

1105
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
But yeah, a lot

1106
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
of what this

1107
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
a lot of what the Weaver's tree has to do

1108
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
is that. Yeah.

1109
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Can we see you do

1110
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
and explain a bit of crafting?

1111
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Oh, we are right near the end of the stream.

1112
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,000
I tell you what,

1113
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
crafting is...

1114
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
There's enough in-depth stuff on crafting

1115
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
that I'm going to...

1116
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I'm going to point you at...

1117
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
There's so many creators that have wonderful

1118
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
crafting videos

1119
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
that explain crafting

1120
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
that I'm going to point you at one of those.

1121
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Just type, like,

1122
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
go to YouTube and type

1123
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
last epoch crafting

1124
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:19,000
and you'll get a full rundown.

1125
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:21,000
There's...

1126
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
I know there's a whole bunch

1127
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
of really good ones out there.

1128
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Alright.

1129
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Why are information on blessings

1130
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
locked behind having them

1131
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:31,000
show up

1132
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
when you pick one?

1133
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Having to look up

1134
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
where the ones you want

1135
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
outside the game

1136
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,000
is a minor annoyance

1137
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
if you can't memorize them all.

1138
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Yeah.

1139
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
This comes back

1140
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
to a little bit of the whole, like...

1141
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Back when I was a kid.

1142
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
And...

1143
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
That sense of, like,

1144
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
discovery, I think.

1145
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
A little bit.

1146
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
We love to have

1147
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
in situations like this.

1148
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
And you're right.

1149
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Because, you know,

1150
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
it's a thing.

1151
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
It makes it kind of pointless.

1152
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Um...

1153
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
I don't have a great answer

1154
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:09,000
for you.

1155
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
But I think it's a bit

1156
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
of a holdover

1157
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
from a wanting

1158
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:13,000
to have a sense

1159
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
of discovery

1160
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:14,000
on something like this

1161
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
and a bit of nostalgia

1162
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
for us, probably.

1163
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Is there any plan

1164
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
to be able to turn...

1165
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I think it's...

1166
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I should also say as well,

1167
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
it's a bit of...

1168
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
If you're at the point

1169
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
where you're min-maxing

1170
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
your blessings,

1171
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
you've probably already

1172
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
unlocked a good chunk

1173
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
of them or, you know,

1174
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
like, you've done a little bit

1175
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
of that discovery process

1176
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
already as well.

1177
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Maybe they should...

1178
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Uh...

1179
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
An option...

1180
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
An option might be...

1181
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
We're not doing this,

1182
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:43,000
but I think it's something

1183
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
that we could considerably...

1184
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Something that could

1185
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
conceivably be pitched is

1186
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,000
if you have...

1187
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
When you unlock Empowered,

1188
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
having all the blessings

1189
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
from completed timelines

1190
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
of normal

1191
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
get unlocked

1192
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
at base rate

1193
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
so you'd see

1194
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:57,000
at least what's there.

1195
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Because there's the normal

1196
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
and the Empowered blessings

1197
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
and so if you unlock...

1198
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Or if you complete

1199
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
a timeline

1200
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:03,000
on Empowered

1201
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
or something like

1202
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
having all the base ones

1203
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
unlocked or something like that.

1204
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I don't know.

1205
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Is there any plan

1206
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
to be able to turn down

1207
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
skill effect opacity?

1208
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I'd love to.

1209
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
We don't have it right now,

1210
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
but I'd say it's on the...

1211
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
On the long list of likes.

1212
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
It's very hard to see

1213
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:21,000
what's going on

1214
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
when spamming some skills,

1215
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
especially in multiplayer.

1216
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Uh...

1217
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
That was me

1218
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
adding that last bit.

1219
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
How viable is hardcore

1220
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
in LE so far?

1221
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Very, I would say.

1222
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Has anyone beaten

1223
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
the end game

1224
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:32,000
completed in hardcore?

1225
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Oh yeah.

1226
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:33,000
What's your predictions

1227
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
for hardcore completion

1228
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
time frame for season 2?

1229
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Like, Uber, Abby,

1230
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
season 2,

1231
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
hardcore

1232
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,000
completion kill

1233
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
on the season.

1234
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I'm going to say

1235
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
six days.

1236
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:52,000
I'm going to say

1237
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
someone does it

1238
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
in six days.

1239
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
No, that's way too little.

1240
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I'm going to say

1241
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:56,000
someone does it

1242
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
in nine days.

1243
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
That's better.

1244
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:00,000
That's the prediction.

1245
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Nine days for someone

1246
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,000
to kill Uber, Abby,

1247
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
and hardcore

1248
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
on the season.

1249
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Not solo.

1250
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Solo I think

1251
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
will take a lot longer.

1252
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Alright, will

1253
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Temporal Sancton T4

1254
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:12,000
boss get nerfed?

1255
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Probably not.

1256
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,000
I think she is

1257
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
really punishing

1258
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
with almost everything

1259
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
one-shotting you.

1260
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Not even Abraoth

1261
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
does that,

1262
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
or at least Abraoth

1263
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
is more mechanic-focused.

1264
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I think Abraoth

1265
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
is a lot stronger.

1266
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
In general.

1267
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
But yeah,

1268
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
there's always room

1269
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:40,000
for improvements

1270
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
on the bosses,

1271
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:41,000
and I think maybe

1272
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
it might be just like

1273
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
a, as you say,

1274
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
more mechanic-focused.

1275
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Maybe it just needs

1276
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
to be more clear

1277
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
on what's happening.

1278
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
But I think

1279
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
it's appropriate

1280
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
that completing

1281
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
very hard stuff

1282
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
gets you very good stuff.

1283
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:57,000
You know?

1284
02:01:59,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Alright, have you

1285
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
considered adding

1286
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
more forms for Druid?

1287
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Absolutely.

1288
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
It's a pretty huge

1289
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
undertaking adding

1290
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
in new forms for the Druid.

1291
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Those are some

1292
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,000
of the biggest skills.

1293
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Spriggan Form,

1294
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I'd argue,

1295
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
is the most involved

1296
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
skill in the game

1297
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
because it's like

1298
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
minion abilities

1299
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:13,000
and transform abilities

1300
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
are the hardest to do,

1301
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,000
and it is a transform

1302
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
ability with minion abilities.

1303
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Alright, would there

1304
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:20,000
be any way of making

1305
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
arena a loot explosion

1306
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
at the end of the waves

1307
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
instead of individual drops

1308
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
during, to make it

1309
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
a dopamine hit

1310
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
and make it more fun?

1311
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
It used to be like that.

1312
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Is it not like that now?

1313
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
The arena.

1314
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
How long has that changed?

1315
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Kane's saying he thinks

1316
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:42,000
it's still that way.

1317
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
So I, I,

1318
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
I think it might be that way?

1319
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Question mark?

1320
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Double check that.

1321
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:51,000
You can come to

1322
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
the Discord channel

1323
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:52,000
and ask the devs

1324
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
and ask me again

1325
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:53,000
if it's not like that,

1326
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
but I think it's like that.

1327
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Alright, will there be

1328
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
more monster lore?

1329
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Oh yeah.

1330
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
As a big D3 fanboy,

1331
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I kind of miss

1332
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
the lore around monster types.

1333
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
For example,

1334
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
the tongue eater,

1335
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
which lashes out

1336
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:04,000
their tongue

1337
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,000
into others' mouths

1338
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:06,000
and eating them in D3.

1339
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,000
That's gross.

1340
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Yeah, adding a best area

1341
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:10,000
is something that we've

1342
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
long wanted to do,

1343
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
and I really hope

1344
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
we're able to.

1345
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I think there's,

1346
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
the game guide is,

1347
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
when it was first made,

1348
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
it was made in the,

1349
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:19,000
in the assumption

1350
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
that the best area

1351
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
would go with there as well.

1352
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Or bestiary,

1353
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
whatever you say it.

1354
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:23,000
I don't know.

1355
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I always get it wrong.

1356
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Mike,

1357
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
last time you have mentioned

1358
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
to me about the primordial

1359
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
content,

1360
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
may I know,

1361
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
is it moved to much later season

1362
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:33,000
or is it scrapped?

1363
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I have no details

1364
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
on what's happening with it.

1365
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
The only information

1366
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:38,000
on future content

1367
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
that we have available

1368
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
is in the,

1369
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,000
uh,

1370
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
sign,

1371
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:42,000
in the,

1372
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
um,

1373
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
roadmap document.

1374
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Um,

1375
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
nothing really gets

1376
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
scrapped forever.

1377
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Uh,

1378
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
are there,

1379
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:50,000
are there plans

1380
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
to add more group

1381
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
play tools?

1382
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Things like buffs

1383
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
for Farty members

1384
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
and PoE or bots,

1385
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
not incentives

1386
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
like Magic Find.

1387
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Um,

1388
02:03:59,000 --> 02:03:59,000
yeah,

1389
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I think there's,

1390
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
we do frequently

1391
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
put in things

1392
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
that are functional,

1393
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
that are useful

1394
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
in multiplayer.

1395
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Um,

1396
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
it is tricky

1397
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
because a lot of people

1398
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:10,000
play solo again

1399
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
and so like having,

1400
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
um,

1401
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:17,000
having too much power

1402
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
going to multiplayer stuff

1403
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:18,000
can,

1404
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
can restrict some

1405
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
of the content

1406
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:20,000
at the end.

1407
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
But I think it's the,

1408
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
the usual thing

1409
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
is the,

1410
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
that a well-oiled

1411
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
machine of multiplayer

1412
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,000
should be slightly

1413
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
more powerful

1414
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
than a,

1415
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
um,

1416
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
a well-thought-out

1417
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
individual build

1418
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:33,000
which should be

1419
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
slightly more powerful

1420
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
or significantly more powerful

1421
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:36,000
than a,

1422
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:37,000
um,

1423
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
haphazardly slapped together

1424
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
multiplayer build

1425
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
of multiple characters.

1426
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,000
And,

1427
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
but yeah,

1428
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,000
there's,

1429
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,000
there's some new,

1430
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:49,000
there's some new stuff

1431
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
we're adding in there

1432
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
that'll be sweet.

1433
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Uh,

1434
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
especially in a new,

1435
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
uh,

1436
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:56,000
unique item

1437
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
that I may have mentioned

1438
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
earlier in the stream slightly.

1439
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Uh,

1440
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
currently there are five

1441
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
conversion options

1442
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
for Abyssal Echo.

1443
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Presumably it fit the theme

1444
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
with Forge Guard

1445
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
and Paladins.

1446
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Uh,

1447
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Warpath has an autocast node

1448
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
for AE,

1449
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
but it's locked behind a node

1450
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
that changes Warpath to Void.

1451
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
And it says it invalidates

1452
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:13,000
the fire conversion node

1453
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
of Warpath.

1454
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,000
It's something addressed

1455
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:15,000
in Season 2.

1456
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I feel like

1457
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
we talked about this

1458
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
in Ask the Devs?

1459
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Or someone else was asking

1460
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
the exact same question

1461
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:21,000
in Ask the Devs

1462
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
and there's a gigantic answer

1463
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
I wrote in there recently.

1464
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Um,

1465
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
it's,

1466
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I don't think this is a

1467
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
problem to be solved really.

1468
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
I think it's important

1469
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
that the,

1470
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:32,000
like,

1471
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
it needs to go behind

1472
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
one of the fire

1473
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
or void conversion nodes.

1474
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Um,

1475
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
and it fits best

1476
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
behind the void conversion node

1477
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:39,000
for sure.

1478
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Um,

1479
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I think it could go,

1480
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
a second similar node

1481
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
could go behind

1482
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
the fire conversion node.

1483
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Um,

1484
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
but the better solution

1485
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
would be to put this

1486
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
behind a mutually

1487
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,000
exclusive node,

1488
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
like a new style of node

1489
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
that we don't have existing yet.

1490
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Um,

1491
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
which would be something like,

1492
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:56,000
hey,

1493
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:56,000
this node,

1494
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
you can pick either A or B.

1495
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:58,000
So it'd be like,

1496
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:58,000
this node,

1497
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
you can take the fire

1498
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
or void conversion.

1499
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:00,000
It's a single point.

1500
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
You have to pick which one you get

1501
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
and then you can put things

1502
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
behind them both

1503
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
that are mutually exclusive.

1504
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
That's the way I'd want to

1505
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
handle something like this instead.

1506
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Um,

1507
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
but we don't have that tech

1508
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
so we're not doing it yet.

1509
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Uh,

1510
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
are you guys planning on

1511
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:11,000
upgrading servers?

1512
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Yes.

1513
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Also,

1514
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
how is trading faction,

1515
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:14,000
duping,

1516
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
exploiting issues

1517
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
are going to be handled

1518
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
this season since we pretty much

1519
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
breaks the game

1520
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,000
in the first week?

1521
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Well,

1522
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
we haven't had any,

1523
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
um,

1524
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
duping or exploiting

1525
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
things like that happen

1526
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
in the most recent,

1527
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
like the most recent ladder

1528
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
and,

1529
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
um,

1530
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
uh,

1531
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
bazaar were clean.

1532
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
There were no issues there.

1533
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Um,

1534
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:37,000
there was no

1535
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
incident.

1536
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Um,

1537
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
since the last incident

1538
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:42,000
that happened,

1539
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,000
um,

1540
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
like a couple times ago,

1541
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,000
uh,

1542
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,000
we have

1543
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
entirely new,

1544
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,000
uh,

1545
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:48,000
detection,

1546
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
and,

1547
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
uh,

1548
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
reaction systems.

1549
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Um,

1550
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
we have new safeguards in place

1551
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
to make sure it won't happen

1552
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
again as well,

1553
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
that on top of the ones

1554
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
that we did last time,

1555
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,000
um,

1556
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,000
you know,

1557
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,000
there's,

1558
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,000
we,

1559
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,000
we,

1560
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
we have new tools in place

1561
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
in,

1562
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
in like prevention,

1563
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
detection,

1564
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:04,000
and fixing.

1565
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Um,

1566
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
and,

1567
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:07,000
you know,

1568
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:07,000
it's,

1569
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
it's one of the most

1570
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,000
important things for us

1571
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:09,000
is keeping this,

1572
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
uh,

1573
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
like keeping the

1574
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
bazaar and the economy

1575
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
running smoothly

1576
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
is extremely important.

1577
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:17,000
So we're,

1578
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
we're doing everything

1579
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:18,000
we can to make sure

1580
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,000
that stays that way.

1581
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Um,

1582
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,000
and we're gonna be

1583
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
keeping a very close eye

1584
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
on everything

1585
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
right as things go live.

1586
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Um,

1587
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
as far as upgrading servers,

1588
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
yeah,

1589
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
like since,

1590
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
since 1.0 dropped,

1591
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
we have entirely new

1592
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
backend code.

1593
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Um,

1594
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
we have entirely new servers,

1595
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
like the physical machines

1596
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
are completely different.

1597
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Um,

1598
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
tons and tons of updates.

1599
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,000
So yeah,

1600
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,000
yeah,

1601
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
like we're,

1602
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
this is all stuff

1603
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
we're working very hard on,

1604
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
um,

1605
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
and is extremely important.

1606
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
It's not super flashy.

1607
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
So we don't advertise

1608
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
this stuff quite as much

1609
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
in like the,

1610
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
like the trailers

1611
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:51,000
and the videos

1612
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
and stuff like that.

1613
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,000
So you don't see like,

1614
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:53,000
like,

1615
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
um,

1616
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
new detection for,

1617
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,000
uh,

1618
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
for duping methods.

1619
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
You're like,

1620
02:07:59,000 --> 02:07:59,000
who cares?

1621
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Like,

1622
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
why is that?

1623
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
That's not something

1624
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
you show from the rooftops

1625
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:02,000
really.

1626
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:02,000
But yeah,

1627
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
it's,

1628
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,000
it's all stuff

1629
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
we are very interested

1630
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
in,

1631
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:05,000
in,

1632
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
uh,

1633
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
in keeping,

1634
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
uh,

1635
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
tight.

1636
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:09,000
And so it's,

1637
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
it's,

1638
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:10,000
it's,

1639
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:10,000
yeah,

1640
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
we're working on it hard.

1641
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
All right.

1642
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Any plans to have mass shattering?

1643
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Is it still one item at a time?

1644
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Um,

1645
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
we don't have any specific plans

1646
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
for mass shattering at the moment.

1647
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
It is still one shard at a time.

1648
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Technically we are adding it

1649
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
in a weird way.

1650
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
You're gonna be like,

1651
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:24,000
that doesn't count Mike.

1652
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:25,000
And I'm like,

1653
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:25,000
yeah,

1654
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:25,000
you're right.

1655
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
It doesn't count.

1656
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Um,

1657
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
uh,

1658
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I,

1659
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I,

1660
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I would love to see it

1661
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
to be a little bit quicker.

1662
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Um,

1663
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I'd love to say,

1664
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
I think the thing we,

1665
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I think where we're leaning towards

1666
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
right now is having a,

1667
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
like a system where you can

1668
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
mark items as trash in your

1669
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
inventory and be like,

1670
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:40,000
this is junk,

1671
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:41,000
junk,

1672
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:41,000
junk,

1673
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:41,000
junk,

1674
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:41,000
junk,

1675
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:41,000
junk.

1676
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
And then you just like shatter

1677
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
all junk,

1678
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:44,000
sell all junk.

1679
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
You know,

1680
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I have those types of buttons.

1681
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Um,

1682
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
so that's probably the most likely

1683
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:48,000
method,

1684
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
but we don't have anything planned

1685
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
for it at the moment.

1686
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Specifically.

1687
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Is it possible to move all

1688
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
respec NPCs to Echo of a World

1689
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
in season two?

1690
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:57,000
No.

1691
02:08:59,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Uh,

1692
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
is it safe to assume that

1693
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
starting season three

1694
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:07,000
season three,

1695
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
we should start to see a lot

1696
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
more set implemented since

1697
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
it's been a drought recently.

1698
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Yeah.

1699
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:10,000
I mean,

1700
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
a lot more of zero in the last

1701
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
what two,

1702
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
three releases.

1703
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Yeah.

1704
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Um,

1705
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
we're going to start,

1706
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:16,000
we're going to start

1707
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,000
assuming the set rework goes

1708
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:19,000
well,

1709
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
which I think it will go really

1710
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
well.

1711
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
I'm very confident in it.

1712
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
It's like the testing is going

1713
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
great for it.

1714
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:24,000
The reception,

1715
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:25,000
um,

1716
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
is from the public has been

1717
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
fantastic on it.

1718
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Like,

1719
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I think this is,

1720
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
um,

1721
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
this is going to be a really,

1722
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
really great system coming out.

1723
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
And,

1724
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:32,000
um,

1725
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
as long as everything with it

1726
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
goes smoothly enough that we

1727
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,000
can either fix the issues that

1728
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
do arise or just revel in the

1729
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:39,000
awesomeness of it.

1730
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Uh,

1731
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
I think we'll be looking at,

1732
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
um,

1733
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
ramping up set item development

1734
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:45,000
again.

1735
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I've got,

1736
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I've got a sticky note on my

1737
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:48,000
desktop sitting,

1738
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:48,000
right?

1739
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Not like a physical one,

1740
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
but that's,

1741
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
that's got just like set item

1742
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
ideas that I'm,

1743
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I'm waiting for the,

1744
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
for the green light to start

1745
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
posting those internally.

1746
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
All right.

1747
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Uh,

1748
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
can you do a character transfer

1749
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
like SSF to normal trade

1750
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
bonus option?

1751
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Um,

1752
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
you can,

1753
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:07,000
uh,

1754
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,000
every,

1755
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,000
every,

1756
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
yes.

1757
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
The short answer is yes here.

1758
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:11,000
I'll show you what it looks like

1759
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
really quick.

1760
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
So right at the end,

1761
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
last thing,

1762
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
settings,

1763
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:17,000
challenges.

1764
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Um,

1765
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
if you are,

1766
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
if you are on a character

1767
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
that is specifically character

1768
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
found and like a solo account

1769
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000
found,

1770
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
so all character found

1771
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
characters are also solo

1772
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
account found characters

1773
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
and also account

1774
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
factors are also regular

1775
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:31,000
ones.

1776
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,000
So it's like,

1777
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
um,

1778
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
you can abandon your

1779
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
character found challenge

1780
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
and become a solo account

1781
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:38,000
found character.

1782
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
And then you can a balance,

1783
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
abandon your solo account

1784
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
found challenge and become

1785
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:42,000
a normal character.

1786
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Um,

1787
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:43,000
so you can,

1788
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
you can take those two

1789
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
steps and you can jump.

1790
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Um,

1791
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,000
but it's a one-way transfer

1792
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,000
only if it cares,

1793
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
you cannot take a character

1794
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
and make it solo and you

1795
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
cannot take a character and

1796
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
make it character found.

1797
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
so it's one way only

1798
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
and yes the

1799
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:59,000
lots of stuff gets

1800
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,000
my picture is showing is hiding that stuff

1801
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:02,000
does get

1802
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,000
some stuff gets deleted some stuff

1803
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
doesn't

1804
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
but yes we do

1805
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
carry over

1806
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,000
things like your ranks

1807
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
your faction ranks those get merged

1808
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,000
and whatever the most favorable way for them to merge is

1809
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
but you do lose the

1810
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
a character found

1811
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
stash does vanish

1812
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
when you take a character from character found to normal

1813
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
the stash goes poof

1814
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
you gotta take everything you wanna carry

1815
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
with you on your back

1816
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
put on those four layers of shirts

1817
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
alright

1818
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
that's gonna do it for us here

1819
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:50,000
let's

1820
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,000
put this one last thing up if you missed it

1821
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:53,000
there it is

1822
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
super cool

1823
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
corruption display

1824
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:02,000
ooh I'm really happy about this

1825
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
alright

1826
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
I will be back

1827
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
with

1828
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I don't know who's actually gonna be on that stream or not

1829
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
some of us will be back

1830
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
with

1831
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
with try on the 8

1832
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
so same time

1833
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
on tries twitch

1834
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
talk to tries twitch

1835
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
not ours

1836
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
we might try and

1837
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
restream it or something

1838
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:27,000
just to

1839
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
so there's more

1840
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:29,000
it's out there more

1841
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
all sorts of stuff

1842
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I don't know what we're doing for next Friday

1843
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
I assume we're skipping next Friday on the 4th

1844
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
but I will double check

1845
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
and some announcement will go either way on that

1846
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:43,000
I had a great stream

1847
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
this was a ton of fun

1848
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
we're through it

1849
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:47,000
oh

1850
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I'm gonna go

1851
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,000
I think I'm gonna go set up a trampoline later

1852
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I hope you had fun

1853
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I know I did

1854
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
I'll see you next time

1855
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
let's go

1856
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
let's go say hi to someone

1857
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:06,000
oh

1858
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,000
here we go

1859
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,000
here's a familiar face

1860
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I pick familiar faces

1861
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
because if I pick just randoms

1862
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I get in trouble a lot

1863
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
because I make mistakes

1864
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:26,000
but yep

1865
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,000
have a great time everyone

1866
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
drink lots of water

1867
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
see you later

1868
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I'm gonna go

1869
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I'm gonna go
