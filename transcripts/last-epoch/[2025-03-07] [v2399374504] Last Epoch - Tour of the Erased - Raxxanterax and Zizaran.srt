49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
school to you know maybe maybe stay out of the house for a couple hours uh because they'll come

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
teaser trailer that could be something that you guys do for a couple minutes before we get into this

just so people have a good frame of reference for the stuff that we're talking about

79
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,000

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and there

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
perfect

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,000
all right

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
hi

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
scissorin here

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and we're doing a podcast

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
with 11 hour games

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and we're joined here

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
by some of the developers

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and i'm joined by rex

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
we're going to be doing an interview

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and talking about the upcoming

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
tombs of the erased

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
season two

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and this is

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
we're going to start off

195
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
with showing the

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
official trailer

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
so they have a better idea

198
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
what we're going to be looking at

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and talking about

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
you've come

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000

traveler

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and in this time

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
you can share

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
in her embrace

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:31,000
so

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
oh

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know.

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I gave him a 12 réps CREAL

211
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I did.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I çok меньше peur.

Let's go.

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's go.

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let's go.

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's go.

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Let's go.

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's go.

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's go.

221
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's go.

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's go.

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's go.

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Let's go.

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's go.

226
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's go.

Let's go.

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's go.

229
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Awesome.

230
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So, yeah, we are joined here by the devs and we have a lot of topics to cover.

231
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Very excited.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to join us here and answer a lot of questions about the game.

233
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think we'll start with some introductions just so everybody knows who's who.

234
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Judd, do you want to start?

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, absolutely.

236
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hello.

237
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
My name is Judd Kobler.

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I am the founder of 11th Hour Games, game director for Last Epoch.

239
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm located over here in Texas.

240
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I started 11th Hour Games back in 2017 through Reddit as just a diehard action RPG player.

241
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So I've been on the other side as a player for much longer than over on this side as a developer.

242
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, I'm excited to chat with you guys.

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Awesome.

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Ross?

245
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hey, I'm Ross, a creative director at 11th Hour Games.

246
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Just a bit about myself.

247
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I've worked on the front end design and implementation of a lot of different systems and features in the game,

248
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
plus a bunch of stuff outside of the game as well.

249
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I wasn't part of the OG Kickstarter crew.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I think I started contributing perhaps in patch 0.7.

251
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You know, this was a while back before we had things like idols, you know, we were using protections rather than resistances.

252
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So a while ago, but not all the way back to Kickstarter days.

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In terms of how I joined the company, it's definitely a slightly unusual process there.

254
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I remember looking at the last Epoch Kickstarter page when it was live.

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And my main takeaway from that was that, you know, the team seemed really genuine and I thought the systems design was really solid.

256
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I am ashamed to say I didn't actually back the project though.

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh.

258
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You know, in my defense, this was just before my son was born.

259
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So, you know, I was saving money for the baby.

260
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's what we'll go with.

261
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But yeah, sometime later, I saw one of your streams, Zez.

262
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And I think you were streaming with Mike and Judd.

263
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And yeah, that stream convinced me to dive in.

264
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The game looked better than it did at the Kickstarter phase.

265
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And yeah, when I played, I thought there was a real charm to the game.

266
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And I thought I would offer my help to the team.

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So I just started designing things and sending that across mostly to Judd initially.

268
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You know, I worked on elements that I knew the team could probably implement fairly quickly.

269
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Things like reworking tooltips, reworking the dialogue system and things like that.

270
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But in addition to that, I saw the team at a roadmap and I just started mocking up systems that were much further out there.

271
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You know, I just picked the eternity cache because I thought that sounded cool.

272
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And I started experimenting with what I thought that would be.

273
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
In the end, we didn't use my ideas there.

274
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Holly came up with something much better later on.

275
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But it did help to kickstart some of those conversations.

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And, you know, I started talking with Judd.

277
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And then eventually he convinced me to join the team later on.

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And here I am.

279
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It took me about two years of courting Ross to get him to come over from his previous position.

280
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He was this guy that like he would show up on Discord and like hand us gold.

281
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He would just be like, here's a better design for the thing that you're doing.

282
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And we're like, this is fantastic.

283
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And it took me two years.

284
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
About every three months I'd message Ross to be like, it's time to go.

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's time to come over.

286
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's time to come over.

287
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And finally, we've got him here.

288
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So a lot of the good quality updates that you guys see coming through is because of Ross.

289
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Great to have him.

290
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah.

291
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And I guess if I hadn't seen Ziz's stream there, maybe I wouldn't be here.

292
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You know, who knows?

293
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're welcome.

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No, that's awesome.

295
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Very, very cool.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Thank you, Ziz.

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Cheers.

298
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Holly?

299
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah.

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm the principal designer.

301
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I was there right at the start.

302
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I replied to one of those Reddit threads from JAD back in 2017 and got into it as just a company

303
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Discord at the time.

304
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So I've been there since then.

305
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm primarily a designer now, but it was, I was one of the only developers back then.

306
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So I implemented a lot of the base versions of the early systems, like the stats system, ability system, AI, things like that.

307
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And then design last epoch is a collaborative effort.

308
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So there aren't really many things that you just could point to and say, we've designed that as the whole thing.

309
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So I have come up with a base ideas and did a lot of the design work on systems like skill trees and item factions.

310
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Awesome.

311
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And a lot of people already know Rax, but Rax, do you want to do a quick introduction for yourself?

312
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm Rax.

313
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I wear a blue hoodie.

314
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I play ARPGs like this.

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's me.

316
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And I'm the blue counterpart to Rax.

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So together we are blue man group.

318
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
For those that don't know me, I also play a lot of ARPGs.

319
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So it's been a while since season one.

320
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's been a large gap.

321
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So yeah.

322
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Do you want to give us a TLDR on that, Jed?

323
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah.

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The gap between season one and season two was much longer than we'd like it to be and much longer than we'll be aiming for going forward.

326
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You know, I do hope that when people see the patch notes, they'll immediately know that we weren't just, you know, sitting idly.

327
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
A lot of great content coming out with season two.

328
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The reason that it took so long to get season two out is because it was clear what the community was asking for us to work on.

329
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And we decided to deviate from our prior season two plans to prioritize the addressing of the community feedback coming through.

330
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You know, people were asking for, you know, more things to do in the end game updates to dungeons, more balance, getting those crafting materials out of your inventory, etc.

331
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And, you know, while these were all things that we were planning to do over time, I think if we had proceeded with our prior season two content plans, we might have seen tone deaf if we were to have proceeded with that over addressing some of the wants coming from the community.

332
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So we took some additional time to address the biggest wants coming out there.

333
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And because of that, I think people are really going to enjoy the content coming out with season two.

334
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Awesome. And you mentioned seasons were going to be coming faster going forward.

335
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Like what kind of timeframe are we going to be looking at for like future updates?

336
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, that's definitely the plan. We're still aiming for that, you know, three to four month releases for these seasons.

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And we did take some time this development cycle to work on things that'll better set us up for success.

338
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
In that regard, we've done things like we've upgraded the engine so that doesn't become a roadblock going forward.

339
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That also gives us some some great performance wins alongside a lot of efficiencies internally for the working team.

340
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We have some of the team already working on future content, which is quite new for 11th hour games, as we've always been racing to get that next piece of content out the door.

341
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And we haven't found ourselves in the position to be working on content for further in the future than the upcoming immediate next patch.

342
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So that's that's very cool to see that we're now at that point.

343
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And then we've also been working on systems that will help us produce content more quickly, like our new procedural content generation engine, which is what powers the new tombs of the erased content, all of the procedural side zones that you'll encounter.

344
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And then I should probably say for for any viewers that don't know what procedural content generation is, it's basically a way for us to clear a set of rules and inputs to create content.

345
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And then we put that into the engine and the engine will spit out a random zone layout with encounters and events and things of that nature, which will be a huge, huge boon for us.

346
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
As previously, we were having to create all of these zones manually.

347
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And of course, one of the biggest challenges with creating an action RPG in seasonal content is just being able to deliver PVE content at high quality as fast as people can consume it.

348
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So that's going to be a huge boon for us.

349
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And are you aiming for like every three months, every four months, any idea on something like that?

350
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I think I think our ultimate goal is to get it down to three months.

351
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I think it's more reasonable to say four months is more what 11th hour games is capable at the moment.

352
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Again, we are continuing to create things that will just help us make sure that we can develop content more quickly.

353
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We're certainly not at the point where we want to rush things out the door and have things be buggy and broken and things like that.

354
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So, you know, with the team size that we have right now and the tools that are disposal, aim for three months.

355
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
If we land at like the four, four months or so timeframe, that's generally what we're happy with.

356
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Awesome. And then we have season two starts on 2nd of April. Is that right?

357
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
April 2nd.

358
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm very excited.

359
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,000
All right. So yeah, on that three or four month thing, every time, every time someone promises us three months, it ends up being four months anyway, it seems so.

360
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
We probably won't hold you to that.

361
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Producing TVE content.

362
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I mean, just the, if you think of the entire development cycle of a piece of action RPG seasonal content, if you think of everything that has to go through, be bug tested, be iterated on, get feedback on, scale test, bug fix, all that stuff.

363
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's a, it's a really challenging timeline to get that amount of content across the board that quickly.

364
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But we understand that it's important because people, of course, don't want to be sitting there with the same content for a long number of months without something new to do.

365
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah.

366
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And, and one of the first things that you said, you said you spent way more of your time as a player, rather than a developer, it'd be a cool, like different podcast.

367
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
If we could pick your brain on what is actually like the differences there.

368
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Cause you were like rattle off those.

369
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh yeah.

370
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah.

371
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah.

372
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah.

373
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah.

374
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah.

375
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Being on the other side is, is very, very interesting.

376
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You know, one of the main reasons I developed or created 11th hour games is because, um, you know, I had been a part of other ARPG communities in the past.

377
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And, uh, like Ross, I would go, we would go with groups of people and we would say, Hey, the game would be so much better if you would implement this thing.

378
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And we would provide mock-ups and, you know, we were just dying to get any responses from the developers.

379
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And we would be handing over things that, you know, community collaborated community agreed on would make the game much better, but it would be radio silence.

380
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And I really wanted to make a studio, an action RPG that I knew that I could build a team that would constantly listen to community feedback because nobody knows these games better than the players that are playing these games for hundreds and thousands of hours.

381
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Us as developers, we don't have time to play last epoch for a thousand hours in a quarter.

382
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Uh, we just, we just don't have the time because we're sitting there developing it.

383
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So it's in studio's best interest to, uh, intimately be listening to all of the player feedback coming through because generally they know better what needs to be done.

384
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Maybe not how to approach it all the time, but better what needs to be done for the game to be great.

385
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That's pretty true.

386
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Very well said.

387
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Okay.

388
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Well, why don't, uh, why, why don't we get into it here?

389
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
All of the cool new stuff.

390
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Why don't we talk about the tombs of the race that you just brought up, which I think are the new side dungeons, I guess, just that's way to phrase is, can you just give us an overall, uh, view of the system and how it's going to work for us?

391
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Yeah.

392
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Um, I'll, I'll, I'll do that for you, Rex.

393
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,000
No problem.

394
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Um, in terms of tombs of the race, uh, you know, with season two, we're introducing these new side zones.

395
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
These are the tombs and cemeteries of the race that you might've seen in the trailer.

396
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Um, these zones, as Judd mentioned, use our new procedural generation system.

397
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So each layout there is unique.

398
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Um, that's something we've not been able to do before, uh, and we're really keen to deploy elsewhere in future as well.

399
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Um, these zones are the main entry point to interact with all of the new end game systems and content that's coming for season two.

400
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Um, so we have a new end game faction to progress through the woven, uh, and a weaver tree that allows you to influence the monolith, uh,

401
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
both in terms of its rewards and its encounters.

402
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Uh, the theming for this season, uh, is based on the weaver, which we've only alluded to previously through things like the weavers will lower, uh, lower text.

403
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Um, she's a big old spider titan who's trying to shape the world, uh, into her own version.

404
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Uh, and she's busy gathering and experimenting with souls from raised timelines as a source of memories to shape this new world.

405
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So the new woven echoes that you'll be exploring are based on these weird experiments by the weaver.

406
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Uh, and we'll talk more about these shortly.

407
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So to summarize all of that, the start of the journey through the new end game content really begins when you start exploring these tombs and cemetery side zones.

408
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And did you say there's, there's a tree connected to it?

409
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So we get an end game tree.

410
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Is that what I'm hearing?

411
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yes.

412
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yes.

413
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yes.

414
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The weaver tree, you know, you'll be familiar with systems like this where you can, uh, you, you know, you can adjust, uh, the, the monolith, uh, and modify certain aspects of it.

415
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So these are in game stuff.

416
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
These are in monoliths.

417
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Will they be like separate, like islands or blocks that appear or will they be inside existing monoliths?

418
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And like, how often are we going to see them?

419
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So, uh, both tombs and cemeteries are in the monolith specifically.

420
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Uh, tombs spawn inside echoes, um, roughly about 50% of the time.

421
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Although there are some ways to influence that.

422
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Uh, cemeteries are rarer and they spawn as a passive echo type where completing the cemetery is the objective for that particular echo.

423
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Okay.

424
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So how do you complete them?

425
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And like, so is it like a full clear?

426
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Is there a boss?

427
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Do you have to do objectives?

428
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Do I have to pull levers?

429
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
How long do these things take?

430
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

431
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
When do you go?

432
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Yeah.

433
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,000
There's a boss.

434
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Uh, they're, they're a bit smaller than a regular echo, uh, but the layout's quite different using procedural generation.

435
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But it's, it's just a case of getting to the boss.

436
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You don't have any levers to press or secondary objectives.

437
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Definitely don't have to full clear them.

438
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Yeah.

439
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You know, in, in terms of, in terms of length, they're fairly short.

440
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Um, tombs are slightly smaller than the cemeteries, uh, and you can complete them, you know, in, in about a minute or so.

441
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It really depends on how fast you kill the boss.

442
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
If you're lower DPS, it'll take a bit longer.

443
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Uh, there are some specific woven echoes later on that utilize larger versions of tombs.

444
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Uh, but, you know, we'll get to that.

445
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Well, okay.

446
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So, how balanced is it that, like, a lot of min-maxers especially will, like, end up skipping things?

447
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Like, what's the rewards going to be like?

448
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, so we do think that exploring this content is going to be rewarding enough or icing for most players.

449
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I think in terms of, uh, you know, players that are just skipping content, you're trying to get to empowered mon-less as fast as possible before interacting with anything.

450
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's always going to be tough to make, uh, additions to the end game that those players are happy to pause and delay for.

451
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah.

452
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Um, but, but in terms of the specific rewards, uh, both zones have the chance to spawn treasure rooms with chests and caches.

453
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And as mentioned, the bosses, uh, the unique bosses for each, they drop their own unique items as well.

454
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Uh, you'll also start finding woven echoes as items, uh, when you progress through these.

455
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Um, and both of these zones are the main location where you pick up memory amber.

456
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Uh, this is the currency that you gain and spend in various ways to progress through the ranks of the woven faction.

457
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Uh, in terms of memory amber, uh, both zones have cocoons in them that when you destroy them, uh, that releases a soul.

458
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And then that soul seeks a nearby enemy and empowers it.

459
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Uh, those enemies gain a modifier, they gain more health and damage, and then they drop more memory amber on top of that.

460
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Uh, and yeah, the memory amber ties closely in with all of the various reward systems in tombs and in the faction as a whole.

461
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Uh, and I guess I'll pass it over to Holly, who'll, you know, talk about, uh, some systems that we haven't introduced so far.

462
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Uh, the idol enchantment system.

463
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Okay.

464
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Next.

465
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Um, so when you get to the end of a tomb or cemetery, uh, you'll be able to enchant an idol, specifically a class specific idol.

466
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So one of the ones that takes up three or four slots in the idol inventory.

467
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Uh, and that adds a random affix to it from a new pool.

468
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Uh, and also gives us an amount of weaver's touch.

469
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Weaver's touch is like weaver's will, but for idols instead of uniques.

470
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And it'll upgrade that extra affix it's added and also have a chance to add a new one.

471
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So you'll be able to get up to four affixes on your class specific idols now.

472
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And the third and fourth affix are from, uh, a new pool of affixes.

473
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So they're ones that haven't appeared in idols before.

474
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And like regular affixes, but unlike other idol affixes, these have seven tiers.

475
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So you can, they, they, they can upgrade with a weaver's touch system.

476
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Wow.

477
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So that's going to be kind of OP.

478
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That one wasn't in the trailer.

479
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That sounds incredible because before all the time we were just running around, just picking up these idols.

480
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And now we're going to actually be like enchanting.

481
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And it's almost like when we, when I talked to this is around the previous podcast about POE, about how much he likes the lab.

482
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's like using like the divine font at the lab to like upgrade your gems.

483
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
But this time we're doing it with idols.

484
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And then did you say you add like weaver's will on it.

485
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So then you go play and the idols power up even further after that.

486
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Did I hear that right?

487
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Yes.

488
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So it's just like weaver's will in that aspect.

489
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Um, but with weaver's will it's permanent.

490
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Once the item has that it's locked.

491
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Whereas with idols, you can take them back to, um, a tomb or cemetery and effectively respect them as if you're enchanting them from scratch.

492
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Uh, but that costs memory amber.

493
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So I can keep rerolling the same one.

494
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So if I found like a best in slot idol, I can like keep rolling it until it's perfect.

495
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes.

496
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It's just time.

497
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Um, because we, uh, we wanted to have this extra aspects and extra affixes on idols, but we didn't want to drastically increase the amount of RNG required to get a perfect idol.

498
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Which it would be if you had to randomize four affixes instead of two.

499
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah.

500
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah.

501
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah.

502
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And, uh, with the, with the tomb cemeteries and the bigger versions of tombs, they all have a different amount of times that you can, uh, you can enchant the idols as well.

503
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Uh, the, the tombs that you encounter most frequently, you just get one, you get one.

504
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Uh, yeah.

505
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Okay.

506
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Awesome.

507
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Initially, it sounds like an amazing system.

508
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So you spoke about woven echoes.

509
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
What exactly are those and how, how are those different from the regular echoes that we've experienced before?

510
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So woven echoes, um, are basically the, the, the closest comparison is unique maps in Path of Exile.

511
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Uh, they are bits of the weaver's new world, um, crafted out of the memories of the souls of the urays.

512
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Uh, they drop as items normally in tombs and cemeteries, but you can get them elsewhere as well from possessed enemies.

513
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Uh, and at the end of a cemetery of the raised is an altar to the weaver.

514
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And you can put, you can go there and slot your woven echoes into the timeline.

515
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And then you can run them like, uh, regular echoes.

516
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And some of them will have effects on other echoes around them.

517
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And they'll, they'll have new content like new bosses or new types of encounter.

518
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Uh, yeah.

519
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Awesome.

520
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Am I missing anything?

521
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Chad, can I trade this with other players?

522
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Not currently.

523
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So with the way the bazaar is set up, it's very much intended for, um, items that aren't identical to each other.

524
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Like, um, close comparison is runes.

525
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So if you have two runes of discovery, those are identical.

526
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And so if we had loads of listings on the bazaar of different runes of discovery, that wouldn't make a lot of sense.

527
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Uh, whereas if you've got loads of different, even versions of unique, there's going to have different roles, different amounts of LP.

528
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So it does make sense of them to show up here.

529
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Uh, woven echoes don't have roles on them.

530
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
We, we did consider it.

531
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Uh, but in the end, we decided to make them easy to organize in the inventory.

532
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And that meant that each copy would have to be identical.

533
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Can you gift them to friends if they're like, you're playing together and stuff like that?

534
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Uh, no, it's just like crafting materials, but you can run them with your friends like other echoes.

535
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Okay.

536
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And are multiple people able to use like the reward or is that just like the person, one person?

537
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yes.

538
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It, it normally drops for everyone.

539
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Oh, okay.

540
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Very cool.

541
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Um, and you were speaking about the, the new faction, the woven.

542
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Is that something you choose?

543
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So it's at odds with the other mechanics or is it like forgotten knights where you fight Amroth and it's separate?

544
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's like forgotten knights.

545
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So the way we split it up is we've got item factions and end game factions.

546
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Item factions and merchant's guild and circle of fortune.

547
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You pick one of the two and you don't get access to the other.

548
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
As end game factions, you just get all of them.

549
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Okay.

550
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And how do you progress it?

551
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Uh, you collect memory amber, which drops from enemies in tombs.

552
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It drops from possessed enemies.

553
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And you also progress by spending memory amber.

554
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's like favor in that respect.

555
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Awesome.

556
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Okay.

557
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So yeah, everyone's going to be progressing the woven.

558
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And it's not going to be like something exclusive and you'll be playing SSF or trip.

559
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's pretty cool to customizing end game.

560
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So you want everyone to have access to it.

561
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Makes perfect sense.

562
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Um, I saw in the trailer, you said champion enemies and new affixes.

563
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Can you tell us more about what those are or what we'll be experiencing?

564
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes.

565
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So champion enemies are basically, they're like mini bosses and rare enemies, uh, cross together.

566
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They're more powerful enemies that are based on existing enemy types, but they have new abilities and they have an extra random modifier, which adds a random ability to them.

567
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And then they always drop an item with a champion affix, uh, that goes in the sealed slot.

568
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But there are quite powerful effects there, like plus one maximum companion, uh, or piercing additional enemies with multi-shot, things like that.

569
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Um, and because they're sealed, that means that you can never get these on legendary items, which allows us to put a little bit more power budget into them.

570
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Ah, okay, cool.

571
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Can you get exalted IOS stats on these as well?

572
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yes, but because they're sealed, you can't change them afterwards.

573
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So you have to get them to drop exalted.

574
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Okay.

575
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So, sorry, go ahead.

576
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Even if they're exalted, I cannot merge this with a legendary potential no matter what, right?

577
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes, because they're sealed and the sealed affix has never taken into account for making legendries.

578
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Very cool.

579
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Sorry, Rex, go ahead.

580
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,000
No, no, no.

581
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Yeah, uh, from, so from a design aspect, it sounds like from what I'm hearing, these champion, uh, affixes that are going to be on these items are just super powerful.

582
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Um, is this something where you envision like design wise, how many of our item slots do you think people are going to want?

583
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Like with these champion affixes, like do you, is it going to be like a one or two kind of thing or, or people are going to be farming to try to get full champion affixes on all pieces of gear for all builds?

584
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So, they're quite build specific.

585
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So, firstly, some of them are more generic, but generally they're only going to be a few that are applicable to your build and each affix only drops for one slot.

586
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So, even if you want those champion affixes for your build, it's not going to take over all your itemization.

587
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's just going to be those slots you're farming.

588
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Very cool.

589
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Um, and there's new bosses and Uber Aberroth as well.

590
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Can you talk a little bit about that?

591
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And with Uber Aberroth in particular, there's going to be two difficulties now, right?

592
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
There's going to be normal Aberroth and Uber Aberroth.

593
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Um, what's the, what's the difficulty levels on the two, uh, Aberroth fights basically?

594
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So, Uber Aberroth is quite a lot harder.

595
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Uh, we have made some changes to base Aberroth, so it's not quite as difficult as it was, uh, back in 1-1 of the event patch.

596
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Uh, but Uber Aberroth is definitely a level above that.

597
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Uh, some of it's just numbers changes, but there are mechanic, there are mechanical changes as well.

598
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Uh, like extra things will show up in the fight.

599
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I don't want to spoil all of it, um, but it's definitely harder.

600
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Cool.

601
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And, and what about the, uh, the other bosses?

602
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Like, are they Uber Aberroth level or?

603
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So, uh, most Woven Echoes, because you're putting them into your, uh, timeline, like regular Echoes,

604
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
they do scale with Corruption, they do scale with your other Monolith mods.

605
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Uh, so the, the difficulty of those will be variable.

606
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Uh, if you put them in at low Corruption, almost certainly be easier than Aberroth,

607
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
but you can put them in at any Corruption, and because that scales infinitely, um, they can potentially be harder.

608
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Awesome.

609
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Cool.

610
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Um, thanks for, um, move on and talk about, um,

611
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
should we do crafting?

612
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Well, actually, are there any, uh, special unique rewards from Uber Aberroth that are different than a normal one?

613
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yes.

614
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So all the, uh, new endgame bosses we're adding through Woven Echoes do have new unique drops.

615
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Um, Uber Aberroth has two that only drop from him, and you have to kill Uber Aberroth to get those.

616
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Unless you're MG, in which case you can, you can buy them, but that's, it's not the same.

617
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's not the same.

618
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So, you don't have the same sense of accomplishment attached to that.

619
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Does Uber Aberroth still drop some items from the normal pool as well?

620
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yes.

621
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay.

622
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's regular Aberroth loot, and then more on top of that.

623
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Okay.

624
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Um, do some work crafting then.

625
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Are some of these unique, I, yeah, real quick, on the Uber Aberroth drop, you said he had two unique drops.

626
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Are these going to be, like, godly things?

627
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Are these going to be, like, mage blood or headhunter things where we've got to have these?

628
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Is it going to be, like, pinnacle items?

629
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
They're, they're definitely chase uniques.

630
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Uh, they're not quite headhunter level in terms of how they modify the, the way you play the game.

631
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Um, but they're definitely very powerful, and things that you will want to chase, uh, and get for your characters.

632
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Can they drop a legendary potential?

633
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yes.

634
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Awesome.

635
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
God, that's going to be fun.

636
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Okay, uh, let's move on to crafting, as Ziz said, and, uh, something that, uh, if I may speak from the community, I've heard it a million times, it's something you guys do very well.

637
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So, endgame set crafting.

638
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So, you shatter set items to get set shards.

639
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Um, I, I saw it from the video, but how exactly, what do we do with these shards?

640
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
How does this help us?

641
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Uh, this one's still me.

642
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yes.

643
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Okay.

644
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Um, these, they, they mostly work like regular shards.

645
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You craft them onto your items, uh, and then they get the, uh, they get set affixes.

646
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So, set affixes have a couple of the stats from the original set item.

647
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Not all of them, because that would, that would explain the tooltip.

648
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Um, but they also count as the item from that set.

649
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So, if you have a Velarchia Stormcrown and you shatter that and you get the Velarchia Stormcrown shards, you then put that onto a helmet.

650
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The helmet becomes Velarchia Stormcrown reforged.

651
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It has this extra, uh, set affix and it counts as Velarchia Stormcrown for the purpose of getting the set bonus.

652
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So, you can equip it with staff, uh, or with a, an exalted staff that has the equivalent affix there.

653
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So, that's basically competing with legendary potential then?

654
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Yes.

655
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Cool.

656
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
We're expecting these.

657
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And importantly, you can't craft these set affixes onto legendaries.

658
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah.

659
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So, it's, it's an alternate thing.

660
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
You can't just smush everything together in one item, because we want better to be item diversity.

661
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
For endgame builds.

662
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Very cool.

663
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And shout out to Holly on that, because that was one that we actually weren't sure that we were going to be able to get through for season two.

664
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And Holly really wanted it, so she put in some additional hours over the weekend to get that, uh, that system through.

665
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So, thank you, Holly, for that one.

666
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I, I wasn't the only person who worked on that.

667
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Like, uh, Justin did quite a lot as well.

668
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Yes, yes, yes.

669
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So, this actually opens up, like, this is like a whole new, like, paradigm with set items, right?

670
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Because when I, when I think of a set item, I think of, like, Diablo 2 or World of Warcraft, where, okay, I just pick up the eight pieces, I put them on, and I'm wearing the set.

671
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But now you're saying you can shatter it for the set affixes, apply it to other items with different stats, and now it becomes counting toward the set items.

672
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So, now it's like another layer of the itemization where you're trying to somehow figure out if there's a really powerful set bonus for your build, and how you could craft it into your items if the set item itself is not powerful.

673
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Right?

674
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah.

675
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah.

676
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Correct.

677
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Wow.

678
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So, they, they, they, they, go ahead, sorry, before you finished.

679
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:17,000
But the, the issue we had with set items for a long time, and the reason we couldn't just buff them to fix them, because a big part of the problem was that they were too weak.

680
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
But the underlying problem was that they were dead-ed items.

681
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
They're items where once you get it, you have that item, you can get better rolls, but essentially that slot's done now for your build.

682
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And that's very dangerous for the item system, especially because these are taking out multiple slots for each set.

683
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And compare this to unique items where you can get legendary potential.

684
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So, even once you've got it, it's not a dead end, there's still itemization to go.

685
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So, with set items, we wanted a way to get those set bonuses and the core of these set items and allow players to use them in a way that doesn't make that slot a dead end.

686
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I mean, that's actually a pretty brilliant solution because that's been like the age-old discussion about set items where, okay, you find it and you have it and the, and the progression is done.

687
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But also, it also solves the problem of, okay, if you want to put set items in the game, well, how exactly would you balance it?

688
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
If you make them godly, then they're just best in slot items.

689
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And if you make them suck, then sets are a meme.

690
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But now that you shatter them and now that you can craft them into other items, it almost like solves that.

691
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I don't know, man.

692
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm very impressed with that solution.

693
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I never thought of that.

694
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I never thought of that ever.

695
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Now that I'm a smart person, I'm kind of dumb.

696
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
But I don't know if I would have, I don't know if I would have got there.

697
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
That seems pretty smart to me, actually.

698
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That's good.

699
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That's very cool.

700
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
That's good.

701
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Mechanically, set items are very interesting.

702
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
They're cool to chase.

703
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
They're unique in terms of character, and we really wanted to be able to have set items in the game.

704
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
But for years and years, we were just very timid to add additional ones.

705
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Because, again, the problem that we're calling out here, where they're either best in slot or you just don't want them whatsoever.

706
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So, yeah, this is exciting for us.

707
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And then hopefully we'll be able to start developing more set items because the system now exists.

708
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And, yeah, I don't know if we mentioned, but these types of crafting rewards are, you know, they're at the end of specific Woven Echoes.

709
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So, you know, you complete a Woven Echo, a specific Woven Echo, and you get the ability to shatter set items there.

710
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah, and there's Woven Offerings as well, where you take two items, you sacrifice one, and you buff the other one.

711
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Do you improve it more than it currently is, or is this similar to, like, a Divine feature in Path of Exile 1?

712
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Like, how does it work?

713
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So, Divine, you're re-rolling it.

714
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And because we wanted this sort of feature for a while with re-rolling unique affixes,

715
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:03,000
but we wanted to do it in a way that doesn't drastically reduce the rarity of having a perfect unique.

716
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Because we've got the LP as well.

717
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And unlike exalted items, uniques don't have an affording potential amount.

718
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
We couldn't really consume legendary potential for this because the extra affix is almost always going to be better than re-rolling it.

719
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So, the way the system works is you're sacrificing another copy of the unique with equivalent legendary potential

720
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
or equivalent Weaver's Will plus affixes if it's a Weaver unique.

721
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So, that means that you're using two for one re-rolled one.

722
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And that means that we can still control the rarity of that through the normal truck face.

723
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Awesome.

724
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Cool.

725
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Okay.

726
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Anything else on that one?

727
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah.

728
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So, can we move on to a little bit about the new items and, like, chase uniques and stuff like that?

729
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Like, do you want to tease any, show any, talk about any?

730
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm very all about, like, chasing things down.

731
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Same.

732
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I don't know.

733
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Did we bring any tooltips to show?

734
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
You guys want to talk to you next for a second?

735
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
We can just talk about it, too.

736
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'll message our team and see if we might be able to get, like, a tooltip or two.

737
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Okay.

738
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Yeah.

739
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So, you know, in terms of Season 2, we've got 25, I think, new ekes.

740
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And eight of these are Weaver's Will specific uniques.

741
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You know, there are some really powerful ones, things that drop from Ubarabroth, and they're not random drops in the world.

742
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And there are a couple of specific uniques with some cool new effects, things that we haven't done before.

743
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Things like redirecting a percentage of damage taken to your minions, things like that.

744
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And, of course, there's different ways to craft uniques through Woven Echoes as well.

745
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Awesome.

746
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Cool.

747
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Okay.

748
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Well, while we look for, see if we have any tooltips for any teasers, there are, I think I saw three new crafting materials.

749
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I jotted them down here real quickly.

750
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Maybe we can just kind of rapid fire through all three of them and see how they're going to help us.

751
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So, Rune of Weaving transforms a small amount of the remaining Weaver's Will on a unique item to legendary affixes.

752
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Is this just a way to, like, accelerate what the Weaver's Will is giving us?

753
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So you don't have to put on a crappy item and play for an hour.

754
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Is that what that does?

755
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yes.

756
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And that's the main purpose, because, obviously, with the Weaver expansion, we want to have more Weaver's Will uniques.

757
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We want to drop them more frequently from the enemies in tombs and possessed enemies.

758
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So we didn't want players to feel like they had to keep equipping all of these items and all their item slots are taken up by these,

759
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
where they're just working out whether the item's going to be good for them.

760
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So, a lot of the time, the purpose of the Rune is to use it on a fresh Weaver's Will item.

761
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And then you can see what affixes it's getting first and decide whether you want to actually equip that and use it up to its full potential.

762
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And it's not just Weaver's Will uniques.

763
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You can also use it on idols that have been enchanted with Weaver's Touch and see where those came.

764
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Awesome.

765
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah, so that's definitely how I was feeling with the old Weaver's Will items.

766
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So I get a Weaver's Will pair of boots.

767
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I know almost always they're going to upgrade into crap that I'm not going to use.

768
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And in order to find out, I got to put the boots on and play with them for an hour.

769
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And I'm like, oh, this is terrible.

770
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm just never going to touch Weaver's items again.

771
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
But now this Rune is going to accelerate that so we can actually see what it gets.

772
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Okay, we have the Rune of Havoc.

773
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It shuffles the tiers of non-sealed affixes on an exalted item with four non-sealed affixes.

774
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
The tiers are preserved.

775
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
They can't be exactly the same.

776
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
They cannot be used on items with all the same tiers.

777
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So if it shuffles the tiers on an exalted item, does that mean, oh, I have movement speed over here,

778
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
but I have exalted fire resistance or something, and I don't want exalted fire resist.

779
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I want exalted movement speed.

780
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So you can shuffle it and try to move the exalt to the godly stat.

781
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Is that what's happening here?

782
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yes.

783
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yeah.

784
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So if it has two T7s and two T5s, it'll have two T7s and two T5s afterwards,

785
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
but which affixes those tiers are on will be shuffled around.

786
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So, yeah, that's the exact purpose.

787
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Mostly you've got something like boots that have T7 in one affix,

788
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
but you want that T7 to be on movement speed, and you shuffle it to get it there.

789
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And these are quite powerful.

790
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Like, this has a big effect on crafting exalted items and also crafting exalted items

791
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
before you combine them with a unique with LP and make it legendary.

792
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So these are relatively rare.

793
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
They're about as rare as a Rune of Ascendance.

794
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Oh, okay.

795
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
That's not too bad.

796
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I think it's amazing how these runes are, like, yeah,

797
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
specifically targeting, like, a lot of pain points that we had.

798
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Oh, I find exalts, and they're garbage.

799
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'll never use this.

800
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Or I find weaver's will.

801
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm not going to put it on to level it up.

802
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
But now I'll actually interact with these things.

803
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's great.

804
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Last one, Rune of Redemption.

805
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And then I think we got some goodies in the chat here.

806
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Rune of Redemption randomly changes the exalted affixes on an item into different affixes.

807
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
So it doesn't change the tiers of the affixes.

808
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So if you just get, if you get, like, a double exalt or something,

809
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
or a triple exalt and just hit all the garbage exalts, bam,

810
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Rune of Redemption, you try to hit the miracle stats, right?

811
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Exactly it.

812
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So often you get these item drops that feel hype because they've got lots of exalted affixes,

813
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
but it's like one's health regen, one's fire vets.

814
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Well, that can be what you're looking for with some builds.

815
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So often it's not, and being able to have the chance to re-roll that is good.

816
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's not quite as powerful as Rune of Havoc in terms of getting exactly what exalted affixes you want.

817
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But it can have a higher upside because with Rune of Havoc,

818
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
you've got to craft on the affix you want,

819
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
sometimes use a Rune of Removal and risk losing the exalted affix in the first place

820
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
to make room for the affix you want.

821
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Whereas with this, you can just roll into it with one Rune.

822
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Perfect.

823
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Awesome.

824
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Yeah.

825
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And the other cool thing about Rune of Havoc is that's the one method that you can get exalted affixes

826
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
that you can't normally get,

827
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
things like experimental affixes or the new set affixes as well.

828
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah.

829
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Yeah.

830
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
That's the only way to get exalted set affixes.

831
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So, I have all the images you sent ready to pop up as well.

832
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So, I can show them on stream.

833
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And we'll start with this one.

834
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Scissor of Atropos.

835
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Five Weaver's Will.

836
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That looks really cool.

837
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Gain a stack of Kismet when you direct to use a melee attack.

838
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,000
What's Kismet?

839
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Is that a class skill thing?

840
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Sounds like Kismet.

841
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah.

842
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's a buff that's unique to this item.

843
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So, the effects you see here are the full effects of Kismet.

844
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Ah.

845
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
When you use a throwing attack, consume stacks to gain eight throwing critical strike.

846
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Very cool.

847
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Per stack.

848
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Is there a max amount of stacks?

849
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yes.

850
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It's eight mental save as any old text.

851
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh, okay.

852
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Cool.

853
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Awesome.

854
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I will pop open another one.

855
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Then we have Klotho's Needle.

856
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Block chance is converted to parry chance.

857
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
25 melee crit.

858
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Multi per meter from the target up to five meters.

859
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
20 increased range with Fireman and Puncturer.

860
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
90 melee damage.

861
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
So, is this the same max Weaver's Will as on normal items?

862
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Like, it's not always five?

863
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yes.

864
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But Weaver's Will items still have an effective level for Weaver's Will, the same way that regular items have an effective level for Legendary Potential.

865
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And that affects how likely they are to roll with high Weaver's Will or high Legendary Potential.

866
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And so, it can roll with 28 Weaver's Will, but that's even less likely than a regular existing Weaver's Unique.

867
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Very cool.

868
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Can I ask a question here on these Uniques with the Weaver's Will?

869
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:17,000
So, when we play with this and we move through the Weaver's Will, does it add additional power to the existing affixes?

870
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Or does it add another affix that it pumps up?

871
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Or can it add multiple affixes?

872
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
It adds one or more new affixes, the same way that Weaver's Will does on existing items.

873
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Okay.

874
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So, it's not buffing up the existing affixes.

875
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's going to be something separate as you play with it on these.

876
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Yeah.

877
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Okay.

878
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And then, next up, we have Immortal Lies.

879
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
30% of hit damage taken from bosses and rare enemies is dealt over four seconds instead.

880
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
While you have more than 10% of your max health is delayed damage,

881
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
damage to health below your neuron threshold is reduced by 30%.

882
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Elite melee attack speed, 90 health and lots of strength.

883
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
This is one of the uber Abbey Uniques right here.

884
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
And actually, Ziz, are you showing the one that has the roll ranges attached to it?

885
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Let's see.

886
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I got a...

887
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
The team is feeding them to me right now.

888
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
It's one without ranges.

889
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I see.

890
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Yeah, both.

891
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Cool.

892
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Yeah, so Immortal Vice and Shattered Worlds are the two uber Abbey Uniques.

893
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And we have both of those with roll ranges on there.

894
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Oh.

895
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And so these are with legendary potential, not with Weaver's Will.

896
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Yeah, there's legendary potential.

897
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
The Weaver Fiend Uniques that you get inside tombs and from the tomb bosses,

898
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
those tend to be Weaver's Will, whereas the new uniques from Woven Echoes

899
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
with the other new bosses, new Brabbloth, are just regular legendary potential uniques.

900
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Cool.

901
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Can I ask something again about the Weaver's Will?

902
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So when you get one of these uber uniques with five Weaver's Will,

903
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
and it's going to add a new affix,

904
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,000
are all Weaver's Will items pulling from the same Weaver's Will affix pool?

905
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Or if we get a Weaver's Will item from Uber Abbey Uniques,

906
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
can it put like a special Weaver's Will affix that we can't see on other regular items?

907
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
The Weaver's Will always pulls from the regular affix pool for that item type.

908
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So if you've got a unique two-handed sword with Weaver's Will,

909
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
it'll apply regular two-handed sword affixes to it.

910
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Okay, so with our current knowledge of the game,

911
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
we should be able to plan out what would be the ultimate item,

912
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
like, oh, you have this sword and you want to hit,

913
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I don't know, melee damage again or something,

914
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and that would be the ultimate Giga Chat weapon.

915
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Yeah.

916
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Okay.

917
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And you can plan all of it out with any Weaver's Will Uniques.

918
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Awesome.

919
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'm also showing Shattered Worlds.

920
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
You are immune to Stho,

921
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
you have haste, 5% crit, 10 all the tributes,

922
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
100% infect of frenzy,

923
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and plus one all skills.

924
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And I actually really appreciate that you're showing the role

925
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
that I'm going to be dropping from my first kill.

926
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
So that was considered it.

927
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
It's missing the legendary potential that it's going to have,

928
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
but other than that...

929
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
This guy.

930
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
That looks nice.

931
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
That looks broken, actually.

932
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
That was very cool.

933
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I think we have one more that I didn't show.

934
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I don't think I showed this.

935
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I didn't show this, did I?

936
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I like how that one's all about going fast.

937
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Can't be slowed.

938
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You have haste.

939
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Double the frenzy.

940
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
You're just the crackhead.

941
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Must go fast.

942
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yeah, I don't think I showed this.

943
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Plus two Max Kelly mages.

944
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Nice.

945
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Wow.

946
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
That's like plus a lot of stuff.

947
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Very cool.

948
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
This is going to be very exciting with Weaver's Will.

949
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Yeah.

950
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Awesome.

951
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
That's one of the unique drops from one of the team bosses.

952
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Very cool.

953
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Yeah, thank you for showing those and teasing those.

954
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That's very cool.

955
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
For sure.

956
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I also got some of the new rune tooltips in here.

957
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
If we can spread those out later.

958
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
They're actually high-res ones.

959
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Because I think they...

960
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Did we show these in the trailer?

961
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I think...

962
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yeah.

963
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yeah, they're in the trailer.

964
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yeah.

965
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Okay.

966
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Real quick before we go to the next topic.

967
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Question on those runes.

968
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
When you use them,

969
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
do they have the opportunity

970
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
or do they consume forging potential on use?

971
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Do you need to have forging potential to use them?

972
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yeah.

973
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So fairly standard.

974
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
20 forging potential for both.

975
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
That's still potentially subject to change

976
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
based on balance testing.

977
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
But we think it's going to take us 20.

978
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Okay.

979
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Okay.

980
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Awesome.

981
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
So we have a rework.

982
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
The Sentinel rework.

983
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Can you give us more insights into that?

984
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Are these buffs or nerfs or new functionalities?

985
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I remember last season,

986
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
I had a thing on my stream called Forge Guard Friday.

987
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And believe me, I did.

988
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I haven't hated Fridays ever more in my life

989
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
than when I was forced to do Forge Guard Friday.

990
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I really hope we're getting some good news over there.

991
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,000
That's awesome.

992
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Apologies that Friday was hard on you,

993
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
but it shouldn't be that way going forward quite as much.

994
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Yeah.

995
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
We expect there's going to be a lot of new competitive builds

996
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
for Sentinels in season two.

997
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Generally, they will be more powerful than they were previously.

998
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
We have a big rework coming in for Volatile Reversal,

999
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
which of course was a very powerful skill.

1000
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
So we've been able to redistribute some of that power

1001
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
across the rest of the Sentinel class,

1002
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
which is giving it a lot more options here.

1003
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
For example, we've done things like we've given a big boost

1004
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
for Electrify builds.

1005
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
We've reworked Time Rot.

1006
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
It's quite powerful.

1007
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
It's much more well-supported throughout all the trees.

1008
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
We have some really cool additions to the passives,

1009
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
like the ability to wield a two-handed weapon

1010
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
alongside a shield at the same time.

1011
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So Forge Guard should be a little bit more fun with that.

1012
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And yeah, absolutely.

1013
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And we've got a lot of improvements,

1014
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
a lot of updates to the passive trees in general,

1015
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
especially for the Paladin and the Void Knight,

1016
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
as those haven't been touched in quite a long time.

1017
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So yeah, I think people are going to have a really good time.

1018
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
With the Sentinel reworks that are coming out this season.

1019
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And we'll be unveiling more just little pockets of passes

1020
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and stuff like that as we get closer to launch.

1021
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Awesome.

1022
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
It's just so much stuff that I'm looking forward to.

1023
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And one of the things I'm really looking forward to

1024
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
is Mastery Respec.

1025
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
What's the cost of that?

1026
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And also, thank you so much for allowing the Respec of Mastery.

1027
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
For those that don't know,

1028
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
that's the last Epox version of Ascendencies.

1029
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And you can respec those now.

1030
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Yeah, we were stubborn about changing this for quite a long time.

1031
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
We're the diehard ARPG fan base that's like,

1032
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
once you get a clash, you're absolutely that character.

1033
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And you can't change.

1034
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
You have to re-roll a character.

1035
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
We finally gave way.

1036
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It is a good user experience boost

1037
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
for people that don't want to be spending

1038
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
a significant amount of time re-rolling characters.

1039
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
So I think it is going to be very healthy for the game.

1040
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
In terms for the cost associated with this,

1041
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
it's fairly reasonable.

1042
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I don't have the exact numbers in front of me.

1043
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Ross or Holly, if you guys have any exact numbers here,

1044
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,000
we can share.

1045
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
But reasonable once you get to late,

1046
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
like late 80s, 90s, and stuff like that.

1047
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Ramps pretty significantly.

1048
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
But if you're a user experimenting with different masteries,

1049
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
you're not going to have a hard time swapping to something else

1050
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
if you decide that you've gone the wrong route.

1051
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Yeah, the last re-spec I did, I was level 85,

1052
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
and I think it was half a million gold.

1053
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Early on, it is very cheap, though.

1054
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
You should have enough gold initially, yeah.

1055
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Cool.

1056
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Yeah.

1057
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It goes up quite a bit after level 80.

1058
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
But it scales with the level.

1059
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's just gold.

1060
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
That's our stubbornness coming through,

1061
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
just at later levels.

1062
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I don't mind that it costs a lot.

1063
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I just want to be able to do it.

1064
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
You got to put your foot down at some point, right?

1065
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Okay.

1066
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I saw that you guys are giving us some new inventory tabs.

1067
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That's amazing.

1068
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And I thought I heard you say at the very beginning,

1069
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
you said something about crafting things going,

1070
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
like not being in our inventory.

1071
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Is there something there?

1072
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

1073
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
We've actually made a big update

1074
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
where when you pick up crafting materials,

1075
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
they will now automatically go to your crafting inventory,

1076
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
getting them out of your inventory panel

1077
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
and not having to transfer them before they go away.

1078
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I will say that this is a massive quality of life feel.

1079
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
It's probably one of my...

1080
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
It's such a simple change,

1081
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
but it's probably one of my very favorite things

1082
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
coming out with Season 2.

1083
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
That paired with the different stash tabs,

1084
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
you're just not having to do inventory management

1085
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
nearly as frequently as you had to previously,

1086
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and it feels very good.

1087
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Especially if you're playing on gamepad like I play

1088
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
because my wrists are all screwed up

1089
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
from playing these for thousands and thousands of hours.

1090
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yes.

1091
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Massive.

1092
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Yes.

1093
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Wow.

1094
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
So I remember that was maybe one of the first Reddit posts

1095
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I ever put on Last Epoch when I started playing.

1096
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I was like, can we please...

1097
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
So just to clarify,

1098
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
we're talking about the little vacuum button

1099
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
that we press all the time.

1100
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It just auto...

1101
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It says transfer,

1102
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
and then it goes into the crafting.

1103
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
That now is completely bypassed.

1104
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It is an option.

1105
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
So for those of you that really like

1106
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
pressing the transfer button,

1107
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I know there's a lot of you.

1108
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You can still do it,

1109
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
but for everybody else,

1110
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
they can go to the settings and check on,

1111
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
and it'll just go immediately to the crafting inventory.

1112
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Yeah.

1113
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
You can also...

1114
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
You can opt out of certain things for that.

1115
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Sorry.

1116
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
If you want rare crafting materials

1117
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
to always read them

1118
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
and make sure that you're understanding they're going in,

1119
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
you can exclude them

1120
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
from automatically being stashed,

1121
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
which is helpful.

1122
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Oh.

1123
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Awesome.

1124
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Or keys or waving echoes,

1125
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
but you can stash all of them if you want.

1126
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And it'll show the little tooltips

1127
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
up on the top left of the screen

1128
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
that it does when you manually click the store button.

1129
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So you do get that extra notification

1130
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
of what you're picking up.

1131
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Cool.

1132
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Beautiful.

1133
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Another thing that's being added

1134
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
is portal charms,

1135
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
which bypasses the dungeon,

1136
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
goes directly to the boss

1137
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
for like drool run and stuff like that.

1138
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Is this a one-time use

1139
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
or something I unlock

1140
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and then I can just skip the dungeon?

1141
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
They are consumable items.

1142
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Yep.

1143
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And we're adding a couple different portal charms.

1144
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:33,000
You know,

1145
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
we know the one that people are going to be

1146
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,000
the most excited about

1147
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
is the one that allows you

1148
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
to just skip directly to the boss on use.

1149
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Rarity-wise,

1150
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
they're about as rare as a rune of ascendance,

1151
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
but we also have a key vendor

1152
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
inside of Majelka

1153
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
where you can trade three

1154
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
of the different dungeon keys

1155
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
and then get a portal charm from that.

1156
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
So yeah,

1157
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
for people that are looking to skip the dungeon

1158
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
and are doing things like farming keys

1159
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,000
and stuff like that,

1160
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
you should have them fairly readily available.

1161
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Yeah.

1162
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
And do you need the key and the charm

1163
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
or do you only need the charm?

1164
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
You need the...

1165
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Yeah, you need both.

1166
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Yeah.

1167
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Awesome.

1168
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So I know tons of people

1169
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
are going to be super excited

1170
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
about the WASDE beta support.

1171
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
A lot of people play that way.

1172
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's a massive thing.

1173
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So I'm going to follow it up

1174
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
with a very, very pivotal question.

1175
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
So you guys got to be very careful

1176
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
with this answer here.

1177
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Is there any news about

1178
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Last Epoch coming to consoles?

1179
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
There's a lot of players out there

1180
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
that are dying for you to release it over there.

1181
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1182
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Well, okay.

1183
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'll start with WASDE.

1184
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
So WASDE is something, you know,

1185
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
recently people have gone and played in WASDE

1186
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
and there's a lot of people that says,

1187
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
you know, I'll never be able to play an action RPG

1188
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
without WASDE.

1189
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And so we did want to go and experiment with this

1190
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
and see how quickly we might be able

1191
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
to get a prototype of this across the line.

1192
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
We were actually able to prototype it fairly quickly

1193
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
and verify that it feels good.

1194
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And then we had to take a little bit more time

1195
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
to do all the user-facing, you know,

1196
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
input schemas and stuff like that.

1197
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It actually took a little bit longer

1198
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
than actually implementing that base functionality

1199
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,000
of WASDE.

1200
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
For consoles, nothing to announce currently.

1201
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But what I will say is that

1202
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
there is an absolute ton of work

1203
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
going into the gamepad experience for PC.

1204
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Lots and lots and lots of updates coming to UI.

1205
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Gamepad targeting, things of that nature.

1206
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Lots coming with Season 2.

1207
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But that's just the beginning.

1208
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
We are, we have ramped up that pipeline significantly.

1209
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So gamepad experience is going to be really solid in Nelly.

1210
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Cool. Awesome.

1211
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That's awesome.

1212
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Abarth as well is getting a lot of changes.

1213
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Is the base version a lot nerfed?

1214
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And like, what's, is the goal here

1215
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
to just make like the first version

1216
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
more accessible to people?

1217
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Tell me a little bit about that.

1218
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Yeah, it's, base Abarth is being nerfed a little bit.

1219
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
On top of that, you know,

1220
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
the power ceiling is rising just slightly

1221
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
with the addition of idle enchantments

1222
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
and, you know, a number of buffs

1223
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
to existing classes and skills.

1224
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So base Abarth, we want that to be something

1225
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
that an engaged player can pursue and get to.

1226
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Now, Uber Abarth is going to definitely be a chase kill

1227
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
for anybody that's really hardcore into the game.

1228
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Oh, actually, is there any like race or anything

1229
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
for the Uber Abarth?

1230
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
If Scissor wants to make one.

1231
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Oh.

1232
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Okay.

1233
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
We can maybe do that.

1234
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
All right.

1235
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
All right.

1236
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Let's talk.

1237
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Yeah.

1238
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Let's, let's see if we can do that.

1239
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Could be fun.

1240
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:54,000
All right.

1241
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Well, kind of kept this one short and sweet

1242
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
because there's going to be a whole month

1243
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
of these podcasts going on.

1244
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
We're doing one a week, right?

1245
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And the next one, I believe, is going to be with Gazzy.

1246
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So I assume all of those uniques that we saw in there

1247
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
about the minion stuff,

1248
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I'm sure he's going to dissect them in tremendous detail.

1249
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I think I speak on behalf of the community

1250
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
where we're just glad to see EHG and Last Epoch are back.

1251
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I consider this a wonderful update.

1252
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
It's clear that you guys, as you said,

1253
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
are we're not sitting around twiddling your thumbs.

1254
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
It's coming out April 2nd.

1255
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,000
That's correct.

1256
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Follow Zizarin everywhere.

1257
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
We're here on Zizarin's channel.

1258
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
He's on all social media.

1259
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And I don't know.

1260
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I had an amazing time here, guys.

1261
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Do you have anything else, Zizarin,

1262
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
you wanted to throw out there before we close out?

1263
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I do, yeah.

1264
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Make sure you follow Rax everywhere as well.

1265
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,000
He's also amazing.

1266
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Together, we're completely smurfed.

1267
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
The Blue Man Group.

1268
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Here we are.

1269
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The Blue Man Group.

1270
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Love it, guys.

1271
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Absolute pleasure.

1272
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Appreciate you guys having us on.

1273
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Always a good time talking.

1274
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Awesome.

1275
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Thanks so much for doing this.

1276
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And hopefully we'll do more talks in the future.

1277
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
All right, guys.

1278
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
See you in game April 2nd.

1279
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Cheers.

1280
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Bye.

1281
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I...
