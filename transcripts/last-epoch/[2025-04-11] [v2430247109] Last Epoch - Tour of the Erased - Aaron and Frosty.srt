1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I know when Echo was infiltrated your OBS.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Chat got some good memes.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Void night buffs were too strong at the game back.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Your audio is live apparently.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Testing, testing.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're testing, you know.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Why hello everyone and welcome to episode 10 of the Town Portal Podcast.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We had a couple of technical difficulties and hopefully all those technical difficulties have been taken out.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hopefully we're going to have a great show for everyone.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What a nightmare.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We had a bunch of people watching and then things didn't go as planned.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So hopefully everything is taken care of.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I had to rebuild all the scenes and get all the audio.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So we're going to test and see how everything sounds.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Judd, how are you doing today?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm doing very well, Aaron.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How are you doing today?

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Good.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Can everybody hear Judd without an echoing ring?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hello, hello, hello.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Fixed.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Perfect.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Great.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Great.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Lovely.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Amazing.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hey, listen.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Quick fix, right?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, it was a really quick fix.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I had to restart my computer twice, rebuild four different scenes, get all the cameras set up, get the audio set up, get the name tag set up, then retest it, then reboot the scene.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It only took a few seconds to get it going.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Mike, can you tell me about your morning routine, sir, so I could test your audio?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, my morning routine is very boring.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I roll out of bed and have a snack and turn on my computer.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's about it.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What about for breakfast?

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What do you eat for breakfast?

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I get these little things called Aussie bites.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
They're like, I don't know, there's like grains and seeds and stuff in them and they're delicious.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have a little protein shake.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That sounds good.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I like your shirt too.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Everyone's going to want one of those.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Carve, talk to me about your morning routine.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't roll out of bed before I, you know, stay there for at least half an hour after waking up because I just can't get myself up.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So you would say you're more of a night person?

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I mean, it's like almost midnight right now for me.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, I would say so.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, that's fair.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Ross.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's like 1am when I go to sleep usually after work day.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So yeah.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ross, what about your morning routine?

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, at the moment my routine is waking up at 1pm because of time zones.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And at the moment it's very sunny in Scotland.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So at the moment I wake up, go to the beach, have a relax, then come back and start working.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You wait, wait a second.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You wake up and go to the beach every day?

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, at the moment, yeah.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You know, you need to take, when there's good weather over here, you need to take advantage of it because there's not that much.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So yeah, that's what I'm doing at the moment.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, that is fair.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Uh, Frosty, how are you doing good, sir?

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm good.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I wake up 3am Scotland time, go out, get my paper, come back in, put my pants on, get ready for work.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You know, typical morning routine.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Just the normal stuff?

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, awesome.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm too loud.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're a bit loud?

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I got you.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know, one person said I'm loud, so...

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, you're a little loud.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I got you.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Testing, testing.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
One, two, three.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Gentlemen, I think we are officially good to go.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
All right.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hello everybody and welcome to episode 10 of the Town Portal Podcast.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm so excited today to have Judd, Mike, Ross and Carve with us.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is the last tour of the Erased Podcast.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And again, I apologize for the technical difficulties.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Today, we're going to be talking about all things season two, Tombs of the Erased, and maybe a little of the beyond.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Today, EHG might have broken a record with releasing 100 pages of patch notes, which is absolutely insane.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I think we made it through like one-third, four hours leading into this podcast, which is very, very cool.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So we're going to be discussing that today.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Frosty, why don't you say hello to everyone, sir, and do some introductions?

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All right.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is the most people we've had on at once, so maybe I might lose breath here, but...

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thanks, Aaron.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm beyond hyped for today's episode, because we've got not one, not two, not three, but four absolute legends from 11th Hour Games joining us.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The brilliant minds behind what is arguably the best ARPG of all time, Last Epoch.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
First up, we've got Judd, the founder of 11th Hour Games and game director of Last Epoch.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This man is an absolute gigachad.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He'll give you a thumbs up if he catches you playing Last Epoch on the job, and honestly, that's the kind of leadership I can fully support.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Next, we've got Ross, the creative director.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He's the hero secretly pushing for your favorite specs to get massive buffs, all while allegedly rescuing puppies in his spare time.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Then we have Mike, the senior technical game designer, Twitch streamer, and the proud holder of the best beer title three years running.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, wow.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Honestly, dude, I'm jealous.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And last, but not least, Carve.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The man, the myth, the legend, a game designer who's been leaking so many exciting features from this upcoming patch.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We're honestly just pumped to hear what you've got in store for us today.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It is an absolute honor having you all here.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Please say hi and introduce yourselves in case I missed anything.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, hey, everybody.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
My name is Judd Kobler.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm the game director for Last Epoch and founder of 11th Hour Games.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Really excited to chat with everybody today about the upcoming season two release.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hello, I'm Ross, creator director at EHG.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I've been working in the game since I think the 0.7 series of patches, mostly just because I wanted to help out at that time.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But then I officially joined later.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I think it was 2022, something like that.

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've worked on the design and front end of most of the game systems over the years.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hello, I'm Mike.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm a technical designer here.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And yeah, I've been around most of the time, not quite since the very start, but pretty close.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah, I'm just thrilled about this new patch.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's always fun.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm a big fan of patch day and it's fast approaching.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hi, I'm Carv, or I guess some people call me Ilka, but nobody at the work.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Nobody can pronounce the name.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And I'm just a nerd who apparently is worth listening to, I guess.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Very, very cool.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, thank you guys for joining us today and give us the opportunity to share everything that's coming.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We thought we would just rip the bandaid off with the first question.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is a question that's asked him, asked her, I guess more of it's a statement.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There's a lot of buzz around season two.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's been nine months in the waiting for this highly anticipated update.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And we know that unfortunately, maybe in the past, EHG has suffered with some server problems.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So knowing that there might be 100, 200, 300 people in my chat think you're going to have 500,000 concurrent players.

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We just kind of wanted to start with how servers are feeling.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How confident is EHG with the amount of players that likely will be coming and just see what you guys have done to plan for servers.

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, our back end team is feeling really good.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We've continued to improve our back end infrastructure since the launch of 1.0.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You know, now we're doing this with live data and real scenarios and that's allowed us to fortify these things under actual conditions that we'll see in the wild.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We've done things like we've improved our monitoring capabilities.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We've reduced our server memory spikes.

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We reduced the weight of servers just in general.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And this, of course, we've also done a lot of stress testing and other things like scaling speed and civil service fail state mitigations, etc.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And so, you know, if anything does go awry with the servers at the launch of season two, we're all going to be at our battle stations ready to fix things very quickly.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But yeah, feeling good in that regard.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay, so no one's taken off to play Last Epoch.

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There's no vacations right now on the 17th.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We'll all be playing and sitting there and monitoring things very closely.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So yeah, we'll be joining you guys on launch.

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
All right, great.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I've been seeing a lot of your promotional materials, the videos.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Is it me or is it looking a lot better graphically in this new season?

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Have you guys done any changes?

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What have you done?

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And is this something you're going to be continuing to do going forward?

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There's extensive updates in this regard.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We do suspect that these will be noticeable.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We've got this massive internal campaign going through and auditing all of the player animations and combat sounds and updating those.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We're still replacing all of our enemy and VFX that aren't up to our new much higher level of quality.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And you'll be seeing a lot more of this in upcoming season releases as well.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But yeah, with the release of season two, Last Epoch is looking and sounding better than it ever has for sure.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ross, you've been working very closely in those pipelines.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If there's anything specific you'd like to add to that?

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So as you mentioned, Judd, every season comes with visual upgrades as we update older content.

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Most of these improvements aren't generally attached to a specific season as a goal.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We just continually work to improve visuals.

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There are some exceptions where we might target a specific large visual improvement project to a release.

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Like when we updated the player shadows and lighting at 1.0 or when we added environmental variants to echoes.

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Updating the engine helps with our options here as well.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In terms of VFX updates, we target both player VFX and enemy VFX for improvement.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And depending on how old a particular effect is, reworking it can result in abilities looking better and performing better.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And being clearer in terms of visual weight and clarity.

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I think visual clarity is always important, but especially so as you continue to add more complex mechanics to the game.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
On the sound effects side, it's a similar sort of thing there.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We either update older sounds because the sound team have targeted that for improvement.

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Or because there is a visual rework of something that, you know, facilitates the need to update the sound there.

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
On the environmental side of things, in terms of level design and textures.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We are in the process of a big push there in terms of both the fidelity and clarity when it comes to things like ground textures and contrast.

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Which has a big impact on overall readability when it comes to combat.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So yeah, as Judd said, you'll continue to see improvements across the board here with each season.

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Now, recently EHG has done an engine upgrade.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And you've basically gone to a newer version of Unity.

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Has that unlocked more potential for what you can do as designers?

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's certainly been aspects of the engine upgrades that gives us more insight into, you know,

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
what we're, what we're, what the code is doing to a deeper degree and what we are able to push going forward.

191
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
There's, you know, upgrading the engine gives a lot of internal ability to improve things.

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Sometimes it does come with performance upgrades as well.

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Those are things that we're always excited about.

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And yeah, yeah. Upgrading the engine is important and something that we do from time to time.

195
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay. Cool.

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thirteen pages of bug fixes.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How important were getting these bugs taken care of before season two?

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah, the really, really important, right?

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We want people to know that we're going to be pushing higher and higher quality content as the studio and game mature.

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Lots of bug fixes coming in season two.

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And although there, there will likely always be some bugs floating around.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We've got more dedicated resources for bug fixing than we ever have by a large margin.

203
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
On that note, if you, if you guys end up finding any bugs in game, please do use that in game bug reporting system.

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's super helpful to us. It gives us your logs and character information, which helps us find it and fix bugs, you know, literally a thousand times faster.

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So if you guys see something, say something for sure. And it's always much appreciated.

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Nice. Nice. Cool.

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So, I mean, I didn't get a chance to read all the notes, believe it or not.

208
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I think there's like a hundred pages.

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Along with the 13 pages of bug fixes, I saw like massive amount of buffs for underused abilities.

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Now, I know this is just like a blanket question everyone can answer.

211
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you guys looking forward to any particular ability specifically that has been buffed to play with in this upcoming season?

212
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And everyone can answer one with their favorite one.

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, it's not buffed.

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Like, well, it's buffed slightly from a damage perspective, but we, we updated lightning blast to actually a chain, you know, and that, that really helps.

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So like rather than hitting all enemies at the same time, it's, it sequentially changes, which makes it a lot more satisfying.

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I think there's a few affixes we've added for this as well. So I'll be, I'll be trying lightning blast.

217
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
For me, I'm really excited to be trying out symbols of hope. Now that the functionality has changed, I think that's going to be a major improvement to the central skillset.

218
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So really, really excited about symbols.

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
There's some like little buffs to smelters wrath and there's, there's potential and then ability hills.

220
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So I'm still, I'm looking forward to eventually what that's going to become.

221
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
For me, it's probably gonna, I'm most excited for turning judgments, conscroning.

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Judgments, conscroning ground to aura.

223
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Now that I don't need to dump my entire mana pool anymore, because that normal change to not dump your mana pool anymore.

224
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And since volatile reversal doesn't immediately give your mana back all now.

225
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So you can actually use some other skills and don't need to worry about the, uh, the volatile reversal stuff.

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Carve, I know what you're doing. You're trying to bring a true RF to last epoch.

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't try and fool anybody. We know what you're doing. Come on.

228
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We have a couple of skills that are basically like, like Righteous Fire.

229
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That being one of them. And one of the uniques.

230
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Coming for Acolytes. I think QCU somewhat similar, similar playstyle.

231
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh boy. Uh, Frosty, I can tell you that I'm probably going to be the only content creator in the world that's going to be playing Summon Bear for my season start.

232
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
We are going to make a Primalist Beastmaster Summon Bear build.

233
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I mean, I'm probably going along with majority of people that I've talked to and just going Heart Seeker because I love bows and that is, I'm so happy with that.

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I am so unbelievably happy with that. That's hands down what I'm going.

235
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm going. Very nice. All right, guys. I don't know who wants to tackle this question.

236
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I feel like once season two comes out, there's going to be a lot of questions around this.

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
WASD movement in beta form. What's the future of WASD in last epoch?

238
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Potential strafing, using right thumbstick to shoot as you move backwards.

239
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What are, what's the kind of future vision of WASD?

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, I can, I can answer this one here.

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's so the, there's a lot on the table and a lot up in the air.

242
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So what it's going to look like at the very end of the line of like, what's, when do we take that beta tag off of the feature type thing?

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Um, it's, it's such a, like, it's such a field dependent thing.

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So we need to, uh, we need to make sure that the changes that we're making are things that feel good and things that feel good in last epoch specifically.

245
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Um, so, and, and there's so many abilities that interact differently with this type of, um, like input movement.

246
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And, and actually adding in active strafing to abilities is a huge power spike to a lot of, a lot of situations.

247
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And so like, it's, it's on the table, um, but it is not guaranteed.

248
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So we are, we are going to be testing things out and seeing what feels best.

249
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Um, there's, there's also like a lot of animation, uh, requirements for, for people.

250
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Uh, requirements for, for doing that.

251
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And we are, we do have some new tools from animations coming down the pipe that are really, uh, really big upgrades for the visual fidelity and also just, yeah.

252
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How they feel in game when you're using them.

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Um, it's going to help us make this feel a lot better going forward.

254
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Once we, once we do get that beta tag off.

255
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah.

256
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah.

257
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There's a, there's a, there's a level design aspect to this too, as well, where you need to, you know, we, we, we need to adjust areas to feel good with WSD as well.

258
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Um, we're doing that for all of the new areas that we're creating.

259
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So tombs and cemeteries and, uh, in future seasons.

260
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Um, but we will need to revisit some specific, uh, areas in the campaign and in monolith as well to ensure that the level is laid out to work well with WSD.

261
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Nice.

262
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Cool.

263
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Um, you know, I just got to get this out of the way first.

264
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is a massive, massive patch, massive season.

265
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There's so much being added is everything that's being added now going to be permanent and also available for legacy servers.

266
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

267
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Everything that we're adding right now is permanent content.

268
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Uh, we think it's a very important to make sure that the game is stacked with, uh, fun content.

269
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And when we released 1.0, we didn't quite have enough to start to introduce temporary mechanics, uh, temporary are introducing temporary mechanics or systems with seasonal releases is likely something we'll do.

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Because there is large benefit to doing that.

271
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You can release something, have it tested, see what sentiment is like, and you don't have any commitment to keeping it in the game.

272
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Or if people don't like it, you could of course pull it.

273
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Uh, so it is likely something that we end up doing long term, but right now all of the content coming into the game is, uh, intended to be permanent.

274
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah.

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Okay, great.

276
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I think there's one exception.

277
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This isn't anything to do with actual content.

278
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Uh, it's just that the, the chat announcements, the seasonal chat announcements do not, uh, happen in legacy.

279
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So there's one different thing.

280
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, yes.

281
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And what are, what are those announcements going to be, Karv?

282
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hmm.

283
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Probably going to see me die in hardcore.

284
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh, geez.

285
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Loot lizards got hit with a pretty big nerf, uh, 40% reduction.

286
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What would people expect, uh, the loot increase to be?

287
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So right now you probably see a couple of loot lizards, almost every echo.

288
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Uh, are we going to be super excited to see them from the loot that they drop?

289
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Um, I mean, they've, they've got a ton of really great loot already.

290
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Um, we're not actually buffing the loot on them a ton.

291
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Uh, there's, there's a lot of new methods, uh, for you to get, uh, for you to get access

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
to loot lizards.

293
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So you can like, you can spawn them in your, in your echo webs through the weaver tree.

294
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Uh, you can also, um, uh, there's, there's, oh, the, the, the scale charm as well.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Um, so there's lots of new ways and there's definitely not a bunch of pings happening right now

296
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
as distracting me or anything.

297
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Um, yeah, you're telling me.

298
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There's a lot of new ways to get, uh, to get access to loot lizards when you really want

299
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
them a lot.

300
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So you're still gonna be able to spawn a whole bunch of them.

301
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Um, but they'll just spawn less, uh, consistently and just randomly and you'll stumble across

302
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
them a little bit less.

303
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah.

304
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
One big point of feedback was that the loot lizards were like extremely saturated in campaign.

305
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So the, the reduction in amount of loot lizards you find is mostly notable on campaign,

306
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
because with the weaver tree, uh, and then there might be a woven echo that contains

307
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
loot lizards.

308
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Uh, you can in end game get a decent amount of loot lizards still.

309
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Well, uh, speaking of looting campaign, um, I know these champion monsters, these like

310
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
mini boss type monsters that have been added to the game will be in campaign.

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
They have a potential of dropping.

312
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I think it was a pile of uniques.

313
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Is this something that could possibly happen in the very early stages of your new character

314
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
in a campaign?

315
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes.

316
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm actually not.

317
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm not, I'm not sure actually.

318
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Can we ask Holly that and we can get back to you on the answer to that?

319
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah.

320
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I suspect the answer is yes, but I'm not.

321
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
They are difficult.

322
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
They're difficult.

323
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And if you're, if you don't have any, like, if you're not going to be like year from previous

324
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
characters and you're like a fresh start character and you see one right at the start or as early

325
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
as they can be seen, they are quite difficult.

326
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Uh, while waiting for that answer, uh, when you guys see loot lizards or hear them, does

327
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
anybody else hear dolphins?

328
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Somebody at EHG must hear a dolphin.

329
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I can't be the only person.

330
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You might be the only person.

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
No way.

332
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Mike says yes.

333
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I hear you coming from there.

334
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah.

335
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay.

336
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Okay.

337
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's like a dolphin and a murloc had a baby.

338
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes.

339
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Okay.

340
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Perfect.

341
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I would accept that.

342
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
They can't, they can drop a pile of uniques very early.

343
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Okay.

344
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Uh, like a pile of exalted items as well.

345
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Uh, some of the loot drop types are in game only, but unique.

346
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But unique.

347
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
All right.

348
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The pile of exalted.

349
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's great news for speed runners.

350
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

351
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You're not getting pile specs all the items on the campaign.

352
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

353
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But uniques can be at any level.

354
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah.

355
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay.

356
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So there's been a lot of shift on loot drops more towards magic and rare enemies as

357
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
well as making those enemies tougher.

358
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What prompted that change in our other loot pools?

359
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Um, going to change maybe in the future, or is that kind of where, where you want to take

360
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
loot?

361
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Hmm.

362
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Well, we don't have anything to really share about future loot ball changes right now.

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.

364
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
As for the, the question about the magic and rare enemies, uh, it just, it just improves

365
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
the, the feel and flow of the game a lot.

366
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You know, you fight these not normal enemies and then they'll drop some, you know, a bit

367
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
better loot compared to everything else.

368
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And you don't have to be clicking these shards and runes and whatnot that normal enemies

369
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
currently drop quite often.

370
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So it just means that you loot a lot less often.

371
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So it just, it just feels better.

372
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, that's it.

373
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It just feels better.

374
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That's what we found out when we tested it.

375
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Okay.

376
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Nice.

377
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So these new woven echoes seem really cool.

378
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is there a way of getting them, I don't know, through the auction house or the merchants

379
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
guild or increasing drop rate through circle of fortune, or does everyone have kind of

380
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
like an even playing field?

381
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah.

382
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah.

383
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
They're, they're, they're, they're, they're not tradable.

384
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can't, you can't get them in the bazaar.

385
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Uh, circle of fortune players will get a bit more of them through their perks.

386
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Uh, but other than that, they are pretty equal.

387
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Okay.

388
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Some major changes were made to enemy dot.

389
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So damage over time, a 50% reduction in corruption scaling as well as 15% less damage to players

390
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
was dot over tuned or was it just requiring too much of a gear commitment?

391
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I mean, both.

392
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
They, they, we, we don't, we don't have, it's a lot easier to mitigate hits.

393
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
There's a lot more systems that specifically mitigate hits.

394
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So if we, there's a couple of different ways to go about it.

395
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
We could provide a lot more the ways to mitigate dot, or we could just make dots be less dangerous.

396
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So you don't have to go out of your way on already very limited pool of affixes to start

397
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
tanking all of the dots.

398
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So we just felt it was better to not put more pressure on that.

399
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And instead just overall reduce the damage and dots there.

400
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Obviously you still probably want to have, you know, a source of cleansing for all the elements, uh, in the end game.

401
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I feel like this is going to be something that players really feel and notice when they play end game for last epoch.

402
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Most of the time when you die, it's like a poison or bleed nemesis, or it's gas bar or some dot that like smokes through all your, uh, defenses.

403
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So I think this is going to be a great change.

404
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, I think, I think we were about halfway through the development process for the season.

405
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Uh, and I had a, you know, a distinct memory of watching some streamers, uh, specifically, you know, a specifically struggling here.

406
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I think it was, I think it was Karn, uh, as well.

407
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It was like quite passionate about telegos, uh, with this.

408
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Um, but yeah, like, uh, I think the changes here are really, really positive.

409
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah.

410
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
There's also other things we can do.

411
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And if you have actually done, uh, in a lot of enemies recently where, uh, when a dot spawns, it doesn't do it's like maximum damage immediately.

412
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And it just ramps up.

413
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So if you're standing on it at the beginning when it spawns, it doesn't necessarily do all its damage.

414
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And then if you just, you know, AFK there, obviously you're going to die.

415
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Or if you walk onto it later, it's going to be way more dangerous to, uh, help so that when they spawn, you don't immediately have to, you know, be ready to dive out potentially.

416
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And it gives you a bit more leeway there.

417
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
So we're getting some pretty, uh, some pretty cool news in from the team right now.

418
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And I promise this is the script that are planned.

419
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Uh, the team is pinging us right now saying that our stretch build has passed QA.

420
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And so we will actually be adding, uh, another list of patch notes that were not included initially.

421
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And we can show some cool things that we are excited to get in that we weren't sure was going to come on day one, but we have some, uh, uh, it looks like photon.

422
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Pushed in some new visuals for the monolith hub, which is really cool.

423
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
This is, this is, this is pretty neat.

424
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
We're all very excited about this.

425
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And then, uh, we'll ask them to post the additional past patch notes in the discord for us.

426
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So we can go over those too.

427
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And then we'll have to actually add them to the patch notes themselves.

428
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah.

429
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
They, they will be.

430
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
How many more pages of Pat?

431
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So we're at a hundred.

432
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh, it's not, not, not.

433
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yeah.

434
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It's like, it's like one additional page.

435
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Okay.

436
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But they're good.

437
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
They're good.

438
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Nice.

439
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah.

440
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'll take that.

441
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's awesome.

442
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That is very cool.

443
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Pulling the first hot fix into the launch build.

444
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yep.

445
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Yep.

446
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Okay.

447
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Sweet.

448
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Frosty.

449
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What are you guys?

450
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, okay.

451
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I have a lot of time coming up to play a lot.

452
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So thank you for the mastery respec.

453
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Because I would like to be able to maybe switch my mastery without leveling up a whole new character to like 90.

454
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I think I saw on the video, like a high level characters, like half a million gold or something.

455
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's definitely attainable.

456
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What made you decide to allow mastery respec.

457
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And just before someone answers that question, if you are out there and don't know, Frosty LaRue's wife is due tomorrow with their first baby.

458
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So they're having a baby girl.

459
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So he wasn't even sure if he was going to make it for today's podcast, but just huge congratulations.

460
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Excited for you.

461
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Thank you.

462
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Excited for you guys.

463
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And EHG, everyone in chat is saying that he should name his daughter Ellie.

464
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Get it?

465
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's not very funny.

466
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
All right.

467
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I think I'm thinking Abera.

468
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Sponsored.

469
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Sponsored for sure.

470
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Abby could be another.

471
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Abby could be another good one.

472
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Abby's good one too.

473
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, there you go.

474
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
That's true.

475
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yeah.

476
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, so with respect for the mastery respec, it's one of those things that people, it was

477
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
a pain point for some people who are like starting out and all they do is just look at the,

478
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
maybe the broad theming of a class and they're like, oh, that's something I played in another

479
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
game.

480
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And you dive right in, you get to end game and it's not like maybe we've taken the class

481
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
in a different direction than you're expecting or something like that.

482
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And you're like, oh, I wish I'd actually taken a beast master instead of a druid or something

483
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
like that.

484
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And just that like that little shift.

485
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And then on your very first character, you look back and it took you so many hours to

486
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
do the campaign.

487
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So it was near done it before.

488
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And there's like that big pain point moment.

489
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And, and we just didn't want people to bounce out of the game right then.

490
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Um, and so this was, this was a really good opportunity to give people a way to keep playing

491
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and keep experiencing and keep evolving their character.

492
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Um, and you know, like we wanted the cost to be something that was, you know, significant

493
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
enough that it's not, uh, just a, Hey, I'm going to go switch my mastery today.

494
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Cause I feel like it.

495
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Um, but not so debilitating that you're like, okay, I'm going to farm for this week so I

496
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
can afford my mastery respect next week.

497
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Um, and, and you know, it's, it's a new thing and we're going to be paying attention to feedback

498
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and making adjustments as we need to here going forward.

499
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Um, but yeah, it's, it's something that we're using more as like a relief valve for fixing

500
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
a, like a mistake rather than like a tool to be leveraged.

501
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And I think the really big like similarity here is the being able to switch between COF

502
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and MG.

503
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And like, that's not something I see a lot of people being like, I'm going to leverage

504
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
these two together to switch back and forth.

505
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And that's sort of the relationship we want is where it's a, the fixing a pain point for

506
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
players, not really a tool.

507
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Uh, tools for like to be followed and build guides so much.

508
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And like, I'm sure it'll pop up from time to time in these places, but, um, expecting

509
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
more one way switches than repeat switches.

510
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm happy that you guys put it in the game, but I'm going to, I'm not going to lie.

511
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I was pretty surprised.

512
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
This was one of those questions, Mike, that you've gotten for five years where it's always

513
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
been like, nah, uh, we want something to be all permanent.

514
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So it was, it was a nice surprise, but I was surprised.

515
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yep.

516
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah.

517
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We, we, we have to stay flexible and we have to be ready to change and adapt.

518
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And I think this is a good, uh, good example of that.

519
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Um, you know, we're going to keep making the best decisions for the game in its current

520
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
state.

521
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Nice.

522
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

523
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Well, um, yeah, I think as long as you don't, you can't, uh, you know, map a mage into a

524
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
sentinel would be probably good here.

525
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So can't swap the class.

526
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I agree.

527
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah.

528
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Right.

529
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Uh, something that's been coming up more and more when everybody's watching these trailers,

530
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
looking at the patch notes is power creep.

531
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So with the, uh, with the introduction of being able to enchant your idols, with the

532
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
available, with the ability to, uh, guarantee your one LP slams, with the ability to switch

533
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
out your attributes and all these new items and gear, uh, champion affixes, uh, what are

534
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the thoughts around power creep and trying to keep that under control?

535
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah, it's, it's an important topic.

536
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Um, so we incrementally buff monsters almost every patch because we don't want the player

537
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
power to start to drastically outpace monster power.

538
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
When we elevate the player power floor with additions, like you're calling out right now,

539
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
um, that prevents us from having to do things like introduce a patch where we buff monsters

540
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
very significantly, which can feel very jarring to players.

541
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Uh, so just as we continue to elevate the floor of player power, we will incrementally buff,

542
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
uh, monsters with, with these outgoing patches.

543
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay.

544
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Nice.

545
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So, I mean, speaking of play player power with the massive amount of changes, pretty much

546
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
every ability has in the game, there's going to be some builds that just explode with damage

547
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and you might not even foresee this.

548
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Is there any plans on maybe reining those in?

549
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
If you see certain builds, just being ridiculously overpowered and maybe the same builds busted.

550
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah.

551
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
How are you going to handle that?

552
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Is that something where it's like time to nerf it to the ground or maybe nerf it a little bit?

553
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
What's your theory on that?

554
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Uh, we just don't do mid-season balance changes.

555
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's just extremely disheartening and disruptive to pull the mat from underneath your, you know,

556
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
you're playing a good build and there's no bugs or anything involved.

557
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And then suddenly your build is gone.

558
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's just, it's just horrible feeling.

559
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And when we pulled the community on this topic, it was pretty obvious that unless bugs are causing it, just keep it intact.

560
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And it's aligned pretty well with our internal thoughts on the, on the matters.

561
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And now we do, we do address any bugs that present outlier cases like this.

562
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And so it might be that something has broken and then, you know, you're scaling way higher than intended because of that.

563
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
We do fix issues in that regard.

564
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Another thing that will, um, allow this to feel better is that we need to start releasing seasons more rapidly than the release between 1.1 and 1.2.

565
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So if there is something that's very overpowered and we would want to have the opportunity to balance that, uh, sooner than having a patch release, you know, in the, in the same time span as, uh, 1, 1 to 1, 2.

566
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay.

567
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah.

568
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That's the TLDR.

569
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Uh, no balance changes, but bug fixes.

570
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yes.

571
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Got it.

572
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
If it's bugged, you'll patch it.

573
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
If it's just broken from over tuning, it stays until the next season.

574
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Okay.

575
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Uh, Judd, I'm glad you brought that up.

576
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Cause that was going to be my next question.

577
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You said something where everybody was like, Oh yeah, we'll believe it when we see it.

578
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So I just thought we could bring it up now on the first, uh, uh, tour of the original.

579
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Uh, tour of the erase podcast.

580
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You said something with racks and Zizarin that the goal for time in between seasons is actually three months.

581
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And then if it goes to, I think that's an, or if it goes to three and a half, so be it, if it goes to four months, so be it.

582
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But really the goal in between patches is three to four months.

583
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yeah.

584
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
We think the most healthy cadence for releasing content for last epoch in the future will be at a three month cadence.

585
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It is something that again, we are getting our legs when it comes to games as a service and the live operations model.

586
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Uh, we are doing way better than we ever have about making content in parallel.

587
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So there are many things that we have in development for future season releases already.

588
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Uh, so we're making really good progress to what we need to do to make that happen.

589
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Uh, so the, the ultimate goal will be three month seasonal releases.

590
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I think it's more appropriate to say four months is something that we feel like is reasonable for 11th hour games at the moment, but certainly not this, uh, large gap that we've had between 1.1 and 1.2.

591
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
We, the, the, the gap between 1.1 and 1.2 was really based on player feedback and people telling us that they really wanted to see additional in game, these quality of life improvements.

592
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And so we had an internal debate about what we were going to do because we even had a roadmap posted, uh, with content that we were coming out with for 1.2.

593
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And with all the feedback that we were ingesting, we were like, you know, it's going to make us feel like we are just blind to the feedback that we're receiving.

594
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
If we create the content that was positioned to come in the previous version of 1.2.

595
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So we decided it was time for us to, you know, go heads down, listen to the players, focus on the stuff that you guys want.

596
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And that is the result of, uh, what we have coming in season two.

597
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It did take a little bit longer to come out, but we do think that people are really going to enjoy, uh, the efforts and the content going in.

598
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So we're going to be able to do that.

599
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So we're going to be able to do that.

600
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Awesome.

601
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Awesome.

602
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Awesome.

603
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'm excited for season two.

604
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And obviously I'm excited for season three.

605
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Cause Mike has talked about some Necro stuff.

606
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So, you know, I just, uh, anyways, what do you got frosty?

607
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So I was looking at the video you released earlier and that they talked about the gauntlet of strife woven echo, which is basically you're fighting a gauntlet of bosses.

608
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Roughly how many bosses are we fighting in a row here?

609
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Is it like two or is it like 10?

610
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What, what's, what is it?

611
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I think it's two.

612
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Okay.

613
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah.

614
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Holly.

615
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Holly.

616
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Holly.

617
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah.

618
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It's more, it's more, it's, it's more than two.

619
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And there's chat, there's champions in there too.

620
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I think it's, it's seven.

621
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's seven.

622
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah.

623
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

624
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That feels like a gauntlet.

625
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And it's not, it's not just bosses, but the bosses have their little, little champions with them.

626
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Okay.

627
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
They have their minions as well.

628
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Well, I'm looking forward to that.

629
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
There's like a champion that's like paired with each boss.

630
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh, nice.

631
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Nice.

632
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Okay.

633
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So we got mastery respect.

634
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
That was something that EHG was flexible on in the past.

635
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's like, no, no, no, right now we don't want to do it.

636
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
They brought that in.

637
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
We were subbing there for a while.

638
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yep.

639
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Something else that has been added to the game is we've always been able to jump through the

640
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
dungeons to kind of jump through the campaign on alt characters, but something that was always

641
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
kind of a pain point is you didn't get your idols and you didn't get your passive points,

642
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
which means you still had to just run this quest anyways.

643
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So most people didn't use that feature.

644
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Now with season two, you could be able to jump through the dungeons and you can get some

645
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
of your passive points and some of your idols.

646
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I thought somebody from EHG could talk through the thought process on this and why the decision

647
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
was made.

648
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yeah.

649
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You know, so the dungeon keys were added as a campaign skip for alt characters.

650
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
This is something we don't want the keys to drop earlier than where they're dropping right

651
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
now for your first campaign playthrough, because for new players, this could result in a

652
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
lot of confusion.

653
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
They could go and complete the dungeon and then they're spit out the other side at a

654
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
much higher zone level.

655
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And for a new player that doesn't understand that, you know, that can be frustrating or they

656
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
just don't think that they've done the right thing.

657
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And so we intend this to be a campaign skip for alt characters.

658
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,000
One thing that we have discussed internally that we may do is we might actually have dungeon

659
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
keys hidden in places where our veteran players can know to go and pick them up so they can

660
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
actually go if they feel like they have the skill level to go and just out skill the over

661
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
leveled content for them.

662
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Hold on a second.

663
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We might be talking about the current hidden zones that are already in the game.

664
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You're going to hide keys in there.

665
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Is that the idea?

666
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That's an idea.

667
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That's certainly something that we could do is hide them in areas like that.

668
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Like, or it could just be a barrel really far off the beaten path that probably people

669
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
aren't going to go to.

670
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yeah, we, we, it's one of those things in discussion though.

671
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Um, we understand that there are a lot of people that would like to progress through

672
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the campaign more quickly.

673
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Uh, we've added that via dungeon skips, uh, but we don't want to mess up the new player

674
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
experience for the people who are actually new to the game and going through the campaign

675
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
or going through the dungeons and being spit out at a, uh, higher level zone could be a

676
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
really bad experience for brand new players.

677
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And in terms of, in terms of hiding the keys, it's, it's more like the cave in the starting

678
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
zone, uh, with the veteran boots are like that sort of stuff.

679
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah.

680
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah.

681
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's probably going to be like one shot cash.

682
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So you don't like repeatedly farm the key there.

683
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
The character has a chance, one, one chance with the key at the beginning, if you want

684
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
to go risk it.

685
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Okay.

686
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's also, if you've never done one of the dungeons before, some of them are pretty

687
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
tough to get through on your very first shot blind.

688
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So if you find, if you do find a key and you go down that extra side path on your very

689
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
first character, never even played the game before you stumble into the dungeon by

690
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
mistake.

691
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And you're, you, you just get booped by something and you're, that was your one shot.

692
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Cause you don't have any second keys and you had no idea what to expect and you can't learn

693
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
it.

694
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And then you're like, Oh, like I'm stuck.

695
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
And you have to figure out where that branch point was and go backtracking it.

696
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And it's yeah.

697
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That's a, that's a good time to plug the, uh, respawn system actually.

698
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah.

699
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So with the launch of season two, uh, you can use an additional key to respawn at the floor

700
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
that you're on at the dungeon or at the boss, uh, which, you know, I think people are really

701
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
going to, really going to enjoy.

702
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Uh, we also, this isn't coming with season two, but we have a large amount of effort underway

703
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
for, uh, tutorializing some things better, like crafting for new players or like, uh, going

704
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
into the temporal sanctum and using, uh, those abilities and knowing when to do that.

705
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
We have some updates coming there that just like for, for new players, it'll make the

706
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
experience, um, uh, just, just easier to understand overall.

707
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah.

708
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I love hearing that.

709
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yeah.

710
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm a more casual player for sure.

711
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And I, I'm also a bow player, so I die often and being able to just get to the end of a dungeon.

712
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
If I die and being able to come back and not have to redo the whole thing, I'm a huge fan

713
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
of that.

714
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Look, like I, I might have a little trouble reading every single thing when it comes to

715
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the crafting.

716
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So having some kind of tutorial, uh, maybe would help out my learning style a bit more

717
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
for sure.

718
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So I'm also a big fan of that.

719
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Frosty.

720
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's not just you.

721
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Uh, we cannot get people to read, uh, even internally.

722
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
We don't do it either.

723
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So like we really have to, we really have to point at things with arrows.

724
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
If we want you to see it, we got to make it flash really brightly.

725
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
We got to put a big arrow next to it.

726
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And we understand that.

727
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And it's something that it's easier to go and write a wall of text for tutorial.

728
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Um, but now that we actually have some additional time and development power, we can go through

729
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
and make those tutorials just significantly better than we had, uh, in the past.

730
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So a lot, a lot of work, uh, going on in that area right now.

731
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Yeah.

732
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
We're, we're, we're looking at a contextual toast notifications for game guide as well.

733
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You know, when something specific happens, a small popup notification, like you to the game

734
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
page is a good resource and we don't do the best job at signposting that or pointing you to it.

735
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Um, beyond small buttons and things like that.

736
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Everyone in chat saying we don't read.

737
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So yeah, we need those types of indicators.

738
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
We don't either guys.

739
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Um, I guess a random, I guess, side note question here.

740
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So circle of fortune and merchant's guild, are you guys still doing balance adjustments?

741
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And have you noticed maybe players veering more towards one or the other at the moment?

742
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:46,000
In terms of, in terms of balance adjustments, uh, the, the focus on this season, you know,

743
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
we, we had to spend time adding the new end game faction.

744
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Um, there are some, there are some small adjustments we've made there.

745
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Um, but we, you know, we, we, we, we are aware of, uh, the need to improve, uh, some UX

746
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and UX in the bazaar and, uh, certainly some quality of life elsewhere.

747
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Um, so it, it, it hasn't been a goal this patch, uh, to, uh, you know, to update and balance factions.

748
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Uh, but there are some, there are some small changes we've made that should hopefully help.

749
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah.

750
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
As far as like the split that we see going COF versus merchant's guild, uh, typically at the start of the seasons,

751
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
we see people going COF, uh, in large quantities.

752
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And then as the season progresses, we do see, uh, an amount of players swapping over to merchant's guild.

753
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Uh, but the, the split there does seem to reliably be healthy.

754
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,000
People are, people seem to be choosing the item faction that allows them to get items in the way that they would like to achieve items.

755
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So I, I think that system is actually working very well right now.

756
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Uh, certainly always room for improvements there and, and slight balance adjustments, but yeah, overall, we're very happy with it.

757
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Okay.

758
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Thanks.

759
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Gambler's fallacy is back.

760
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
What prompted the reversion, uh, to reverse it and to bring it back?

761
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Um, also for the people don't know, what is it?

762
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Uh, it's an AMOLED that makes you always crit.

763
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
If you haven't crit recently, I think.

764
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Uh, it's, it's a, it was a very powerful leveling unique for certain skills that had like high mana costs and whatnot.

765
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And you just like, like, like laser, for example, you just use it every now and then it just destroyed the screen with that.

766
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Uh, and the, the reason why it was removed was because there was a bug that allow you to just get multiple copies of it without ever completing the quest.

767
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So you could just get a lot of gold.

768
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Uh, and it wasn't a very big prior to get like get it back immediately because there's the, uh, soulfire bastion, uh, dungeon that had a better version of that, that you can farm for LP.

769
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
But we, we, uh, we found a, found some time to sneak that back in.

770
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So, yeah.

771
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Nice.

772
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So with the massive game pad targeting improvements, is this a good indicator that maybe one day soon we'll be seeing last epoch for console?

773
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Hmm.

774
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Um, we would love to get to console and we are doing everything that would allow game pad to be.

775
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
To be of the quality that would, uh, mean that people would like to see it on console.

776
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Uh, we don't have anything there to announce at the moment, but we certainly do want to make sure that when you are playing on the PC.

777
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
No matter what your preferred input method is, the game is a phenomenal experience.

778
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And so this now includes W A S C D.

779
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Uh, but key, you know, keyboard, mouse, uh, game pad targeting a lot of, a lot of really good adjustments going in here.

780
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And, uh, future efforts for game pad.

781
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I mean, a lot of stuff underway here.

782
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Um, we have the targeting feeling pretty darn good right now.

783
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Uh, the UI has been improved significantly already for game pad, but we have a lot of work going for UI, mainly navigation happening for game pad in the future.

784
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Because we do want game pad, we want the game pad experience to feel native.

785
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
If you swap over to a game pad, it should feel like it was built natively for the game pad.

786
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So, uh, a lot of good adjustments there coming up.

787
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Uh, it's some of our very favorite stuff to work on both Ross and I have a UI background.

788
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:37,000
So it's our time to just kind of hang out, geek out, uh, work on some UI stuff, but, uh, yeah, a lot, a lot of good game pad improvements coming console, nothing to announce, uh, but certainly, you know, working our way in that vein.

789
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
But you guys want to in the future have last epoch on console.

790
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That's a future goal.

791
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah, we would love to do.

792
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Okay.

793
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah.

794
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Okay.

795
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Awesome.

796
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Uh, I get this question all the time.

797
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Why is it the Weaver tree and not the Weaver web?

798
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I know.

799
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And what is the super beacon?

800
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Uh, you know, uh, the, the name originally was Weaver's web.

801
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Um, there's a, there's a, there's a lot of debate internally about this because I think I thought, you know, we, we, we thought people would default to calling it the Weaver tree enemy.

802
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And we call other trees, skill trees and things like that.

803
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's not a, it, you know, it's not a type of naming that is, uh, it's consistent with the rest of the trees in the game.

804
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But yes, there was, it was a divisive decision.

805
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Let's put it that way.

806
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Um, got it, uh, in terms of super beacons.

807
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Um, those are just bigger beacons.

808
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Like you have in the monolith, they reveal a large area on the echo web.

809
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Um, and that just allows you to plan things out a bit more.

810
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Like if you've got imprinted woven echoes, that's a good way to search for those passively spawning.

811
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Okay.

812
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So I think I see there's something called a shade ambush being added to the game.

813
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Uh, what is this?

814
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Is it scary?

815
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Um, do they drop anything?

816
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Just try to explain this to me a bit more.

817
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Okay.

818
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Do you want to talk to that one?

819
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Uh, I mean, it's like a normal shade fight.

820
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It just pops in, in your echo and drops you loot if you can kill it.

821
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It's the same ambush as we already have in other like ambush echoes already.

822
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So you'll like the, the mechanics for the ambush part of it happen the same as normal.

823
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And then it's the shade of Orbis fight, just like you'd fight it normally.

824
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So it is like, it's, it's two things that we kind of already have and just.

825
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:39,000
However, it is not, it's a good, however, it is not the, the actual, like it doesn't add shade into the normal ambushes that you get as objectives.

826
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It's just like an additional that happens randomly.

827
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Okay.

828
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Okay.

829
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I think I got, I got one more question, Aaron, before we go to the next screen, but.

830
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay.

831
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Go ahead.

832
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Shoot.

833
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I think it's like Uber Avaroth being brought to the game.

834
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So this Avaroth is like, how much more powerful than the one we've already fought?

835
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's a good question.

836
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yes.

837
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Oh, and also it doesn't have new abilities.

838
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Another good question.

839
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yes.

840
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Kind of.

841
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yes.

842
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It's, it's, it's a lot harder.

843
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's a lot harder.

844
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Could I have harder?

845
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yes.

846
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm, I'm, I'm ready to see the, the, the, the rip clips.

847
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I'm, I'm so ready.

848
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'm so ready.

849
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
And I'm so ready to decide to myself as well.

850
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah.

851
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It does have a bit of corruption.

852
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
What percentage of players do you think could beat it?

853
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Not, not very high.

854
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yeah.

855
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
No, not very many.

856
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
One.

857
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Not very many.

858
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah.

859
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Like if a thousand people beat regular Avaroth, how many of those thousand would be able to

860
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
beat Uber Avaroth?

861
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
How much time do they have?

862
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I would, I would probably go with a single digit.

863
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Wow.

864
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But it's a lot harder.

865
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Aspirational content.

866
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
It is a very hard fight.

867
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Yes.

868
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Do you not expect most people to be able to do it?

869
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Did Karp just say maybe nine people?

870
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Nine?

871
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Single digit?

872
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Damn.

873
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Yeah.

874
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Of the thousand.

875
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Of the thousand.

876
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yes.

877
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Not total.

878
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah.

879
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Okay.

880
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That's like 1% of players that can kill Avaroth now will be able to kill Uber Avaroth.

881
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
That, that's, that is what I am thinking.

882
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Thinking.

883
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
We had some technical difficulties at the beginning of the stream.

884
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Don't worry.

885
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I'm not terrified to go to the next scene.

886
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I'm sure it'll work fine.

887
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Please work fine.

888
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Please work fine.

889
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Moving on to our second scene for the town portal podcast.

890
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Oh God, everything.

891
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Oh, that's fine.

892
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Okay.

893
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Aaron, Aaron, are you still there?

894
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Can you guys, can you guys hear Aaron?

895
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I hear Aaron.

896
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Oh no.

897
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Where'd he go?

898
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It is.

899
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
It is.

900
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
We can hear you.

901
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It's fine.

902
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
You're good.

903
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It's fine.

904
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It's fine.

905
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It's fine.

906
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Yeah.

907
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Me.

908
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You, I was like.

909
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Thank you.

910
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I appreciate you.

911
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
for good to see.

912
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
You, I was a player of the panel that said,

913
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I need it.

914
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah.

915
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
that do it to me.

916
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
no, but at the end.

917
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Eh, we were always on my head because I days were at...!

918
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
No.

919
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
You WIITNX 뒹rlyMVIHII99...

920
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Wait.

921
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
wait.

922
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Wait, really?

923
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Hello, hello.

924
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Hello.

925
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Hello, hello.

926
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Hello, hello.

927
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Hello.

928
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
We can hear Aaron just fine in the call.

929
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
the call looks like ehg team can hear aaron but no one else can hello hello that's our team

930
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:42,000
i thought you guys were playing a prank on me i'm like oh very funny yeah yeah yeah you were

931
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
initially a joke at the start i know ehg if you guys didn't hear was gracious enough to give me

932
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,000
27 clips to show off on this extra screen and we're gonna go through these right now

933
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
if anybody wants to pause and comment go ahead so we're gonna look at some uh skill

934
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
we're gonna start off with some uh mtx's chthonic fisher

935
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:16,000
and with these you guys can notice some of our environment and lighting improvements as well

936
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:28,000
i love these so much just the variations that come in chthonic fisher is already so cool looking

937
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:37,000
that it's like you know it's like double moving on okay i feel like people are gonna be like no way

938
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
are you guys ready for this i think this is my favorite one

939
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:58,000
anybody a fan of hammers it's so good it looks so good

940
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:05,000
yes we're so excited that we can do these now this is something we're wanting to do for a very

941
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
long time and we just didn't have the tech to do skill skins very i'm pretty sure we just

942
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,000
said build for so many people i know they're so cool we were talking about it like should we

943
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:25,000
should we base our build based upon the skill mtx i know all right moving on and a couple of these

944
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
are smaller they're not all exciting like hammers cherry blossom evade

945
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:40,000
the little evade effects i think are uh some of my favorites actually just like the subtle little

946
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
touches oh it was worth noting on evade uh this season uh it's a lot more responsive a bunch of

947
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:55,000
offline bugs with our fixed uh it's just better okay moving on cosmic

948
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,000
smite and just so you're aware maybe i've tested this that if you're using a you could use a skill

949
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
mtx and to trigger another skill and use that mtx so these can all be combined

950
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:18,000
yeah i do love having the like the visual connection between skills in the in the cosmetics as well

951
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:25,000
if we don't happen to have a cliff of triggering smite with hammer throw any chance that would be so

952
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
nice i know we don't have that

953
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:36,000
i'll have to use your imagination for now then i guess right moving on yeah your your mtx also applies

954
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
to uh skill shrines as well just a just a small thing but it also applies to any skill that you

955
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
gain from skill shrines oh that's pretty cool that is pretty cool you can equip lots of skill mtx all at

956
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
the same time not just one for each slot that you have equipped either sorry everybody i know sometimes

957
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
the volume is high sometimes it's low each clip is a is a different volume all right moving on

958
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
uh volatile reversal cosmic

959
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
nice

960
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
whoa

961
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:19,000
it's pretty cool pretty neat and we continue

962
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:29,000
okay guys this is dragon claw rive i've been playing so much primalist i swear i see swipe when

963
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
i look at this tell tell me unless i'm losing my mind which i probably am

964
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:44,000
i can see it you can see it yeah yeah i can see it yeah for the first two swings yeah yeah

965
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
this is rive dragon claw rive

966
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,000
okay

967
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
uh itera's messenger wings backslot

968
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
these ones don't have any audio you guys probably don't know this i'm not a wings guy

969
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
i never wear wings so the chat always gives me crap when they see wings

970
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:22,000
okay there's some sort of bet that you can lose to us and uh force you to wear wings they always do

971
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:30,000
that i'm a wings man now chat's going crazy moving on okay this is actually in my opinion carve the best

972
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
one when you it's automatically triggering smite the uh warpath holy warpath

973
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
you hunt it down if you use this while playing white knight

974
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
don't buy it don't do it right

975
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:05,000
against the tos okay warpath spin to win moving on login screen so mtx um historically if you look at

976
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
uh season zero season one your mtx was not actually shown on your login screen now it is

977
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:18,000
that's it i think you're going to be able to see the uh

978
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:28,000
um i'm like i don't typically get mtx but ability mtx i'm super into so is this something that you will

979
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,000
plan to have on possibly every ability one day and even going further will it be multiple for each

980
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
ability one day yeah i think um it's a very high likelihood that we get all abilities and and then

981
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
multiple per abilities uh it's one of these things that we are really excited about internally

982
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
um you know we're constantly getting into calls and geeking out about just things that we can do now

983
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:57,000
that we have this tech uh some of the ones that i'm most excited about are like the uh minion skill

984
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:03,000
reskins but of course those are the uh hardest to or are the most resource intensive to actually create

985
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
and implement but you know i i want i want a phoenix flying around that's a falcon or uh you know i

986
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,000
want like uh there's just so many cool things that we could do uh with the minion reskinning and on our

987
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
last our last podcast people were uh you know they want to see the capybara and one of these slots as

988
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:29,000
well uh yeah yeah definitely we will be implementing a lot more skill mtx uh if you guys have any ideas for

989
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
those that you would like to see we're pretty easy to convince right now um so if

990
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
you guys have any ideas or suggestions feel free to go to our discord or our reddit or uh our forums

991
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and make those suggestions and it's yeah it's just something that we're looking to figure out what

992
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
the catalog is going to look like long term we'll be adding a lot more okay yeah i think the the the

993
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
goal is definitely to uh you know pick a pick a theme and have enough with the skills you're using to

994
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
put together a nice theme like if you're essentially using warp path like uh you should be able to put

995
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
together a sort of teal theme like a death knight theme like that you know that that sort of stuff

996
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
um we're also uh adding uh you know for the different colors that we have here um we're adding

997
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
different hit flash and death vfx for as well so that if you have red lightning blast you don't have

998
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
the blue hit flash and things like that so we've added a lot of that this season as well

999
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
so i have to i figure this you guys knew this question was going to come it's i could see it

1000
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:30,000
going in the chat over and over again people want to spend money that only play offline is there any

1001
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,000
plans to bring cosmetics to the offline crew yeah it's something we know people want we'll do it nice

1002
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
consider it written consider it done moving on

1003
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,000
new lightning blast yeah and just to reiterate like raw said earlier we now have lightning blast

1004
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
where it actually chains and it feels it feels so much better uh this is it's it's just a little

1005
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
recolor here but it feels really cool again yes it's some skills um some skills work well with just a

1006
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
very basic recolor you know with with some skill effects here we've created a theme for it and

1007
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
it's like something new and with others simple recolors are actually you know quite effective

1008
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
and this is an example of that people say this is how you become a sith lord right yes yes right and

1009
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
we also do have you mentioned earlier about some skills getting multiple conversions we do have some

1010
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
already that'll have multiple conversions like there's multiple lightning glass conversions i think

1011
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,000
okay

1012
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:41,000
okay somebody in chat literally a few seconds ago said hey can we get a reskin for wolves

1013
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
they must have heard you yep this is unbelievable unbelievable what happens if i take squirrels no

1014
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
just uh somebody what does happen i think if you take squirrels it does go to squirrels no no it

1015
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
always goes it goes it goes it goes to mtx is that right okay so the squirrels will show up as

1016
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
smaller dogs is that right guys is that true i don't i don't i don't think they're small dogs no

1017
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:16,000
uh oh my gosh i will switch my starting build if i get these as squirrels i'm gonna ask the team

1018
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
right now they'll just try like a squirrels themed like this that doesn't happen

1019
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:32,000
but we did talk about this uh recently so this is a pestilent hound summon wolf skill mtx now people

1020
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,000
are saying hell squirrels hey by the way since we're speaking of squirrels when are we going to get that

1021
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
uh void conversion for squirrels that we get out of the shrine you guys must get that question all the

1022
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:54,000
time too that's fine like the primalists theming itself doesn't lend itself well to a actual void

1023
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
powered skill there's not enough there's not enough support in the primalist tree to to actually give

1024
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:07,000
a void skill to primalist right now um that's fair we'll just do void bees then all right moving on

1025
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:15,000
this is the hatchery portal hatchery portal

1026
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
this one's my favorites you like this one yeah

1027
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
okay we need uh we need a leroy situation we need to use that egg and that dragon to like run through

1028
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
and break them that's exactly what it should be yeah that was that was whatever wolveneckle uh

1029
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
plans that didn't quite get across the lane unfortunately oh geez rainbow evade

1030
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:00,000
is there a chest at the end of the evade yeah right shattered frost claw shattered frost claw

1031
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:08,000
the shattered ones are so good oh yeah you like this one one people are gonna there's a few themes

1032
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:15,000
like this and they're all really good i like the sound too it's good

1033
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,000

1034
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
shattered meteor judd's favorite

1035
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
cool

1036
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:40,000
meteor's another one that's got multiple uh multiple mtx options for it it was hilarious when mike said on

1037
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
a friday dev stream that skill mtx is coming we all knew that there was at least one meteor we knew it

1038
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:53,000
like oh yeah of course of course if i could have pushed six through uh correct correct it's the only

1039
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:00,000
guarantee it was the only guarantee if you guys don't know it top dog at ehg judd uh his favorite

1040
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
skill is meteor okay always has been

1041
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
this is the slack hopper pet and i'm hoping one of you could tell me what's flying in and out of its shell

1042
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
oh

1043
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
those are little frogs with wings i was like

1044
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
is that what it is it's a frog yeah yeah yeah they live inside that shell they're uh

1045
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:34,000
a mutually beneficial relationship how nice there's lore behind it oh symbiote oh it's a it's a it's a frog

1046
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
fairy there you go i can't get over how that eyes pop out

1047
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
i didn't even notice the eyes popping out hold on a second

1048
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:59,000
oh yeah they do pop out it's like a turtle head all right now we are moving over to um twitch drops and

1049
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:06,000
there's a couple other there's a couple other ones in here so come april 17th your favorite creator

1050
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:14,000
if you um gift a sub or do one tier one sub i don't know if prime sub works guys uh this is the

1051
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
support a creator unique it is the corrupted maelstrom

1052
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
i don't think crime subs work okay

1053
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,000
yeah

1054
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
crimes don't work all right so tier one or one gifted you can get corrupted maelstrom

1055
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:48,000
all right next this is a uh free twitch drop i don't i know total twitch drops is six hours

1056
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,000
i don't remember which one unlocks where but this is the uh twitch drop for crimson smite

1057
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:05,000
that's cool it's so cool i know i like this one a lot i love that you guys did a couple for smite

1058
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
too because it's just like a skill that's used so like everybody uses smite right smart

1059
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:19,000
all right holy shuriken

1060
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:30,000
again everything twitch because like it's so hard to see uh the base shurikens and this one if you if

1061
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,000
you want to see exactly where they're going this one's so visible um some people don't want to see

1062
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
where they're going either but yeah if you do really want to see where they're going so you're

1063
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
saying this is pay to win right here if you want to see where they're going this is the pay to win

1064
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
mtx i mean if you could control where they were going sure but they have a mind of their own

1065
01:06:47,000 --> 01:07:03,000
next rip blood there's one of these at order i'll show at the end rip blood twitch drop

1066
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
uh holy lightning blast twitch drop

1067
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
i think i just really like the lightning moves lightnings lightnings always look good

1068
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
also see the new chaining here oh you can see the new chaining and i'll let this one play for a sec

1069
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
that's a small delay it feels so much better now

1070
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
like very tiny chance i didn't change it just feels so much better because it used to be that you'd cast

1071
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:52,000
and it just kind of create a web um that little tactical feel just goes okay i think the last one

1072
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
which is not a twitch drop yes void walker's gaze helmet

1073
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
oh wow

1074
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:17,000
some sparkly eyes that one's too scary too scary all right now ehg sent me i believe an additional five

1075
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
clips that i don't have queued up like this they came in late but that's okay

1076
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
so the first one i want to show and i can we can finally confirm

1077
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
uh judd's very happy

1078
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
do it meteor meteor

1079
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
around meteor the beauty what the beat here

1080
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:48,000
those are bees those they are it's like it's like a big comb it's like a big hive that comes down

1081
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and splashes honey so your meteor turns in yes exactly the b tier

1082
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
now that's an mtx

1083
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,000
i like this it's like this one's really good just the way it looks that is that is awesome hey it's

1084
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
cool mike i don't know if you know this what if you take like um oh my look at that pause right there

1085
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
oh that looks so good what happens if you take like meteorites does it transfer the meteorites

1086
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,000
too into small yeah i'm pretty sure there's a risk of the little of the the spawn sub skills

1087
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
so all of the skill mtx it doesn't matter where you go on the tree you're still going to be able

1088
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
to see the visual it should it should all work yeah

1089
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
if we miss something that's got to be fixed no no i got you okay just that just popped in my

1090
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
head because i was thinking about like if you're dropping a hundred of these all the time like

1091
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:51,000
that would be very very cool it's also a big reason why it takes so long to bake mtx for our

1092
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,000
skills because we have so many different ways to modify them and then we get to like figure out

1093
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:05,000
how the mtx is going to look on those as well okay all right the uh bee meteor is real okay the

1094
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
other things that were sent to me is we have some examples of the new controller support

1095
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
and the new wasd movement all right controller support and the new wasd movement and some of

1096
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,000
this stuff real quick go ahead and right before you start um i don't know if i dreamt this but is there a

1097
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:29,000
is there a heart seeker cosmetic also correct yes sorry okay great great all right that's just

1098
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
how to make sure because i remember seeing it and being like oh i want that and just wanted to make

1099
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
sure that that definitely is in the game because again i like bow stuff and glad to know there's a

1100
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:45,000
heart seeker cosmetic all right yes it's like this blue like this blue chain i don't know how to

1101
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
describe it it's like a it looks like a blue chain like you're you're playing scorpion get over here

1102
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,000
it's kind of what it looks it's really cool looking nice all right everybody this clip was sent to me it

1103
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,000
it is 20 seconds i haven't even watched it this is experimental w a s d i don't even know if there's

1104
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:11,000
audio let's see yeah this is showing how you actually get to the options to change the controls

1105
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
very long and involved process

1106
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:22,000
yes yes they're reading involved yeah and i just see the photonic captured warpath uh and this does

1107
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
actually have options so you can in the settings you can change if the warpath is going to follow

1108
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,000
your cursor when you're using w a s d or actually just following your input uh that was kind of a

1109
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,000
divisive league internally how we should do it and people had very specific preferences there and so we

1110
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:46,000
made that an option so and just remember everybody that e h g um this putting this in as beta so this

1111
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:52,000
is for people that really love w a s d is going to have that option and in the future it'll continuously

1112
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:59,000
get better nice yeah yeah we heard from the player base uh you know those that have tried out w a s d on

1113
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
uh other other games really enjoy that and they're like i don't know if i'll ever be able to go back

1114
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
to not having wasdy as the main control schema and we're like okay let's see let's see how hard this

1115
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
would be to prototype and get in and with a quick prototype we we pretty quickly understood that it

1116
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:19,000
already felt pretty good and so we invested the additional time uh in in season two to get the

1117
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
control schemas and stuff like that set up so yeah uh yeah we're excited to hear people's feedback on

1118
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
this um we'll be looking for it sweet

1119
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
okay the next clip is what is this

1120
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:44,000
puncture before and after puncture before and after this is this is gamepad targeting this is

1121
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
the first time i've seen this video too but this is i believe what is on the left is probably what's

1122
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
on live versus what exists in season two yeah okay let's watch the video here we go

1123
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:03,000
yeah so what we've done here is we've actually adds added some target memory uh so so previously

1124
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
on the gamepad it would be that if you start to hit an enemy say that you uh shoot an arrow towards an

1125
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
enemy and then you have to start kiting that enemy you'd have to flick the joystick back and forth to

1126
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
shoot in that direction and then start cutting again turn back in that direction now if there is

1127
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,000
not a new target recognized in the direction that you are running uh shooting that arrow will instead

1128
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
just turn around very quickly and shoot uh without you having to do it manually it helps the flow of

1129
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:36,000
gamepad uh combat just very this i mean this is huge this is like this is completely changing the

1130
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:45,000
entire gameplay feel for somebody using a controller like that's yeah yeah it helps it helps an absolute

1131
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
ton it helps an absolute ton wow and there's there's all sorts of settings for different contexts and

1132
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
specializations for like every combination of all those things and because there's so many

1133
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
situations you can be in in so many combinations it is something that we're going to be looking at

1134
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,000
feedback for very closely to yeah to get outlying and special case where people are like when i've

1135
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
taken these six nodes together and i'm in this very specific scenario of combat it does something

1136
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,000
weird and we're like cool no one thought mike's mike's referring to the uh skill targeting updates that

1137
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
we've made uh so we put a the team put a lot of work into this we've essentially made all these different

1138
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:28,000
paradigms for how skills can or should act in combat uh and we've mapped all of the skills and all of the

1139
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:35,000
nodes that may be or should change the way that targeting functions with the gamepad um and so now

1140
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:43,000
i mean the the update makes gamepad play it's just i can't even emphasize how much better it is with

1141
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,000
these changes um it what it also allows us to do is to make changes to those paradigms that we're mapping

1142
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,000
to these skills uh very quickly it's very standardized um so if there is an instance where people feel like

1143
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,000
one of these abilities could be controlled better or differently that would make it feel better we can get

1144
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
that feedback and we can make that change much much more rapidly than we did before uh so yeah

1145
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,000
these are phenomenal gamepad improvements man and i thought gamepad was already good like i always

1146
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,000
thought you guys it's it's it's getting there it's getting there for sure uh people people are already

1147
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
enjoying it but you know uh we we still see a lot of opportunity to improve that we really want

1148
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:30,000
when you swap to gamepad for it to feel natively like it was made for the gamepad uh we're making

1149
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,000
really good progress there it's feeling pretty good at the moment but still more more to do more to do

1150
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,000
now judd if i'm using my controller playing on gamepad and then i set down my controller and i grab my

1151
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:50,000
keyboard and mouse will it work seamlessly yeah uh so you can hot swap between gamepad and keyboard and

1152
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:58,000
mouse pretty nice oh cool cool okay very nice what i just i wasn't sure so i just asked a simple

1153
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:07,000
question all right all right and i will say this is a huge dps increase this change too if if you're not

1154
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:14,000
someone who is going to manually twitch super fast to go and do these same types of actions it is it is a

1155
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:22,000
dps improvement yes okay ballista armed construction again i have not seen this if one of you guys want

1156
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:30,000
to uh this is just the ballista targeting uh based on context so it's it knows that it wants to

1157
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:36,000
near enemies because it's going to explode when it dies okay so normally if you just summoned ballista

1158
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,000
it would summon next to you but in this case since you've taken ballista in a certain way it it goes next

1159
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
to the enemy correct correct correct so it used to be that if you had a target focused uh in the

1160
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
live version of last epoch right now it would just summon the ballista at the target's location which

1161
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
would quickly end up in the enemies swarming it and dispatching it which is not a great way to play

1162
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000
ballista um now if you are targeting something it knows to put the ballista next to you or away from

1163
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
that group of enemies but if you take this node where you would typically want the ballista to be right

1164
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
in the middle of all the combat it knows to do that so it's just another example of uh

1165
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:20,000
the the different uh paradigms that we've executed on for these abilities okay and the last one

1166
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:30,000
this is ballista before and after okay there you go oh well i got it

1167
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:43,000
oh and this is when it's uh i see so on the left hand screen you are putting the ballista around all

1168
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
the enemies for it to die and on the right screen it's staying close to you so you're talking you're

1169
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:56,000
actually shooting it at range correct and it's it's every single ability in the game um so like these

1170
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,000
are these are just a couple examples but everything has been touched so if you if you have a certain

1171
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:07,000
build in mind and you're like oh these don't really apply to me they absolutely do something that um a

1172
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:14,000
skill that uh at least when i'm streaming last epoch people talk about a lot is using a controller and

1173
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
fury leap i i don't know if anybody has any experience with that but i think yes i don't i don't so uh

1174
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:26,000
what what what that does now is that if there is a recognized target it will fury leap you to the

1175
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,000
target and if not it'll take you as as far as the maximum allowed range will take you for that skill

1176
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:40,000
okay all right awesome well i've got a couple of other extra little things to show off here

1177
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:50,000
uh i know people have already seen a lot of them but i thought why not look at some unique items why

1178
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:56,000
not look at some unique items maybe not everybody has seen all of them yet so we pick some ones that

1179
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,000
haven't been released prior to the patch notes and i thought we could look at some of these together

1180
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:09,000
so the first one is downfall of the righteous now all these items that we're going to show right now are

1181
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:17,000
shown with their maximum rolls and you'll see the roll ranges and what this is is uh uh

1182
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
mike should i let you to i know you worked on this didn't you mike yeah i worked on this one yeah um

1183
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:31,000
yeah this is a this is a supporter unique actually um and so yeah it's really it's meant to get that like

1184
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:39,000
um that that curse play style scaling curse damage um it's focused around witch fire um you're

1185
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
you're you're like splitting usually fire and necrotic damage uh it's i think it's just really

1186
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:50,000
fun unique that kind of lets you sort of unlock new damage source in the in that tree for any warlock

1187
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,000
fans out there with this new relic you're gonna get in the implicit fire resistance and curse damage

1188
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:04,000
you're also gonna get up to 15 increased damage you're also gonna get leech from your damage over time

1189
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:11,000
necrotic and fire you're also gonna get more curse damage which filed which fire deals uh 66 wait

1190
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:18,000
deals multiplicative damage equal to 60 66 of your increased curse damage and again that's multiplicative

1191
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,000
but on top of that while you have both ignite overload and damned overload enemies within 10 meters

1192
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:32,000
are infected with witch fire every second this item is sick this we were reading through the patch notes and

1193
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
talking talking about some changes to warlock and i'm like guys there's something coming there's

1194
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:46,000
something really really nice uh new witch fire we are powerful yeah we are last last minute we are

1195
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
adding a visual effect so that they you know the 10 meter area is actually shown here that that helps

1196
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
with the feel of it a lot because uh without that it doesn't feel as satisfying wait a second so when i put

1197
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:03,000
on downfall of the righteous on my warlock there is going to be a ring around me that shows how many

1198
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
where the enemies will get witch fired correct

1199
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:16,000
one of the many skills that have a ring dealing damage for the time to enemies that go into it yes

1200
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:26,000
wow okay uh that is very very cool brilliant people are saying chat all right moving on to

1201
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:35,000
an acolyte relic this is unearthed memories wandering spirits is centered on a gravestone at the

1202
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:41,000
target location instead of you the gravestone grants allies within 12 meters 15 multiplicative

1203
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:49,000
necrotic damage over time against cursed enemies increased reveal rate for wandering spirits 12 to

1204
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
intelligence what is a gravestone does anybody

1205
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
you know like like you go to a graveyard and there's like the lots of the

1206
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:04,000
i know what a gravestone oh yeah like that i mean like what does this actually pull up a gravestone

1207
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
like does it is there a new visual in the game for it

1208
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,000
yeah

1209
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:17,000
there's so many new uniques it's impossible to target them all it's fine wandering spirits

1210
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:26,000
is centered on a gravestone there is a new visual okay yeah very very cool no mike knows it's all right

1211
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:37,000
leaks moving on to uh unique number three soul of the mountain soul of the mountain now lately we've

1212
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,000
been playing some machine gun spriggan on stream and maybe or maybe not we are preparing for a new

1213
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:53,000
uh primalist relic which is this so with the soul of the mountain you're gonna get one max uh veil

1214
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:00,000
spirits per your 15 attunement spirit thorns has three percent less cast speed per veil spirit gain

1215
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
a veil spirit every second while in spriggan form increased health regen increased spell critical strike

1216
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,000
chance poison and physical resistance and the implicit is leech

1217
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:20,000
people in chat are saying oh my gosh so many builds to play i know i that's what i'm saying i know

1218
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
the minion leech here i think is really is is really the important part because it's like it's that

1219
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:36,000
passive healing yep moving on who does anybody want to talk about this one the descent

1220
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,000
smite this is one where people were like no freaking way i don't even know if you guys can see it my

1221
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
belt yeah i know you guys like this one

1222
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:56,000
just to note the mana potion portion of this cannot crit i see i will read it this new belt 45 chance to

1223
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:03,000
cast smite on hit maximum six per 10 seconds this cool stone resets when you use a potion using a

1224
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:10,000
potion restores volatile reversals cooldown with at least 50 intelligence volatile reversal deals 20

1225
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:19,000
multiplicative void damage with less than 50 intelligence volatile reversal is converted to fire up to 25

1226
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:27,000
intelligence increased chance to find potions 55 percent mana gained on potion use everyone's like my fire vr

1227
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:36,000
now while we're looking at this item i thought we could talk for a second about um your guys's vision on

1228
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:45,000
roll ranges inside of uniques and i bring that up because this item specifically has a can roll 4

1229
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:53,000
to 25 intelligence how does that is like what what makes you think or even like you know ranges are

1230
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
exciting right i like like uh yeah we we like roll ranges internally i think we were uh kind of

1231
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:05,000
conservative in this regard early on and i think we are loosening up on making roll ranges um

1232
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
lower minimums higher maximums yeah what about negative

1233
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:17,000
no you don't know we do we do have that yeah okay i i think there's it depends on the type of

1234
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
stat it is as well intelligence is one of those stats that it's like it runs itself really well to

1235
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,000
this like big range um and there's certain other things that'll be on items where like the mechanic

1236
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
needs to be a certain level of consistency to feel like it's it's doing something or have an impact

1237
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,000
that roll range will be tightened up a fair bit as well so it's like it does depend on what the stat is a

1238
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,000
lot but where we can do longer or bigger ranges we are doing that a lot of times and we sometimes in

1239
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:49,000
like um that's one of the things that we let creators with like supporter uniques uh have influence over

1240
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
quite a bit is the role ranges we ask quite often like how big do you want the role ranges on your item

1241
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:59,000
to be and what's cool about that now is we also have an extra tool on our tool belt to be able to

1242
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:05,000
re-roll the ranges on in with unique items including the implicits so that's pretty neat as well

1243
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:14,000
which lets us open up the ranges even more as well i see crystal wind now we're taught looking at a

1244
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:22,000
new quiver that is coming this is a high-end quiver this is level 77 and on here for this new quiver

1245
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:30,000
you guys get ready for your uh heart seeker marksman's the implicits are armor chance to shred armor on hit

1246
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and armor shred effect gain four stacks of crystal wind per second while moving and four stacks when

1247
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:43,000
you evade maximum eight directly using a bow attack consumes up to four stacks of crystal wind to deal 15

1248
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:52,000
multiplicative damage per stack 75 chance to slow bosses and rare enemies on hit per stack chance to

1249
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:02,000
petrify other enemies on hit per stack of crystal wind consumed 10 increase movement speed up to 10 increase

1250
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
cool down speed who wants to talk about petrify

1251
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
it's uh very similar to stun and freeze i definitely wasn't being silent waiting for what it was because i

1252
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:25,000
i couldn't remember anything it's been did you get a visual uh like a skin that goes over them uh

1253
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
like turn turning into stone uh that locks them in place this is like majoss's ability right yeah yeah

1254
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:39,000
yeah okay petrify like this coming i'm a big fan of this item yeah one thing to note here is that a lot of

1255
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:47,000
the oftentimes we have uniques that have their like own uh like subtypes that you cannot drop

1256
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:56,000
normally outside of the unique this is an actual i believe new keyword subtype that isn't limited to

1257
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:04,000
the unique so it's just a new end game cooler subtype as well very cool i'll double check that you're

1258
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:11,000
checking around at petrify no the if that subtype is droppable i'm pretty sure it does drop naturally

1259
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:19,000
yeah countenance of majassa this is a new iron glass shield by the way earlier somebody was begging me

1260
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:26,000
begging me to ask you guys to put in shield cosmetics so this is just me saying that i would promise to do

1261
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:34,000
it so now i've done it uh a new shield coming this is level 72 so in the implicits you've got block

1262
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:42,000
chance and block effectiveness each second every enemy looking at looking at each second every enemy

1263
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:51,000
looking at you has up to a 20 chance to be petrified for two seconds so if i've got a minion army and the

1264
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:58,000
enemies are fighting my minions they're not looking at me right is that kind of is that the idea behind

1265
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:05,000
this looking at me i think it's just comparing the rotation so i think if i think if i'm blocking

1266
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:12,000
line of sight it still works yeah holly can probably confirm i just assumed it was aggro but you know

1267
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:18,000
uh holly can confirm okay it's it's better than the enemy enemies when you block an enemy said

1268
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:25,000
got it when you block an enemy's hit it has up to a 20 chance to be petrified for two seconds 30 of

1269
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:31,000
block effectiveness applied to damage over time as if it's been blocked 600 block effectiveness

1270
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:38,000
it's pretty some of these uniques are pretty cool some of these uniques are pretty cool the

1271
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
chance to petrify just to note at the top that 20 is it's an up to 20 so like boss and rares it's

1272
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:54,000
significantly less got it but technically you could petrify a boss yeah this might be a

1273
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:02,000
it might be getting a nerf in the future i think the what's already is it's really low so that might

1274
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:09,000
get changed in the some time in the future but it's a it's a very powerful unique we need this to

1275
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
petrify your abro not for season two for season two it'll stay this way yes okay it'll go untouched this

1276
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,000
season for sure yes now we may even double it literally everyone's screaming at carve now in the chat

1277
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:28,000
don't nerf it yet okay this is one go ahead go ahead oh sorry yeah one slight one slight tangent

1278
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:34,000
on effects like petrified freeze one thing we're working on at the moment um is an update uh to

1279
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
freeze so visually that'll look better on enemies and we're looking into having enemies shatter into

1280
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
chunks of ice on death and things like that like these like these sort of elements have a big combat

1281
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,000
feel improvement because you can tie in a bunch of uh like audio cues to that sort of stuff as well

1282
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
just very satisfying i just wanted to put that out here it's one thing we're looking at at the

1283
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:59,000
moment so there's been a lot of changes to the feel of combat coming up yeah yeah we we we we're

1284
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:05,000
constantly working on this um you know uh i think judd mentioned this earlier on um we are working on

1285
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,000
some core animator updates for player characters um this will give us a lot more control over things

1286
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
like uh changing the running animation depending on your movement speed um we're looking at lean

1287
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
animations for when your character's turning um we're looking at uh attack recovery and movement

1288
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
blending so that the stutter step you see but if you if you're moving forward and using swipe arrive

1289
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
that'll look a bit smoother um and of course you know we're just looking at updating general animations as

1290
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,000
well looking is conservative we are actively doing this and they are awesome

1291
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
yeah just just just being careful just being careful just for sure for sure but they're

1292
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:47,000
yeah and really good updates the team is making yeah uh yeah and and just on the combat field side

1293
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,000
of things you know regarding sound effects as well we're working on improving the overall sound mix

1294
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:56,000
there so that you know you should be hearing things coming through better with that particular focus

1295
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:03,000
on head sounds there as well okay that shield as well just a note it is the legendary potential

1296
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:09,000
level on it is lower than its level so it is easier to get lp than most level 72 uniques i was

1297
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
gonna move off the shield chad is laughing saying the look on carves face carp knows it's broken and

1298
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:21,000
it's he's already pre-nerfing it it's super funny he knows it he knows it he doesn't just dual wield

1299
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:27,000
shields you can do that well kind of you kind of do that all right everybody this is one i have been

1300
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:34,000
biting my tongue about for uh i don't know since i found out of its existence this is mantle of the pale

1301
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:45,000
ox this is a brand new body armor unique and on here it it is it's it's unbelievable 24 of damage

1302
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:54,000
redirected to your highest health minion up to 24 uh 32 increased health for you and your minions up to

1303
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:02,000
10 movement speed 16 to strength and up to two strength or up to two minion skills strength uh minions

1304
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:10,000
and for anyone wondering no this is not does not work with falcon because falcon doesn't take damage

1305
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,000
yeah this doesn't work with falcon nice try but maybe my uh uh summon bear build carve would this

1306
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:24,000
work with my son yeah yeah yeah that's a strength minion isn't it it is yeah you know what sucks though

1307
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:31,000
i mean as much i mean i plan on using this but the bear set also has a chest which i feel like you

1308
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:37,000
guys probably thought of that knowing that using this with the set so then i gotta i gotta think

1309
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:46,000
about it but anyways yes this new mantle the pale ox that if you are any person using a single minion

1310
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:54,000
build uh 24 of damage redirected to your highest health minion very very cool is the the one to two

1311
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:00,000
range on the strength minion skills so like if you get like a three lp but it's like one that's a lot

1312
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
less value than if it happens to roll a two on there this is just thinking about that carve can

1313
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:12,000
this roll three lp is that you think that's no way i mean everything can different question if it will

1314
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:21,000
uh so yeah all right moving on i don't remember about the lp is flat it's flat yeah oh so you can get two lp on

1315
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:28,000
for sure all right everybody uh this is the final unique to show off this is grasp of the blood mage

1316
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:34,000
on here you've got in the implicit armor increased cooldown recovery speed and some other stats up to

1317
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:41,000
25 percent of hit damage taken from bosses and rare enemies is dealt over five seconds or four seconds

1318
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:51,000
so good chance to bleed on spell hit leech on spell hit spell crit chance and 200 250 of mana spent

1319
01:34:51,000 --> 01:35:01,000
reflected to damage as on you as you to you as damage to you as damage yes yes yes bleed smite people are

1320
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:10,000
saying so this is a new affix right 250 of mana spent reflected to you as damage yep yeah i don't think it's like

1321
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:18,000
it exists anywhere else i think yeah okay so going like mana reduction is actually a defensive

1322
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:25,000
this top affix is what makes this extremely strong so instead of all the damage you know you get hit

1323
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
and you're one shot and you're dead 25 of all hit damage taken from bosses and rare is dealt over four

1324
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:36,000
seconds it kind of saves you from getting one shot or it gives you time to react with you know potions or

1325
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:45,000
whatever you need to do very very very very powerful unique so everybody that is 27 different

1326
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:51,000
clips we have looked at and eight new uniques coming judd do you not talk about how many new

1327
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:56,000
uniques and weavers are we getting uh is it 11 for the weavers guys

1328
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:04,000
i think it's something 20 total yeah yeah it's it's 25 overall it might be slightly less than weavers

1329
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:11,000
will than you said judd maybe eight but perhaps okay yeah it's a quick note on the damage from the

1330
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:18,000
reflected damage from mana that cannot be reduced uh from like damage like damage mitigation stuff

1331
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:32,000
okay okay okay got it two damage big damage all right the final scene god please work let's put ehg on the hot seat

1332
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
all right hello hello no echo everyone can hear me testing testing

1333
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:47,000
all right it doesn't even matter i won't believe it whatever you guys say anyways all right here we go

1334
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:56,000
here we go we have now put ehg behind uh between two portals this is the final scene for uh town portal

1335
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:08,000
podcast episode 10 frosty hit him um okay uh can we go back to the shield real quick no no um

1336
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:14,000
um so i mean i don't oh god i just want to know this if you have i know you're getting rid of the

1337
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:20,000
volatile zombies on potions and belts now they're bees um what happens to the old ones in your in your

1338
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
bags are they changed or do they have like now they're super powerful because they still have

1339
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:34,000
volatile zombies the bees they're bees now the bees everything updates retroactively like that okay

1340
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
what are the chances you guys will drop the update today or tomorrow

1341
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:49,000
oh not very likely zero all right damn i almost had a chance of playing okay um oh geez i got some

1342
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:55,000
lore did bits here when a zombie gets old enough it turns into a bee so oh there we go oh my gosh

1343
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:02,000
uh cannon cannon what what is everyone's spec that they're going to be starting this season with

1344
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:11,000
a heart seeker 100 uh yes this is you know this is a reference to the old diablo 2 guided arrow

1345
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:17,000
but i think a lot a lot of a rpg players understand that we were uh super excited to get the chance to

1346
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:23,000
take that as a base and uh bring it into a new era heart seeker is going to be super cool so heart

1347
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:30,000
seeker for me okay wait judd do you have are you going to do fire heart seeker cold heart seeker

1348
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
triggering puncture heart seeker throwing heart seeker yeah i'm still debating here i really want

1349
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,000
to try just going full physical um i'm debating whether i should do so you've got the multi-shot

1350
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:46,000
node that makes it to where you can uh up front damage is uh increased by 75 i'm not going to take

1351
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,000
that i'm going to take a heart seeker and then i'm just going to be able to spam uh multi-shot from the

1352
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,000
back line so i i think i'm going to try to go full physical and crit to begin with but we'll see

1353
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,000
okay i think i i'm going to change your mind mind right now there is a uh on the fire conversion

1354
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:10,000
there's a buff that grants you fire spell damage and there's a belt that may or may not drop a meteor

1355
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:18,000
on enemies you're it i'm going fire and and and you can turn the heart seeker to provide you mana on it

1356
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:28,000
so okay and there's no nerfing once this goes in right correct unless it's a bug good no no it's

1357
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:35,000
fine not a heart seeker heart seeker would be bug let it be that's actually a good idea carve because

1358
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:42,000
then with uh uh you could actually scale it a spell yeah yeah and then you have it you use a dragon song

1359
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:47,000
to get a dragon's on bro you get the media and then you use it to generate your money yeah yeah so then all

1360
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,000
you need is just a high crit chance to drop your meteors that's a good idea yeah

1361
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
with enough recurve chance like you don't even need that high of a crit chance to

1362
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:04,000
pretty frequently get crits yeah yeah and uh what else are you guys playing i think ross mike what are

1363
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:11,000
your starters yeah well uh i i've i've changed a couple of times um if the change for the witchfire

1364
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
unique does you know it does have that area i'm probably playing uh warlock there um i just need to

1365
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
check that that change got in because it was a last minute addition uh it hopefully it's not in

1366
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,000
a hotfix and if if that's in that's what i'm playing i'm sure it's on the the last page of patch notes

1367
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:34,000
oh nice nice we should read those out yes i'm i'm probably going physical bleed heart seeker that's my plan

1368
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:43,000
i'm gonna do the build that i wanted to play but i just couldn't bear with the the volatile

1369
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
reversal stuff so i'm gonna probably gonna start with the mono stacking uh

1370
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:55,000
judgment paladin with an aura and then just just say you're starting righteous fire just say you're

1371
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:01,000
gonna try and do it we know i can't you know you'll judge me so i can't all right you're right

1372
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
i guess that's fair that's fair i mean it's a judgment so it makes sense

1373
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:15,000
was that was that everyone that was everyone yeah okay what are you struggling with guys um you know

1374
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:22,000
you made the decision to allow us to respect our mastery which is something that ehg in the past

1375
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:30,000
wasn't sure they wanted to do what about maybe letting our pets be able to pick up gold not anything

1376
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:35,000
else we got to pick up the shards and we got to pick up the keys and we got to look at the loot

1377
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:42,000
and we got to click on the woven echoes but maybe you know that capybara's got a gold pack on its back

1378
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:49,000
and the loot lizard pet has a gold pack on its back what about maybe uh pets pick up cool

1379
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:57,000
if we ever were to do that and i don't think we currently have plans to do that we would have some

1380
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:02,000
way of providing everyone a pet that would do that for free okay correct right so i don't think we

1381
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:11,000
are planning to do that okay okay out of all of you who's most likely to be taking down uber aberroth

1382
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:18,000
this season oh that's a good one oh mike you're saying it's probably yeah it's probably not good

1383
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:27,000
it's not gonna be you mike no down to carve that way carve okay all right i mean that's fine

1384
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
unfair i'm already done it but oh all right who's the next who's next

1385
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
on the line i'll race you guys

1386
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:45,000
there you go you'll you'll see you'll see me die on the ladder for sure oh on my way there yeah uh

1387
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:51,000
something that gets brought up pretty frequently is the thoughts around hideouts and being able to

1388
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:59,000
uh provide ehg with an endless flow of money by allowing us to kind of have that end of the world

1389
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:07,000
completion area be almost like a mini hideout where we can decorate it and make it look cool

1390
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:16,000
any thoughts on hideouts you know we have had conversations about this uh it is something that we are

1391
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:26,000
warm to there's a lot of technology that would go into creating a hideout hub type system uh it would be

1392
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:33,000
unlike other hideout hub systems that you guys have seen if we do it uh but yeah there's there's

1393
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:40,000
discussions there's there's talks internally about the potential there okay very cool um

1394
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,000
are you currently working on any spell cosmetics that aren't going to make it into the new season

1395
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
but they're definitely being worked on right now and what are they

1396
01:43:50,000 --> 01:44:00,000
there are definitely some that are being worked on right now yeah yes um i'm unsure we could talk a

1397
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:08,000
bit specifics um i mean it's just us it's no one else's he's here right right uh very private

1398
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
yeah we're gonna we'll pass on that one for now okay okay no worries uh

1399
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:23,000
uh i would love when mike is streaming on friday to be able to go hostile and we could duel and have

1400
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:31,000
some fun in pvp any thoughts you know non-serious pvp not like we're stealing each other's loot

1401
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,000
any idea for like dueling or anything like that in the future for pvp you know it's it's something that

1402
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:42,000
we've always wanted uh it's it's one of those things that we really just need to have it be like a

1403
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
a few day project where we get a couple developers to go and prototype that because i don't think it

1404
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:53,000
would actually be very hard to implement a dueling system uh now the concern with any type of pvp in a

1405
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:59,000
game like this is as soon as you say pvp people have uh expectations you know some some higher than

1406
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:07,000
others yeah um and as soon as you add expectations and pvp into a a an action rpg centered around character

1407
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:15,000
power and loot uh balance is very very hard i i think if we could if we could set expectations

1408
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:24,000
correctly entering something like a dueling system would be very possible uh yeah we need to have

1409
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:31,000
like a weekend jam on something like that very cool okay uh this is another uh each of you a question

1410
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:36,000
are you starting this season on legacy or season and are you going merchant's guild or circle of fortune

1411
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:50,000
oh wow season cof season cof yeah yep season or it's all hardcore cof of course i need to get all

1412
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:59,000
right all good good answers uh judd the top dog the initial person the first person to put out the

1413
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:07,000
reddit post the reason why this game exists um since the kickstarter days last epoch has come so far

1414
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:12,000
it's been like kind of one of the more favorite things as we watch the kickstarter video to just see

1415
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:19,000
how the game has progressed and what you guys have done which is just truly incredible do you feel like

1416
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:26,000
uh the vision that you had for last epoch is truly coming to fruition in season two

1417
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:37,000
yeah it's it's incredible uh to have started where we started and be here it's it's really surreal in

1418
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:45,000
a whole lot of ways uh for those that don't know last epoch started as a reddit post in 2017

1419
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:51,000
where i wanted to make the next great action rpg and found a bunch of really passionate people i was

1420
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:56,000
really fortunate to find you know skilled developers and artists and musicians that were excited about you

1421
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:03,000
know potentially taking that journey with me um yeah and then my goal has always been to

1422
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:12,000
get a bunch of die hard arpg enthusiasts together so we can get into a room and debate what the best

1423
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,000
systems for an action rpg could possibly be just get a bunch of people that love it know it deeply

1424
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:25,000
debate what's going to be the best and uh we have fostered a team that is exactly that and so

1425
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:33,000
the the vision for the game it it continues to evolve it will continue to evolve going forward

1426
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,000
um but i think as long as we have the right people in here and we can have really good healthy debates

1427
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
as a team we will consistently make good decisions to make the game great so yeah i think i think it's

1428
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:52,000
going in the right the right i love it so cool so awesome ah well yeah i don't i think i don't know if i

1429
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
i i got one more thing here i mean speaking of the the vision and future vision of the game

1430
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,000
are you guys planning on like this this season coming out it's like a it's like an expansion um

1431
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:12,000
are you ever going to make like a an expansion to the game or are you just going to keep it as is and

1432
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:18,000
just do huge changes when it needs to be seasons when it needs to be also for people who own the

1433
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:24,000
game um are you going to ever charge for an expansion coming up or are you still going with

1434
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:32,000
the 35 which is pretty damn reasonable yeah these days um going forward yeah our goal is to make

1435
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:38,000
seasons at a faster pace and be able to monetize those in a way that keeps the studio financially

1436
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:44,000
healthy and growing uh that is the goal we're really hoping to see that season two and the

1437
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:49,000
awesome things that we've added to this and the uh vast improvements we've made with the cosmetic

1438
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:56,000
system cosmetics in general the shop we're hoping to see that that is financially going to keep the

1439
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:06,000
studio in a really healthy spot uh so that's that's the plan nice cool very nice frosty that's it i mean

1440
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:12,000
we did all we went over a lot today and i'm definitely excited to play i personally am going

1441
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:19,000
to be getting that lightning cosmetic pack uh i just made a shaman totem dude recently and i think it's

1442
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
going to look perfectly with it going heart seeker when uh the game comes out and i mean that that's

1443
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:31,000
just my final words i i'm i'm excited okay everybody oh sorry good one one thing we can do to wrap up here

1444
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:38,000
uh because we did have the team say that the stretch build is qa'd and and we'll get across the line

1445
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:45,000
uh they have linked a really cool video of the new monolith hub and some cool tech that we have there

1446
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:50,000
uh i don't know aaron would you be able to access that inside of our discord channel we have that and

1447
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:56,000
then we have the additional patch notes as well yeah you think i can't get that all while we're sharing

1448
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:02,000
six screens and six audio sources that's easy no big deal no big deal not a problem at all all

1449
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
all right everybody be right back uh we've got an echo i'm hearing about this don't say stuff like that

1450
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
no not funny all right guys they're gonna be able to hear you but not see you for a second one second

1451
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
yeah sounds good sounds good

1452
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
so we should make funny faces is that what you're saying this is this is time to do it

1453
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:29,000
this uh this video doesn't include the transitions and things like that based on the one that all

1454
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
is posted no it's just a little isn't

1455
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:42,000
oh i thought this was just a little the cool transitions it is okay i mean it still looks really

1456
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:49,000
nice uh this is this is one look at the monolith hub but there's some really cool stuff as you go

1457
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:54,000
and you traverse through this area uh that'll make it feel like you're hopping between timelines

1458
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:00,000
but this is this is still good it's a good visual it's a good good reference to the visual quality

1459
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
upgrades oh yeah the lighting on this looks awesome i can't wait for other people to see it on stream

1460
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
can't wait for them to take a look at it

1461
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:18,000
start reading out the new patch notes that are going on there all right mike hit us

1466
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
model with progress is now shared across characters using the same match

1468
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:07,000
yeah the new chat commands are sweet yeah that's the one that we should show if we put look at this

1469
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:16,000
professional streamer right here you know geez all right uh here we go everybody this is void island

1470
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:21,000
is that what we're looking at right here void island this is yeah this is in the model of hub this is

1471
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:27,000
one of the timelines when you're actually over in this area um but we have some new tech uh that's

1472
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:33,000
that our team put together that when you transition from timeline to timeline like in the model itself

1473
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:39,000
it'll it'll have this it's just we're just gonna let people go and experience it it's very cool uh

1474
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:46,000
and we're going to be updating the um echo overworld to have some of this tech as well this looks clean

1475
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:54,000
this looks really really good yeah yeah lots of good progress on visuals we've got some new tech art

1476
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,000
talent on the team uh a lot i mean we're just elevating the visuals and the sound of the animations

1477
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:05,000
across the game in like really really major ways and and this is uh this is a good example of that

1478
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,000
oh very cool very good looking very good looking i'm also glad to hear that just

1479
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,000
ever improving the visuals because yes you just keep looking better and better yeah you should go

1480
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:22,000
back and look at the kickstarter videos um we do all the time we've we've come a long way i always

1481
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,000
like pointing out when you guys show the initial classes and masteries i tell the story of the night

1482
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:34,000
and the forgotten night and the end of time and all that good stuff all right here is page 101

1483
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,000
of the patch notes so this was going to be the first hot fix from what ehg is saying and it's

1484
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:49,000
going to make it into uh season two correct yep okay i know it's not super easy to hear see uh general

1485
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:57,000
skills summon wolf summon bear fury leap and summon thorn totems will have new skill icons okay

1486
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
anomaly fix the display issue where mark of rot incorrectly said it caused enemies to take 100%

1487
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:12,000
increase void damage now it says 50% devouring orb fixed a bug where orb masters more void

1488
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,000
eruption damage would not apply unless you had source of increased area of devouring orb

1489
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,000
void knight passive tree singular singular purpose threshold bonus has been clarified to state that it

1490
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:29,000
grants the separate effects of less damage taken from slowed enemies and less damage taken from time

1491
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:36,000
rotting enemies enemies and that these effects are multiplicative which each with each other and

1492
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:42,000
other modifiers let's do this because because a lot of these are fixes this was the first hot fix

1493
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,000
go to the go to the last image with the new chat commands i think that's probably the coolest thing

1494
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:54,000
coming with this stretch build that is not mentioned in the patch notes added new chat commands you get

1495
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:01,000
mike you want to take this one sure so we've got slash deaths uh which lets you know what your death

1496
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:07,000
count is which is the one that you get everyone's gonna know how many times i've died deal with it

1497
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:16,000
oh no all right sorry go on slash corruption or slash max corruption posts a system message to chat with

1509
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:36,000
this is the in-game footage yeah yeah oh my god yeah the really cool the really cool thing about this is

1510
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,000
that it is uh it's tech that we can every time we introduce one of these new systems in a very small area

1511
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:47,000
like this it's always also a new tool that we're going to then look at where else can we use this

1512
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:55,000
type of tech in the game to really make the rest of the game pop as well uh yeah oh yeah i know just

1513
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:05,000
the grassing the effects i know i know chat i know you want to check it out but sorry wow the weather and

1514
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:12,000

1515
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:20,000
push up the audio all right everybody this is this is a long this four minute clip yep it's a walk through

1516
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:38,000
the monolith area gosh it looks so much better gosh it looks so much better how it transitions yeah

1517
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
you get the theming and the feel of the zone that that timeline is

1518
01:57:50,000 --> 01:58:10,000
little bubbles yeah see that and you can hear the the footsteps sound like they're in the area

1519
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:38,000
people really like this they really like yeah they really like it that red side the red um black hole in

1520
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:48,000
the background

1521
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,000
the

1522
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
such a good shot got a fire light rays

1523
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:14,000
you guys i'm not just glazing this is like incredible looking like it looks so good yeah with

1524
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000
some advancements in tech that we have we'll be able to start making the entire game look more

1525
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:27,000
just just beautiful all around um this is uh this is a good example of utilizing some of the new

1526
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
tools and stuff that we have in place

1527
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
does it go all the way up to

1528
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:41,000
the top three did we already finished those this one's one of my favorites i don't know why i didn't

1529
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
say it's really the like the boards and everything and the yeah

1530
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:52,000
that gives you a feel the theme that's coming from that i like this foliage yeah

1531
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,000
and this is i think this is really indicative of the level of attention to detail and

1532
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:05,000
just like the the cool stuff we're able to add uh to the game now and how much faster we're able to

1533
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,000
add these these individual things it's going to just ramp up

1534
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:19,000
i'm glad we came down here i think the effect on that's updated to the centerpiece there

1535
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
that transition never looks bad

1536
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:30,000
i always get like a death mountain vibe from this

1537
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:38,000
a burning black hole this is yeah and the waypoint model too i love the new waypoint model

1538
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,000
like it feels it feels like it fits in the world and it just feels more like

1539
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
appropriate for the for the world and yeah

1540
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:59,000
uh a question that keeps coming up um dlss or fsr when is that uh it's ready when it's ready

1541
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
in development in development

1542
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
what is that

1543
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
you'd have to ask him on that one

1544
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
no no i meant the the uh there was there's a there's a meme that's just stuck in my head

1545
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
when he's like in development in development in development

1546
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:32,000
yes i i do i do know what dlss and fsr is sorry we figured that's that's why i posted it

1548
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:47,000
great um obviously we started a little late normally we end the podcast with just taking a few questions

1549
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:52,000
from the community is that all right guys maybe five ten more minutes maximum oh yeah that feels

1550
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:57,000
good okay i kind of almost just want to leave this playing frosty and maybe we just mute it and

1551
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,000
stay on this keep it playing mute it and ask questions let's stay okay just want to be as

1552
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
clear as humanly possible i know a bunch of questions are about to be flooding in me and frosty

1553
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:10,000
are going to do our absolute best to manage them frosty i'm going to take youtube you take twitch okay

1554
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:17,000
all right and i'll and we'll try and we'll just do some rapid fire uh questions all right

1555
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:25,000
hash notes when first one i saw yeah right that's when like six hours ago uh

1556
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,000
um are there server stability i know we kind of touched that already you guys like

1557
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,000
yeah uh to recap we're feeling very good about service ability for the launch of uh

1558
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:46,000
the upcoming patch so we invite everyone to join us right on time 11 o'clock okay any any plan on new

1559
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:46,000
classes

1560
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:54,000
we love classes that's what i'll say we love class okay all right you have a list of like

1561
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
10 classes and masteries already like you know i bet you're right

1562
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
could be right yeah got it got it

1563
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,000
there's such a gigantic backlog of things of like wouldn't it be awesome if we could just make

1564
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,000
this we've got to pick the ones that are the most important um do you guys feel confident that

1565
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:26,000
seasons moving forward will have new sets yeah yes yeah okay um panda mtx for beastmaster bear

1566
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
sounds cool please

1567
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:39,000
okay yeah or capy bear uh huh maybe but only only just i'm sure holly just heard you say capy

1568
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
bear and it's like already doing this okay perfect

1569
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,000
for the for the banda it's it's going to be paid to lose because it has to just randomly like fall off

1570
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:56,000
cliffs and whatnot yeah just roll around roll around in the action that makes any any chat system or

1571
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
friends list updates

1572
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:07,000
i mean chat system yeah the announcements the announcements coming with the chat system there

1573
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:12,000
used to be like this terrible bug that was lasted way too long where there would be like large gaps

1574
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:19,000
whenever chat was very active uh we've we fixed some issues like that um the polling update time

1575
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:27,000
like so it updates faster like populates your friends list faster didn't we do that

1576
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
yeah that's been worked on since 1.0 though that's that typically happens very fast now

1577
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:42,000
okay uh people are asking on youtube chat uh sounds for the loot filter sounds for the loot filter

1578
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:51,000
uh very very very common request we hear you there is a lot more that we are going to do for the loot

1579
02:04:51,000 --> 02:05:00,000
filter and we hear you on that one yes okay um there was a major class rework this season is there

1580
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:13,000
going to be going to be another class rework for next season um yes kind of and that's and that's and that's all we'll say for now uh yes yeah if there is there is there is a there is a

1581
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:20,000
we could i mean you could co-calculate like co-calculate how many threshold notes each mastery has that's true

1582
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:31,000
um for the people out there that love lore love um you know the world of a terra next act of the campaign

1583
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:43,000
it's uh it's it's shaping up very well it's really cool okay it's in active development in active

1584
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,000
development act 10 of the campaign

1585
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:54,000
is there is there anywhere people can follow carve and do you do as many leaks

1586
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
on your socials as you do on the podcasts

1587
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
i've done some in the past on the uh

1588
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:12,000
join our yeah join our discord join our forums and we we are very active there and uh

1589
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:17,000
uh typically we don't mind sharing things that aren't like needing to be held back for like a

1590
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:22,000
big marketing beat or something like that we're as a studio we're pretty leaky we're just excited about

1591
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
stuff so yeah i mean join us on our socials and stuff like that and we give a lot of information

1592
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:34,000
oh sorry go ahead you can usually trick us into saying something right yeah also i don't i don't leak i

1593
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:41,000
tease okay yes it's different yes uh mike i know you've answered this question a ton on friday's stream

1594
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:49,000
but i am seeing it spammed quite a bit um guilds clans even if it's just a way to chat with friends

1595
02:06:49,000 --> 02:07:02,000
any thoughts on guilds and clans um we've always wanted guilds because of the uh chat and like the

1596
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:09,000
chat capabilities that it brings but it's like we feel like if we were to say hey we've brought guilds and

1597
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:14,000
like the guilds me that you can chat with your friends in a different colored text that's not

1598
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:19,000
quite hitting the mark that feels like we can even call it that um so it's it's one of those things if

1599
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:26,000
you guys have uh ideas for what guilds could be that would be really awesome and additive for last epoch

1600
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,000
specifically we would love we would love to hear that um it's something as a team we've been interested in

1601
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:40,000
since forever okay um let's see what do you guys know the rough estimate of the size of the patch for

1602
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:47,000
the season oh that's a good question oh like like data like gigabytes 50 gigs 100 gigs at least that

1603
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:56,000
download yeah we we typically go and we have uh smaller updates we have a nightly build that happens and

1604
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:03,000
we'll update that build iteratively and so i don't i don't know what the full build actually is at all

1605
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:10,000
one million gigabytes yeah we just see like oh this update was like half a gig or two gigs and and we

1606
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
can't just add those all together because it can be the same thing that changes from day to day and

1607
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:20,000
um so we don't have a situation where we've taken like a a jump from the base all the way to the

1608
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:31,000
like 1.17 all the way to 1.2 um we're starting uh the download the moment the patch goes live or is

1609
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
there any pre-download

1610
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
don't think there's any pre-download

1611
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:47,000
we know people want to see what we can do eventually okay it's like a technical thing where

1612
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:51,000
people will be able to start playing it immediately offline right so that's what i've heard is that if

1613
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,000
you guys allow pre-download then offline players could play immediately or i don't know if that's

1614
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:02,000
right right yeah right there's some steam encryption stuff that we might be able to use but it's i don't

1615
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:06,000
know if there's like problems with that or something yeah the team the team is saying like the true

1616
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:11,000
offline mode does make that pretty problematic uh if there is a way to get around that i haven't

1617
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:15,000
personally discussed that very heavily with the team but it's not it's not as easy if it was just a

1618
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:22,000
fully online game judd if it was a perfect world and you could snap your fingers how long would it be

1619
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:33,000
in between seasons oh daily no every day every day is season day um no i mean i i think i think

1620
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:40,000
you know around that three three and a half month is is about ideal that's that's what we would aim to

1621
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:48,000
be doing um hard to do it's hard to produce content uh that that quickly uh but the team the team is

1622
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,000
growing uh we're getting way better at doing parallel content development and you know it's uh

1623
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:59,000
we're certainly closer than ever to being able to release seasonal content faster awesome um even

1624
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,000
though you're pretty much character gets completely covered is there any updates to the character model

1625
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:11,000
plan for the future yes yes there there's there's some things like some of our character models like

1626
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:17,000
the skin textures and stuff don't look as as nice as we'd like them to and even some like proportional

1627
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:22,000
changes that we believe that we could make that would make them look nicer uh what is the the status on

1628
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:28,000
those ross do you have any idea if there's like an actual status update on that yeah nothing nothing

1629
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:38,000
today's just there okay okay totally fine transmog when i know these are like rapid there's just a

1630
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:47,000
million i'm just picking some out of here nothing to announce on that yet no worries okay oh geez

1631
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:57,000
what we've lost the frosty he's lost frosty's gone yeah frosty said that if uh

1632
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:04,000
his baby circle he said if his baby's coming that he'll he'll have a backup plan no i'm here

1633
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:12,000
wife went into labor i said dude like obviously take care of your wife but if your wife goes into

1634
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:18,000
labor during stream it's going to be excellent content that's what i told oh my god could you oh

1635
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:25,000
oh i i can't believe this did get not this didn't get brought up secret lizard level somebody's gotta

1636
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:34,000
spill or say something like what uh yeah what are you talking about um if you're finding lizard tails

1637
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:42,000
i would certainly buy a stash and store those lizard tails at least honestly that is unacceptable i will

1638
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:48,000
absolutely accept that i would i would i wouldn't use details yeah the good memories that you helped

1639
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:55,000
poor lizards were super burdened overburdened right dude everybody in chat you know what that means if

1640
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:02,000
you find lizard tails keep them keep them that there is no lizard level just to be clear don't go looking

1641
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:10,000
for a lizard level but um you should not you should not get rid of them you should not get rid of them

1642
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:18,000
you could have up to 200 stash tabs they if you were to get every stash tab i think it would cost

1643
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:24,000
about 190 million gold uh one of those can be for lizard tails for sure there you go all right let's

1644
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:31,000
do five more questions uh somebody on here said is it possible in the future to get a price checker for

1645
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:39,000
the bazaar yes we we've we've we've talked we've talked about this there's a yeah there's a there's a

1646
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:45,000
there's a few uh ui ux uh additions need to make to the bazaar uh one is uh you know improving the

1647
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:52,000
unique search we basically don't have enough uh you know a there's not enough power to the unique

1648
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:58,000
search and and it's difficult to know how to price things we've had conversations uh about how we would

1649
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:05,000
implement a price checking um so that's these are discussions that are happening uh but nothing to

1650
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:12,000
announce yet there but but yes we've we've talked about it okay i'm back now i think are you are you

1651
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:18,000
good frosty yeah you know you know it was nearing the end i had some big technical problem i i need

1652
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:22,000
some attention too it can't just be you aaron that makes me feel yeah thank you for messing no problem

1653
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:31,000
um now this might be an abstract question but are there any other games ehg might be creating on the

1654
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:38,000
back end instead of last epoch last epoch is the only game that we have in development okay

1655
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:48,000
is it possible to implement a pause feature in the future right now offline has pause online does not

1656
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:55,000
right yeah it's uh it's something that we have the team looking at how that could possibly happen it is

1657
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:04,000
much more complicated than anyone would initially suspect and it gives a lot of potential for um

1658
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:12,000
abuse cases uh edge cases where things could be messy uh it's something we very much want uh

1659
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:23,000
but it's not coming season two season three probably okay um considering the game is only 35 and people

1660
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:29,000
really do like the game and want to support you what is the best way to support the company

1661
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:34,000
outside of just buying two copies of last epoch oh here comes the merch store question

1662
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:42,000
sorry it's funny you know i mean uh i mean like the genuine answer to that is like if you love the game

1663
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:48,000
tell tell your friends that you really enjoy it um multiplayer is significantly better than it ever has been

1664
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:54,000
party play um leave a leave us a good steam review those are always helpful um yeah those are the

1665
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:05,000
things that typically uh frosty i don't i think i'm good on my end and everybody please stick around

1666
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:11,000
i'm going to be giving away two copies of last epoch at the end of today's stream yeah that's that's it for

1667
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:18,000
