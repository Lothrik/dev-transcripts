4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
who's got who's got questions for me huh about where we're at all right

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:43,000
yeah so we have a little little chill time hanging out in the uh the monolith killing some bosses

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
right at the top or the top of the stream we've got a couple little housekeeping things as usual

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we do stream for charity our charity is right above my head right here so all the everything goes to

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that um second thing if you have a question please feel free to ask it i'll be happy to answer it

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
please put at last epoch game in the chat um we pulled questions from twitch and from youtube so

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
uh wherever you are we've got you covered um and i'll i'll get those and i'll be happy to answer

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
them um we do have if anyone case anyone missed it i assume that most people that are here have

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
probably heard but we are um moving our release date for season two to april 17th um gonna be a

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
fantastic launch looking forward to it very much um we do we are moving the twitch drops um

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
that we're gonna be happening alongside the launch to the new launch window as well so those

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
happen between april 17th and april 21st the same same time window everything's the exact same just

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:03,000
shifting it uh so that it's makes sense um and the new we are also uh we are also moving the the date

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
that the old supporter packs are going to be vanishing from the shop um so that's these supporter packs

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
they are being replaced with new ones um but they are going to coexist with the new ones for a little

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
while uh after um after the patch launches so we're going to be those are going to be sticking

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
around until april or may 2nd sorry so you'll have you'll have a couple weeks to to have both of those

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
side by side and make a decision which one you like the best um and the last two dates on our

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
um podcast tour around the world uh with with with try and uh the second one with aaron and frosty

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
uh those have been moved to april 8th and april 11th respectively so a bunch of bunch of numbers

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
bunch of dates lots of those all available up on our uh news channels on discord on our forums

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
there's a post on reddit i believe you know so we put it out to all the places of this post if you

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
want to review that again check out one of those places um but we're pushing everything back about

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
two weeks and all everything's being adjusted to be um respectively the same time hope that all makes

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
sense i think i might need to pick a little bit harder content for this character because it's a

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
little bit better than this i'm kind of just cruising through not even using my abilities

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
except this guy's got some beef to him

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:41,000
there we go

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
all right uh let's start with some questions let's get let's get it going

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
oh all right any downside to forge guard uh the two-handed weapon plus shield passive yes there is i don't know

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
what it is off the top of my head i think it might be attack speed

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
either damage or attack speed i think

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
i can't remember what it is i'm sorry

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
or possibly both

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
um we'll we'll get we'll get the details of that for uh actual numbers because i don't it's not a huge

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
uh huge downside

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
all right can we get patch notes sooner than later so we can theorycraft builds

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
i just a little aside i just learned um i just learned where the term theorycraft comes from

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and i i had no idea so i thought it was cool this is um i saw a little day nine short and he was

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
explaining this um i i feel it's the sort of thing that uh he's an expert on but uh feel free to fact

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
check this um it was that people were playing like when early days of starcraft one there was people

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
who were not actively playing uh starcraft but were theorizing on the best way to play starcraft

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and as sort of like uh uh like i don't like a jab like an internet like like uh that's not that's not

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
the right way to do things it was all you're just playing theorycraft um

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
i i i i had no idea it was like a bad term initially which i thought was was pretty cool

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
which doesn't really matter or mean anything but uh whatever uh as far as the question with patch notes

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
uh patch notes i don't have a specific date but the patch notes are also getting pushed back

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
a similar amount of time so it's going to be um uh you know closer to the launch date still

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
um and we won't be pushing them out early i'm sorry uh hey mike i was wondering if there's a

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
possibility we'll see mirror image support for mage kind of cool skill node with no support

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
yeah i i maybe not in season two um it's one of those it's one of those nodes that's interesting

55
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
because it is i think the only minion support at all in mage um it is it is way

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
off on an island and when we were originally designing

57
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
uh runemaster we considered making runemaster a minion based mastery um ultimately we didn't

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and i'm very pleased with the direction we ended up going with it

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
we kind of made the decision that mage would be a non-minion class um so i think it's pretty

60
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
unlikely that we'll see much in the way of mirror images getting uh any sort of buff hey look at that

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
there's something you don't see every day if you haven't seen that before uh it's a little easter

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
egg um potion health potions have a chance to drop as beer um and they have exactly the same

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
stats it doesn't mean anything it's just a little like hey it's funny um if you can't pick it up you

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
have to use one first there you go it says plus on potion

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
all right what do you plan on doing during those two extra weeks pre-launch uh there's a like there's

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
a few little things we're gonna we're gonna sneak in there's stuff that we had um there's stuff that

67
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
we had planned for early hot fixes so like we when we're leading up to a patch we we get to a point

68
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
where we're like okay this build is like it's functional there's no major bugs it's solid it's

69
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
really good we're we're confident in its its stability and its qualities there um and we're

70
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
gonna this is what we're gonna launch with and so we we actually already had gotten to that point

71
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
where uh we're like okay we're done adding new stuff for this build now and um we decided to push a

72
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
little bit the uh we kind of opened that up and said okay the things that we're gonna go in hot

73
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
fixes we're now gonna put into the main build and we'll do more stuff into hot fixes after the after

74
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the um after the season drops so it's gonna be there's gonna be some little things mostly just

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
minor bug fixing um some little quality of life stuff uh something that just here here's something

76
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that just got put in today that i'm very pleased about that wouldn't have been in um otherwise so

77
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
you can you can you can thank the delay for this this screen this probably would have come in like

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
a hot fix on like day one or two or something like that so it's not really that big of a deal but

79
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
um this screen there's now a little label that shows up here that tells you your um the timeline

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
corruption so all of them all all of the timelines have like a little like like 4 000 um that says

81
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
the timeline corruption there so you can you can track your timeline corruption from the screen and

82
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:41,000
see it uh bigger you know like like little things like we're just doing more polish um looking at like

83
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
little feel things um so like uh picking up pick up radius for items we were evaluating revaluating

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that today um just just little things like that that are sort of like um as we as we play test more

85
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
we get a better feel for things and we um just catch a little minor changes so you know it's

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
there's always there's always room for more stuff to make it in and uh we're trying to do

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
low risk high reward things because we just don't have the uh the time for for big testing on major

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
features

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:33,000
i should drop some of this stuff i really don't need most of it i'm pretty sure we're just we're

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
just gonna start chucking stuff on the ground it's happening oh my gosh what is he doing crazy person

91
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
i just can't help but pick things up is the problem so we're just gonna drop it all in the ground

92
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
don't crafty materials having those go directly to your crafting material stash is so nice okay we're

93
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
just gonna we're just gonna share this node wholesale i think so the um i'm doing this the wrong way

94
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
we're doing it this way because here you go first unplanned impromptu spoiler

95
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
uh so it is

96
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
uh less damage uh and less attack and cast speed um and haste grants added block chance

97
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
here we go

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
all right are there any plans for further improvements to the graphics engine of the game

99
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
not necessarily oh that jumped a lot not necessarily soon just at some point oh yeah definitely um we're

100
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
always we're always cooking on the um on the graphics like there's sometimes it's engine based

101
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and like uh more of like a high level thing that a high level change that affects things like a

102
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
shader change that can affect all sorts of things in the game that's i think that's something that

103
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
a lot of people would associate as like an engine update or engine improvement as it affects everything

104
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
um but then we're also doing things where like we just make the vfx for something look better because

105
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
we did a better job the second time around you know um so all both those things are on the list

106
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and we're doing them

107
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,000
all right is there a reason why the gamblers take so much time between gambles

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:26,000
um yes do i remember exactly what that is no um i think part of it was that the

109
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
just didn't want to incentivize spamming gambling which i think once we took away the ability to get

110
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
really good items from the gold gambling um kind of removed the need for it

111
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:54,000
all right oh some cool little stuff there

112
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
yes glorious

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:09,000
free freezing haven't been here in a while welcome back um are more skins coming with the

114
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:21,000
update oh yes oh yes um we've got new categories of uh of mtx coming we've got new um new stuff for

115
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
existing categories new sets new packs new individual pieces um skills

116
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
uh i don't know if we've teased every yeah yeah we showed we showed a preview of the footsteps in the um

117
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
as one of the twitch drops

118
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
uh there's a few things this this ui this ui here got a bit of a bit of a facelift as well it's

119
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
like these things got pushed up to the side and the skills things takes up more space because you

120
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
can equip like a whole bunch of different skills all at once not just five for triggered abilities and

121
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
things like that um

122
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
yeah it's great

123
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
oh what do we got here i i've i've been missing things i'm how did i miss these things

124
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
vulcan or vellum vellum 1112 thank you very much for the sub i can read so good

125
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and welcome to the party everyone from big madive

126
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
uh cog ratchet and nex morris thank you for the subs as well that's 14 months there cog ratchet wow

127
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
that's a lot of months that's a lot of months much appreciated

128
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
all right

129
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
hello mike nice to hear from you yes i got a question sentinel one is rebuke getting some love

130
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
this season uh no oh he okay yes do i know what it is off the top of my head no

131
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
um basically every sentinel skill got touched in some way

132
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
like there's an idol that ref one of the island chance that references rebuke

133
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
it's one of those problems of like i don't remember exactly what got in

134
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:15,000
get back here thank you oh no not that far

135
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:27,000
all right did i i for i totally forgot to transfer my

136
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
uh stash i think

137
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
did that already

138
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:46,000
sweet

139
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
we've done that already

140
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
having these go direct is so nice

141
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
uh

142
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
any chance we will see timeline bosses turned into uber bosses later down the line it's possible

143
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
it's fully possible

144
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
um

145
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
i think i think taking existing bosses and and like putting twists on them a little bit maybe

146
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
a little bit more advanced functionality and a little bit extra stats is is like that's one of

147
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
those low effort high reward things that we love to do um not that we don't love high effort things as

148
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
well but uh good bang for your buck on development time is always nice

149
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,000
sometimes you get you get stuck though in the constraints of old old design then you start

150
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
reworking the original one then the scope balloons a bit yeah

151
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
are you guys going to try and squeeze in some extra stuff now that you've delayed a bit would be

152
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
nice to get a little more stuff but i'll get if you're focusing on polish yeah i mean we're

153
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
we're squeezing in some more polish stuff basically

154
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:08,000
uh can we have the cosmetics character in menu my drew looks like poop uh yeah sure sounds good

155
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
um in a previous roadmap transmog and dies were slated for 1.4 in the latest roadmap no time is

156
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
specified is there any update time for this and does the team have an updated stance regarding character gender selection

157
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
um

158
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
a few things in there i'm happy to answer them and not die at the same time

159
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and thanks for oh you gotta resub

160
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
jarzul six months thank you very much glad to have you here

161
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
um as for uh dies transmog and character customization i don't have any timeline on any of that for you

162
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
um whether that's next season whether it's the season after that whether the season after that i i i just i just don't know

163
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
um i would um

164
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the state the state none of the stances on this has have changed like it's all stuff we want to do

165
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
um i don't know when we're going to be able to do it uh it's sort of like as soon as possible

166
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but it's you know it's quite a large thing to add so we have to decide if it's like when it's worth it to

167
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
do it the best i pretty well everything's a value proposition so that's a lot of move speed

168
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
haste effect move speed that's nice

169
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
it's actually really nice

170
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
what are we using those are these

171
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
all right i gotta pick up your sets where they here they are give me my sets

172
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
what does this one have

173
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
one of the really cool things with the set affixes that we were able to do is that a lot of set items

174
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
have mods on those slots that you can't get anywhere else um so a lot of the set affixes even if you're

175
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
not using them for the set bonus themselves just having that affix available on that slot in general

176
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
is kind of a nice little thing to work into a build sometimes so like um i don't know i was seeing

177
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
some some like single set items even being uh functional on their own now

178
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
when when made into a like a reforged that i don't

179
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
train whistle

180
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
oh pumping bees we got more and tahariel 47 months oh my goodness that's so many

181
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
i don't know where i don't know where the train whistle is it might be might be my closet that's

182
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
right there but it is like there's stuff i'm still in the process of getting my office all set up oh

202
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the just in the middle of an echo things like that none of those have um none of those have shields

203
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
anymore the shields getting removed from all of those things they're being reserved for major major

209
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
in the chat i'll get funneled to me i've got four pages of them to get through right now and i should

210
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
be going faster um i almost want to just like the trailer up for a second so i can just answer

211
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
questions let's put a teaser up and i'll do i'll do a question batch here uh here's a little uh

212
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
here's here's a little void nay passive sure that's not with that uh how many bug fixes are coming to 1.2

213
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
season two how many bug fixes are coming to season two um there's some bugs that haven't been fixed since

214
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
like 0.8 and i'm wondering what's the priority with old bugs um so the priority is basically just

215
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
it's the same as always been it's it's how um how big of an impact does this have uh how hard is it

216
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
to fix um and it's it's all these things get worked in together to decide what the order of any individual

217
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
bug is there's tons of work that's been done on um on bug fixing all over the place and we are doing more

218
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:54,000
as well um got any teasers and leaks for us after the guys assume cars still employed at ehg yes car

219
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:04,000
is still happily employed at ehg he received no backlash from that endeavor uh uh uh uh any teaser

220
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
yeah i got i got teases i got two ones one right here yeah this one this is our second one actually

221
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
from the stream maybe even third one because you know i think i leaked something else earlier by mistake

222
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
because i'm just being told um when you craft the set shards on two and i know it i skipped one

223
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
oh my goodness uh in one of the interviews you mentioned changes to the ward system is it mostly just

224
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
that it's going not going to be on everything instead of just on the most important mobs yes

225
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
essentially uh there's some there's some number tweaks as well but if not huge changes to the

226
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
system itself uh when you craft the set shards onto items does it only carry over the set bonuses

227
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
or is it also the stats and conversions for instance meteor is lightning so when you let's

228
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
let's talk about this briefly for a second just to get the details out of the way so let's say the

229
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
last bear's fury is the set we are shadowing we shadow this and we get the last bear's fury

230
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
set shard uh thank you uh side knee appreciate the sub uh welcome and so you got the last bear's fury set

231
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:13,000
shard um that one is going to have oh it's not working really great cool managed to make it work um

232
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
okay that one is going we're gonna so there's these four affixes here and we have picked two of these

233
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,000
four affixes to be the two affixes that the f that the shard has um and then and it's always

234
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and we've picked two of these affixes thank thank you kane sorry uh we've picked two of these affixes to

235
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:49,000
be the um to be the affixes that are the last bear's fury set shard um so i i'm not gonna tell you which

236
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
two of these four we've picked but we've picked two of them and that those are the two that that

237
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
shard gives and that shard will always give those two and because it is something that has seven

238
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
tiers it can go all the way it can be exalted um you have to do that a little indirectly with some

239
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
of the new crafting materials but you can get exalted set shards set affixes um we've we've often picked

240
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
ones that are thematically uh strong so things that really feel thematic to that weapon so like um

241
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
um or that that item that really brings forth the feeling of it so that when you put it on an item

242
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it still feels like the same item or a similar item usually um things that are exciting things that

243
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
aren't normally found on that slot stuff like that and things that do scale nicely with seven tiers of

244
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
affixes so something that's just like it's like plus one strength um that doesn't that's not on any

245
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
of them but it doesn't scale great because you can have decimals of strength um that's a bad example

246
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
because we can just put more on the on the affix chart but i'm trying to go quick uh and then if

247
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
you have multiple items of the same set whether that includes the base set items so i can have uh

248
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
like the last bear's helmet and chest piece and then a reforged last bear's gloves and i would get

249
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
the three set bonus because i would have three pieces of the set when you put a shard from a set

250
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
item onto uh an exalted item and make a reforged version of that set item for all intents and purposes

251
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
that item is a set item in that set um so you it counts towards the set bonuses and it has some

252
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
set affixes on it

253
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
whoo

254
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
all right let's take this down so i don't forget

255
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
all right keep going uh when you guys that uh when doing gold monolith would be possible to buff the

256
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
gold pickup range but would it be possible to buff the gold pickup range just for that mono so we

257
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
can actually pick up all the gold that drops um we are looking at pickup range in general not just

258
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
for specific situations because i think it's a little too small uh are you considering any changes

259
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
in the game's ui more specifically the skill bar and health resource orbs um not huge changes there's

260
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
some minor adjustments here and there but for the most part we're very very pleased with it

261
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
uh i wanted to ask if you do have any suggestions please feel free to head over to our suggestions

262
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
channels i'm not gonna say that every time uh but it's sort of implied i wanted to ask if there was

263
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
any thought to adding hideouts yeah we we've we've definitely thought about adding hideouts several

264
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
times um the short version is is that we don't love the idea of pulling people out of communal spaces if

265
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
we can avoid it um but having places that you're already going to with friends to show off your

266
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
hideout and uh customize location is something that we really love the idea of

267
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
it's not coming in season two sorry

268
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
stop picking stuff up mike i know it's pretty but just stop picking it up like come on you can do it

269
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:13,000
restrain yourself glorious experience hey we leveled up at least the abilities did this yeah uh damage

270
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
and lead sure i don't really know what the build was doing but it was working fine before and it's

271
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
gonna work fine afterwards yeah i love that one

272
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
all right

273
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
uh is someone bear getting improvements for the new season uh it's getting some better swipe

274
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
uh functionality so um yes not nothing gigantic

275
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
uh since we are expecting some changes to life is it going to be both recovery and increased amount

276
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
or is there some new life dependent mechanic um i would say more in that there's better availability

277
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and synergy in skill trees for classes that really thematically like to have non-war defenses

278
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
earlier on so you're gonna start you're gonna you're gonna see um things that maybe scale off or

279
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
synergize well with life appearing earlier in passives um and on on in stronger amounts on some items for

280
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:26,000
health regen in particular uh hey mike are there any changes coming to cof or prophecies this season

281
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
that you can talk about that you can change how we can target specific uniques um there's not a ton

282
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:41,000
happening there a lot of that's happening in the uh uh in the weaver tree instead and uh but there's

283
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
some there's some little things there's like a couple new prophecies i think um

284
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
oh crap i can't remember the exact thing we're like removing the need for one of the lenses

285
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
so you'll have more less less pressure on your lenses so you'll be able to customize better there

286
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
um something else we don't do this is a few minor tweaks nothing gigantic

287
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:13,000
all right hey mike oh iron's net are you playing cof or merchant skill that launch of tombs i'm i i

288
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
don't know i think i'm probably gonna play cof i played merchant skill last time uh in the in the

289
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
like in my free time i did really enjoy it but uh i don't know i'm i i really like cof

290
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:36,000
i so frequently play ssf in general anyways it's kind of like it's always has been

291
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
yep back here i shoved it the wrong way

292
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
yeah we did it and leveled up too all right

293
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
i have a question i like last epoch but i think the movement is a bit slow do you think about

294
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
adding items to speed up the movement a bit well we are adding one item in season two that just

295
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
gives you perma haste so uh if you want to go fast there you go

296
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
um overall though we are pretty pleased with the the general speed of most things in the game

297
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
um i can't i can't see there being huge shifts in the like the overalls meta of speed

298
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
i have no idea what we have that we'd want to even take

299
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
what would you even take here i thought i had another category in here

300
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:56,000
let's try and slap some stuff on that why not

301
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
i can't wait for tries uh podcast for for this there's so many things i want to talk about

302
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
i i almost just spoiled one of them right there and i was like

303
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:18,000
nope not allowed to say it all right uh any updates on bringing new mtx into offline play i

304
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:26,000
have no info on this i'm sorry uh will there be a revamp of the necromancer mastery yes not

305
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
not in season two though um we're gonna be focusing on uh some some new stuff for

306
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
uh like lich and some stuff for necromancer like so acolyte will be a bigger focus in our uh um next

307
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:49,000
season after this one there was uh at one point uh planned to be a a new lich skill coming for season

308
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
two uh and that got shoved to the next season and so i think i think we'll see like a a bit of

309
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
uh necromancer stuff at the same time there it feels it feels right putting them together

310
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:14,000
all right uh with the addition of set shards have there been more sets added to the game for example

311
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
there is zero set items and any set bows at the moment uh we haven't added more set items to the

312
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
game in season two but assuming that the news the revamp to the set system goes well which i am

313
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
extremely confident in going well at this point um we are we're going to start adding set items

314
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
again it's been a while since we've added a set item to the game and we kind of wanted to make sure

315
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
that the change to the set system that we had planned was was solid and we were happy with it

316
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
before we really started uh expanding that as well

317
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
ellie is um is also predestined to be played on on the go on steam deck will there be further

318
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
improvements from your side regarding le performance on steam deck or are you concentrating on the pc yes

319
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
we are we are adding more stuff for steam deck um there's more features coming for steam deck there's

320
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
um so controller updates are so nice for what's what's happening on steam deck for gameplay right now

321
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
um we are looking at performance as well we're also looking at um uh ui scaling options so you're

322
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
gonna have multiple options in the settings for uh for ui scaling uh i think it's around here

323
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
something like that there's like uh you can use small medium large gigantic tiny i think there's

324
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:36,000
like five or six options for for ui scale um so much stuff happening my goodness oh it's a huge it's

325
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:45,000
a huge gift pack oh that's a lot so is that 10 wow i am sam thank you very much that's fantastic

326
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:54,000
some other ones before that too didn't we that i missed mind bombing thanks for the sub appreciate

327
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,000
you this is great and salmon so also subbed oh this sub's all over the place it's just i'm just

328
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
gonna turn this off soon it's just just keeps ringing you still hear me though right

329
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:23,000
all right i don't know how to turn it down slightly heavy 46 months whoa whoa feels good thanks buddy

330
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
your uh jug survived the move

331
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
i'm quite pleased about all right it was like one of the four things i wrapped up nicely

332
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
all right i know comparisons are always a bit difficult it's okay we do them all the time but

333
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
still what's something you think peewee does better than le and one where you're better oh

334
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
that's that's that's uh i i really don't like answering questions like this but i will

335
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
because there's one thing that have the peewee 2 has that uh that we don't have that is so awesome

336
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and i would love to have um and and it's it's being able to uh lock a tooltip on screen and have it be

337
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
like its own window that you can move that window around and like anchor a tooltip and actually have

338
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:24,000
it be a a window properly you know like like you have in windows um oh my god oh my god that one that's

339
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
so bad uh the the way our tooltip system works for things like items anyways uh most things

340
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
actually is it's only one object that the contents the object gets changed when it opens so like this

341
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
tooltip is the same as this tooltip as like the game object in the behind the scenes it's just when

342
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
it closes it goes it just turns off and then when you mouse over this in that like one frame that it's

343
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
turning on there's actually one frame delay before it turns on it it changes everything in it to look

344
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
different and then it turns on and that's the same for everything so like um uh like skill tooltips

345
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
same thing like all this is all one object that just keeps getting moved around and change the

346
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
contents of so we'd have to change fundamentally how our tooltips work uh and one where you're better

347
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
i like our crafting system better i do um i i don't think it's a controversial thing to say that you

348
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
enjoy one or the other more um and i think a lot of it comes down to preference there so i don't know if

349
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
oh yeah does he say do better i don't know if it's actually better i enjoy it more

350
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
uh any chance we get a new look at new uniques coming i don't think i have any new uniques prep

351
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
today i got i got some other cool stuff i got some very cool stuff for you don't worry i started slow

352
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:44,000
on the teasers all right uh when will the new supporter packs be available or get sneak peeks the

353
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
new they'll be available uh within the patch drops so not before the patch drops um

354
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,000
they will

355
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
i i i don't know if we'll show them off early i hope we'll show them off early

356
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,000
alask

357
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
all right avalanche is my nemesis

358
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
avalanche is the one ability that will like always somehow kill me i don't know how i survived

359
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
that do i have a ton of cold res no no i'm even undercapped on cold res okay cool

360
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
uh any chance the acolyte gets another melee skill uh she's still missing a lich skill yes

361
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
um that's what i was just just talking about a minute ago i know this question was asked before

362
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
i said that but yes we are uh looking to post season two for another lich um lich melee skill

363
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
um we hate we did no details other than that i don't know what it's going to be we've we got like

364
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
10 percent into the like ideation of the base functionality and then we're like

365
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
uh we don't have time for this

366
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
maybe a little farther than that but not much

367
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
all right have there been uh have there been made any improvements in the audio department for

368
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
the next patch yes i don't dislike the audio in the game but i feel like it lacks a bit more punch

369
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
yeah so we're doing there's there's there's new times when audio can be played more there's there's

370
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
new functionality for control over when certain clips get played when um uh like repeating sounds

371
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
happen and frequency and volume and um yeah there's there's new tools we've added in and new sounds

372
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:38,000
we've added in and you know like sometimes uh the the the the skill mtx the skill cosmetic changes for

373
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
abilities have they come with audio changes as well um and some of the new audio is really nice too

374
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
all right in terms of unique items how they look on characters have you been able to include more

375
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
3d art for uniques to match the 2d there are more yes um percentage wise i think it's actually going

376
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
down because we're adding more uniques faster than we're adding the uh 3d models for them but

377
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,000
yes there there are more uh 3d models that do properly represent their 2d item art than before

378
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
um it's just so much faster to like the code to chain to add a unique like to just make those

379
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
things on screen work is so much faster than making the models

380
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
i heard you get customizable item sets will legendary affixes be extracted and be customizable

381
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
um so i uh reference you back to earlier in the stream this question was probably asked before i

382
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
explain the whole thing but the really short version in case you're new uh because you've

383
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
shown up since then the really short version is you can pull uh predetermined fixed affixes from

384
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:54,000
a set item and place them on a non-unique item uh and that item then becomes the set that the affix

385
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
came from in the first place uh so you can make your own set items and set items reforge set items as

386
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
we call them behave just like the set items they came from and have the same restrictions and same uh

387
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,000
bonuses

388
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:22,000
like set bonuses uh just some data when are you planning to release a new list of legendary items in uh lp tools

389
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
oh um before that um oh that's that second actually so when are you planning to list new

390
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
legendary items in uh last epoch tools i think that's what supposed to be um the third party tools

391
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,000
cannot update their tools until the patch is live um so like you can put yeah basically those those tools

392
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
i i don't know so we we are in contact with the people who make those tools and they do a fantastic

393
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
job on them it's really incredible um but as far as i know they're not allowed to put the content for

394
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
season two up on those until season two releases

395
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
assuming they have access to it through like ct programs and stuff like that

396
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
all right uh as far as the supporter packs we are going to show off the super porter packs early

397
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
um before the patch launches i don't know how early or when exactly but um you will see them before 17.

398
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:32,000
i mean i would assume at least by patch notes time right

399
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
all right uh for those of us who are mage mains and it helps assuage some concerns with the ward hit

400
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
what ward int nerf uh did mage and its masters receive any love in season two anything you want to

401
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
tease show us uh do i have anything here for that i don't have any specific mage stuff but yeah every

402
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,000
every every class every class got a bunch of uh new new cool toys to play with and um a lot of what

403
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
the targeting is about is is targeting the the curve that you gain access to those things on um

404
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,000
so you know maybe we we took away some like early game more retention but we then looked at it and said

405
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
okay well maybe there's some spot we could put like some a little bit more on like a rare item or something

406
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
like that or you know like where it's not always about the total amount of power that any individual

407
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
build has access to in some cases it is but it's not always that in some in some cases it's just the

408
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
um the the rate at which you get them in the leveling and character advancement process that's

409
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,000
the that's the big issue but yes there's there's definitely buffs too um even without them like it's

410
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
really not the end even even if we weren't buffing stuff at the same time uh the sky's not falling

411
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
uh there are still powerful board based builds you don't need to worry about that

412
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
are there any plans to give the arena champions some love so they have complexity

413
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
uh same they have the complexity of other bosses um there's not much being done there uh this patch

414
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
but i would love to expand that i'd love to uh that's one of those things that it's kind of like a

415
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:19,000
a fledgling version of the system i think where i'd love to have um like a reflection of builds that

416
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
that placed high on previous ladders show up as the arena bosses for subsequent seasons that's like

417
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
that's sort of the thing we've sort of internally been like oh wouldn't it be cool if one day we could

418
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
do this type thing i still i still hold out hope for one day that being a thing

419
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,000
chuck some stuff on the ground here because i'm a terrible hoarder

420
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
oh let's do let's do a sushi without sushi

421
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,000
oh this this uh display only shows empowered corruption doesn't show normal corruption just fyi

422
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
it's not a good thing i'm gonna do it

423
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
my face i wanted that

424
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
keep frenzy keep frenzy or berserk what's it called berserk yeah lost it it's okay

425
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
oh we got siphon at one lp oh my god huge drop oh my god

426
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
i'm sure everyone who does shade has a bajillion of those

427
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,000
six corruption ah all right our forge weapon living skins coming uh not for season two but that is

428
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
something that i would love to do more of uh what are your thoughts on changing or mixing up the idle

429
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
grid love it it's something that we so the the idle grid actually does have these spots um those the

430
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
five blocked off spots in the idle grid actually do exist in the code um like there's there's there's

431
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
there's hidden spots right here

432
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:22,000
um and we can we can block off different spots really easily um it's basically just just changing

433
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
the ui there's there's actually like just sprites that are just sitting there's there's there's five

434
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
images that are just sitting here over the grid that block it off visually um and some code to be like

435
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
don't use those spots but yes there's uh we can just change the visuals here and change which are the

436
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
blocked off spots in the uh in the code in the back end and it changes the layout there and that's

437
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
something that we have when we set this up originally that's something that we're like

438
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
okay we want to be able to change this in the future so we set it up to be changeable in the future

439
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
um love to

440
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
uh will the set bonuses apply to an exalted item as an affix or it won't be like on set items

441
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:13,000
um the set bonus will apply just like every other set item set bonus applies um like it it is the set

442
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
item

443
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
oh my goodness

444
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
lagan is gonna squish me like a bug this isn't lagan's timeline

445
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
the emperor of course is gonna switch me like a bug

446
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
if i make it to him

447
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,000
okay

448
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
let's do more questions because we're now at seven pages okay we're gonna do this

449
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:09,000
this and uh is it this this this oh no what is it there we go oh it doesn't get rid of those

450
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
oh we already had ui scale stuff here there's more of it coming

451
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:29,000
uh enemies allies where is it minions there it is

452
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
bye bye ui oh my hump names are whatever we're gonna answer some questions i'm just looking at me

453
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
uh right now what will be inside season two will also be available in legacy yes is there any plans

454
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
to make specific mechanics that will only be inside a season that could be added to legacy

455
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
after the season yeah that's that is the sort of thing that we that we're open to and we've done

456
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,000
short-term versions of that with aberroth release originally last season um it's not something we're

457
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
explicitly saying yes or no to but it is something that we are interested if the if it makes sense

458
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
for the mechanic and we're kind of getting to the point we have enough content that it's not as big

459
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
of a deal to do that to something with with uh with legacy uh any plans to make the one-shot chest

460
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:21,000
item mod shards farmable no because you can't use them afterwards they're sealed anyways uh getting

461
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,000
unity to work uh in kubernetes cluster is magic all its own do you think you could do a back-end engineer

462
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:38,000
qa share in a future dev stream uh probably not uh but maybe toss that in the suggestions channel and

463
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,000
then i'll get to someone who knows uh able to decide that uh hey pets pick up gold when uh hey

464
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
pets pick up gold when hey looking good hyped for new patch yeah uh not season two i'll tell you that

465
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
much uh with champions set affixes other potential filtering options will there be more than 75 rules

466
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
available no we're not expanding the number of rules in the loot filter it'll still be 75 it's already a

467
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
stretch we did make a couple changes that will allow you to combine some rules that were multiple

468
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
rules in the past so you'll have access to a little bit more space uh if you were using some of

469
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
those rules before uh any primalist changes coming ever yes there's lots every patch uh to me it

470
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
feels like a class that's a melee sorcerer totem summoning minion summoning skill triggering class

471
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,000
no identity i i feel like beast masters has has a clear identity in the uh in their companions and

472
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,000
druid has their clear identity in their uh transformations um and then uh shaman struggles

473
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
a little bit to bring the the totem theming through um but it gets that elemental damage uh focus

474
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:45,000
from from just about everywhere that that that earth uh sorry physical with earth theming um

475
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
lightning weather and cold weather we try and keep it as like the nature weather theming for

476
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
for shaman there uh will we be able to get shards from the champion affixes uh yes no uh champion affixes are sealed no shards

477
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:07,000
yes champion affixes are sealed no shards um

478
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
uh i know this patch is focused on end game but did anything get changed in the campaign like area

479
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
tweaks or boss buffs yes um there's there's there's changes in the campaign not huge ones but there are

480
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
some changes here and they're sprinkled in um some of them are just like little mechanical things some of

481
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
them are adding a little bit of quality of life stuff some of them are just smoothing out the process a

482
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
little bit some of them are um the champions do appear in the campaign as well so there's an

483
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
extra added challenge there that makes things a little more interesting as well all right i prefer

484
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:45,000
to play offline uh for the fast af loading times is there any chance for online to have loading parity

485
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
with offline or is as fast as it's going to get already i mean we're always doing whatever we can to

486
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
improve the performance of online and get those loading times down as fast as we can

487
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,000
um i i don't see a world where it can be the same as offline i just don't see how it's possible

488
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:09,000
um i i i don't know enough about the uh the back end of how loading happens to know if that is possible

489
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
or not i want to say something that i noticed from every podcast you've been in and it's something

490
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
quite unique but your smile happiness whenever you talk about elise contagious and it's amazing thank

491
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
you very much appreciate that i'm probably smiling a little bit less right now because i'm talking so

492
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:31,000
much but uh i wanted to say something oh it's that uh will we be able to cast and move with wasd

493
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
controls if the ability is instant cast yes wasd does not give you any new functionality that you

494
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
don't have already so anything that you can do now you'll still be able to with wasd but it doesn't open

495
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:47,000
up new uh functionality for uh casting abilities if an ability has a cast duration which almost or the

496
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
vast majority of them do this still will with wasd uh will the nurse to ward generation and retention

497
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
can you give us any more details on the types of nodes that were hit um most of the ones that say

498
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,000
like that trigger on on hit on crit um things that are like uh there's there's some rings some some

499
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
set and unique rings that have like ward on hit or chance to ward on hit or ward on crit things like

500
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:18,000
that um lots of them are given more per hit or crit and a capped frequency or just one of those things

501
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:27,000
um last epoch on ps5 please i love last epoch i can't always fire up my pc yeah we'd love to come

502
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
to console we don't have any info on when uh or anything like that or which consoles it'll be or

503
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
anything like that but yeah that's that is something we're still we're still hopeful for

504
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
i'm still working on uh after season two what's the next top priority you'll be working on still

505
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
in game or something else um i think let's focus on season two for now and we can get into post season

506
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:55,000
two stuff later um i'm i've just yeah i've been working on something for post season two for a

507
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
while now that is going to be awesome but i don't know if it's the top priority uh probably not um

508
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:07,000
all right items are reworked yeah they are set shards so awesome the actual items themselves didn't

509
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
change much there were a couple items that we adjusted a little bit here and there while we were

510
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
going through and picking out which affix to put on each item um we we kind of were like oh this

511
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
this this could use a buffer oh maybe this can use a little change in what it's doing to make

512
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
it more thematic like there's a few minor changes that happen with a few sets but nothing major

513
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
oh you know what let's put something up on on screen because i'm just talking here and this

514
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:40,000
is boring to look at here we go there's something else um sorry if anyone asked before last time i

515
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
remember it being i could just make myself bigger too if you want to see that that's not a big deal

516
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
um remember being asked not entirely clear did the team get to improve further on controller support

517
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,000
oh yeah so the big thing controller uh the big issue controller has right now and i know i'm blocking

518
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
myself uh do i have projectile abilities i can show this off with you

519
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:10,000
no none of these are gonna work nice anyways okay so with with controller support

520
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
sorry i just shrink this over there with controller support

521
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
currently because my character is facing this direction if i use fireball fireball will fire in

522
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
that direction period so if i'm running in this direction i'm facing this direction and if i use

523
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
fireball while i'm running it will shoot forward um the new controller support because um

524
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
say there was say there was a mob over here and brownie face i'm angry little evil goatee

525
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:58,000
spiky spiky hair yeah that's enough um because there's an enemy over there because the context

526
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
is there's an enemy nearby if you are running this direction with controller and use fireball you'll

527
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
stop for a brief you would stop anyways for a brief moment turn around uh and shoot fireball in this

528
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
direction and then keep moving immediately afterwards so you get a proper stutter step with proper smart

529
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
targeting that happens because the context is there that this is the enemy you want to hit

530
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:24,000
um now we also have uh specialization specific targeting as well so uh if we can use ballista as

531
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:33,000
an example ballista has a node in its tree which says um like it if you're near it it gets a buff

532
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
i think is what the node is um so you want to cast ballista right beside you

533
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:48,000
my bad ballista um so you want to cast ballista directly beside you so that it gets the buff

534
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:55,000
but say you take the ballista node that says uh when it dies it explodes you actually want to put

535
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
that ballista near an enemy um so that's the specialization specific part of it so it's context

536
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
and specialization specific because it will um it will see hey there's an enemy over here and i've

537
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
taken the specialization that says i want to put it near enemies so i'm going to put it near enemies

538
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
even if you're facing this direction so there's context and specialization specific

539
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
targeting for every ability on controller um that wasn't there before

540
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,000
all right any new ancient era stuff in season two you would be my toddler's favorite person if you put a

541
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,000
new in new dinosaurs um i think technically there are new dinosaurs dinosaur

542
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
technically i can say yes but not really no i'm sorry not yet um ancient era stuff's gonna be the

543
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
focus of a future patch um yeah

544
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
uh learn to make filters in for game 1.0 is there anything that we need to have to do for our filters

545
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
with the new patch there's a couple things that you'll want to update with filters nothing nothing

546
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:04,000
gigantically mega different um but updating them will be useful because there's new types of items

547
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
there's a couple new things you can do with them uh stuff like that uh any plans to add new skills

548
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
for current classes or will those only come with a whole new class fingers crossed for new skills

549
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:20,000
straight from uh let's just straight from d3 um we will be adding new skills to existing classes

550
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,000
for example um d2 guided arrow pre-nerf is getting added into last epoch in the form of heart seeker

551
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:34,000
which is the one you skill this ability this this um the season for marksman um next season at least

552
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
lich will be getting one new melee skill um we haven't said anything else but that will be happening

553
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
there as well that's the plan currently you know everything can change uh but that's the current plan

554
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:52,000
i should do the boss or not uh was adding different class supporting mercenaries ever a consideration

555
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:01,000
absolutely yeah uh we've talked about a few there's there's a nod to mercenaries in the game there's a

556
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
relic that you can get that gives you a crossbow mercenary that's kind of a nod to that um i'd still

557
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
love to do i still love to have like a class that that's the thing is they have a mercenary and they

558
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
build it out now the um the the forge guards manifest armor kind of plays that role a little

559
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
bit because you can summon it gets a copy of gear things like that but it's not quite the same

560
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,000
need more water why is my camera auto focusing thought i turned that off

561
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:45,000
okay uh was adding different class supporting or instead uh gosh

562
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
this is not gonna go well

563
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
i shouldn't be doing this because i need to answer questions but i like fighting this boss

564
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,000
times that one i'm half an hour behind oh no okay can the set shards only be used on those item types

565
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
the set was or can it be used last bear's fury used on boots or helmet no the uh base item type must

566
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
remain the same um the base base item category must remain the same um so you may put the last bear's

567
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
fury the gloves make sure that right the gloves can go on any gloves um

568
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:34,000
um they do uh they do cause uh class requirements to be taken into account so uh you can't create a

569
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:42,000
conflicting class requirement um so if it is a specific class required helmet uh it like if the if

570
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
the affix would create it to be class required uh you can't put it on a class requirement helmet of a

571
01:00:47,000 --> 01:01:01,000
different class because you can't have conflicting requirements um

572
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
your berserk run here we go

573
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:29,000
come on yeah that's the same icon that's what same working for aldrez uh oh yeah leech we'll do leech

574
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,000
uh any changes coming to characters being stuck when walking into slash through enemies and

575
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
i don't know

576
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:47,000
um i don't know i'm sorry that'll be in the patch notes if it is off the top of my head i do not

577
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
remember i'm sorry uh right thoughts on higher monster density i think that in certain situations

578
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
it is awesome and very much uh interested in doing it uh there's some there's some fairly high monster

579
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
density in a few situations in some tombs that you'll you'll see um has an option to increase

580
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
cursor size been added yet so yola mass isn't required no unfortunately we do not have the

581
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
functionality available to us to do that um once we are able to do it we will but uh there's no

582
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
sign of it happening anytime soon i apologize it is something that we are very interested in but

583
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
it's just not it's not like oh we just don't feel like doing it or we don't want to do it it's a

584
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
it just doesn't work right now

585
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:32,000
uh can we still upgrade normal affixes after we turn a rare exalted item into a set piece yes

586
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
um so reforge set items can still be crafted like regular items um it's kind of required to be

587
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
able to put multiple set items set set tiers of the same set affix on so you'll still want to be

588
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,000
um ramping that up to five or using runes in order to shuffle exalted around to get it into seven

589
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
uh any thoughts to making the ui editable yeah would be great

590
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:05,000
um move move stuff around if the answer is no is there a reason for it uh it is it's it's a

591
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,000
it would be nice to do uh and i think once we're done doing more standard updates to the ui that's

592
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
something we'll we'll try to to look forward to look towards um but we just don't have the bandwidth

593
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
to do it right now there's more important things to be doing in ui work at the moment

594
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
all right are we getting overleach or something cool like that uh

595
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
i don't i don't think so

596
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
oh this is one of those things it was it was a topic like a while ago almost happened

597
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,000
and i don't think it did

598
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:54,000
okay we're gonna take a little bit of break from gameplay and uh just crush through some more

599
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:01,000
questions because i'm so far behind still and uh so here's a node from the weaver tree to chew on

600
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,000
while i'm doing this um so this is uh an example of one of the styles of nodes that can appear in the

601
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
weaver tree so just getting a little more info there there's there's lots of nodes in there um

602
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
and this is an example of one of those styles

603
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,000
okay

604
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
uh i wanted to hop on my character to play around some but it's been moved to standard

605
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
and we can't wear half our items anymore because i don't have the cof any thoughts

606
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
um intentionals or an oversight yes so when you go to your stash there's a button on the top right

607
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
that lets you merge your stash contents which includes your uh faction ranks so click that

608
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and you'll be able to use them no problem um i think the oversight is not making that obvious

609
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
enough i think it may have told you in like a pop-up but it's like it's one of those pop-ups

610
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
like stuff's moved to legacy and then you just like you're like okay uh and it it gets glossed

611
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
over or it wasn't in there at all one of the two

612
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,000
uh hey hey just curious about what we can expect from the central rework and what made you guys decide to

613
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
do so the biggest thing is that the cat there's a lot more um we went into this pretty in depth

614
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:20,000
recently on um on gazzy's podcast that we did so deep more details there i think um but as for like

615
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:27,000
what brought up this about was i mean you go look at the the current characters the current sentinels

616
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
that are being played and like the use of volatile reversal is like 99 for anything that's even remotely

617
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,000
competitive because it just did so so so much work but we were getting a lot of feedback people

618
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
didn't really like playing with it that much and it was just one of those things where they're like

619
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
trying to mitigate the bad play patterns that it has while just getting the most benefit out of it

620
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,000
it was just this like buff button that's kind of janky um so we wanted to turn it into a fun to use

621
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
ability that you were taking because you like the functionality and it was also powerful not that you

622
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
were taking because it buffed other things and because it was so far reaching it affected every

623
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
other ability in uh sentinel and so they all needed a huge some of them just number changes but some of

624
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:18,000
them functionality changes and um it caused a bit of a knock-on effect and we reworked like sigils is now

625
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:25,000
symbols and um there's there's some updates there as well to make less less busy work we're kind of

626
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
we're targeting the like the the fit and finish the play the feel that stuff a lot while um we'll

627
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,000
also try to make it a little bit stronger especially in game stuff uh hey mike i was wondering what's

628
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
your take uh what's your take about preparation time activities between echoes to specify a little

629
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
bit my question currently there are currently no break between echoes aside from crafting

630
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
which is quite light once end game is reached for example for me i like to blast for a couple hours

631
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
then having some kind of 15 to 30 minute break juicing content changing activities crafting yeah i think

632
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,000
we're we're starting to get a little bit more of that and i think there's there's there's a point

633
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
where that's there's like too much of that that we're trying to be careful about approaching too

634
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,000
quickly um but we're pretty far away from that still and um we're starting to get a little bit more

635
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:19,000
of that with the a little a few more options uh in crafting um and a little few more options in

636
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
planning with the the new uh woven echoes that's going to the monolith system so we're we're

637
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
i'd say we're leaning a little bit towards a little bit more of that but not a ton

638
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
all right have you touched upon loot dropping off screen it's difficult to play dot and turret builds

639
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
um nothing specific really to share uh

640
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:47,000
oh i miss peasant dev peasant dev you subbed like 20 minutes ago i apologize thank you very much um

641
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:56,000
um as far as loot dropping off screen there's we are trying to address some instances of uh of loot

642
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,000
being missed in certain situations um but i don't have anything specific for like minions killing

643
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,000
stuff off screen right now for you uh do you fix the memory leak on scene change as far as i know there

644
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,000
are no current memory leaks in the uh development builds that are being used to prepare for season

645
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:25,000
two um i haven't personally experienced a memory leak in years um so i i i don't know if the specific

646
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
one you're talking about that was happening for you has uh been changed or not but as far as i'm

647
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:37,000
aware there are no active memory leaks in uh in the builds that we are testing uh do you at ishi plans

648
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,000
to come to gamescom and columbia game this year i don't think we are i would love to it was that was

649
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:50,000
i that was one of the most fun times i've had doing anything um i don't think we're coming um

650
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
because i haven't heard anything about it yet i feel like we were already planning it this far out last time

651
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
uh we talked about an epoch con some time ago jokingly when can we come and visit you well we're so

652
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:05,000
spread out that we use conventions as kind of like a meetup for the team um but i i'd love to

653
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:12,000
i'd love to i just want to do more conventions in general there's so much fun exhausting so much fun

654
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
uh how many people do you have working at each at the moment i don't know it is a triple digit

655
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:25,000
number a low triple digit number uh it it changes there's it's also it's tricky to nail down as well

656
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
because you have people who are like a company gets contracted in to come do a specific thing

657
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
now they might be contracted for like four years and they feel like part of the team they basically

658
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,000
are part of the team but technically aren't um so like they're or they're part of the team but not

659
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:48,000
working for 11th hour games they're contracted to work with us so it's um it's tricky to define

660
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
sometimes the exact number of people but the number of people that are like their day jobs is working on

661
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
last epoch it's a low triple digit number uh will you guys one day add falcon skins oh yes

662
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
oh yes if like of the i think the fastest selling cosmetic we could possibly make would be like a

663
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:13,000
phoenix falcon skin like that would just be like 100 adoption day one all right

664
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,000
uh hey mike can't wait for season start any chance the running all over the screen when surfing through

665
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
years uh surfing through your stash has been addressed uh yeah there's that's that was

666
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
something we were looking at recently uh how do you feel about not having a sense of completion on

667
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:39,000
last epoch's end game sometimes gonna catch them all maps something how do you feel about not having a

668
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:46,000
sense of completion on last epoch's end game something like a gonna catch them all like maps but for monoliths

669
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:52,000
like like like like having having something like this where it like talks about the monoliths completion

670
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
um or like

671
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,000
uh

672
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
i think i think they're having having like an achievement system would be really good for this

673
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,000
and we don't have that right now and yes kane i know it's still open see i can see you typing

674
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:23,000
all right ellie is my favorite aribg and i will definitely be buying new supporter packs

675
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
uh to support you guys however i do think cosmetics will be improved is there a consent

676
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
consensus consensus effort to improve them yes

677
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:41,000
oh uh we i uh okay look going back a little bit the weaver i was i was wrong it was cheeky

678
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
and i can't just tell me something else uh the weaver the weaver echoes do track your completion

679
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:53,000
for the weaver maps so there is that which is great um the new the new supporter packs the new

680
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
cosmetics in general i think that the the art team has really stepped up their game for these ones

681
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:05,000
uh some of them are kind of like oh my god really it's that good um so yeah i i'm excited to show

682
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:13,000
those off uh hey mike is it possible that minions persist between game sessions uh like when i exit le

683
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:19,000
i have minions last time i get auto summoned i maybe season two won't have it i'm sorry

684
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
all right control scroll wheel to navigate stash tabs that's a good idea

685
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
go put that in the suggestion channel it is not currently like that

686
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
all right would druid get some changes in season two or is it more next season thing

687
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
um i mean like every class gets changes to every season so yes and yes

688
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
oh fandom grip it's cool ring

689
01:12:51,000 --> 01:13:00,000
if i can pick it up which there's improvements coming to that we just did yesterday all right

690
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
uh is there any plans to have skill icons on your board change color depending on what damage type

691
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,000
they do red for physical green for poison etc um we don't that's something that we've talked about

692
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
that we're like yeah we should really do that we should do that yeah yeah okay let's do that and uh

693
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
gotta find time to do that

694
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:29,000
in the past we've been hesitant to do it but i think we're coming around at least i have doesn't mean much

695
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
all right do you have plans to revamp the skill system no we love the skill system as it stands now

696
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
at least the number of specialization skills is limited since the ui can only show about four or

697
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,000
five um yeah it's it's the the the limit is not because the ui is set up that way the ui is set up

698
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:55,000
that way because of the limit um and we really enjoy that limit uh how expensive is it to make the 3d

699
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
models for items i don't know but it's i know it takes longer than what it costs to make the

700
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:07,000
functionality for them um what about infinite forging potential items something you can craft perfectly with

701
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
long enough time invested we're not interested in doing that we've actually been very careful not

702
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:17,000
to introduce those but yeah you know everything has the possibility nothing's set in stone forever

703
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
but uh unless something changes we we don't have plans for that at the moment

704
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:36,000
excuse me our reforge items not sure if that's official name yep perfect

705
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
classed as items or rare items can you slam them into unique with lp for example they are

706
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:48,000
kind of halfway between both so they are uh rare items in the sense that you can still craft on them

707
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
but they are set items in the sense that you cannot slam them onto legendaries

708
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
until you need to make a legendary with them

709
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and there's other systems too that kind of rely on them not really being either and it treats them a

710
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:11,000
little bit differently i'll actually show you one of those in like 10 minutes i'll explain what i'm

711
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
talking about yeah

712
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:24,000
we'll come back to that uh will there be changes to timeline blessings or timelines area options um

713
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
there's there's some minor changes to some blessings but for the most part that's

714
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:37,000
pretty similar um like like there's some some some number scaling a few new a few new ones that were

715
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
in some and some got removed from some you know like some minor little things but no no big changes

716
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
no systematic changes there

717
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:50,000
uh hello mike happy friday happy friday glad to be here having fun this is a question heavy stream and

718
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
they are good questions today you guys are doing a great job so keep it up

719
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,000
um thank you very much for the sub like oh like rainy party welcome stay a while and listen or

720
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
talk you know whatever you want to do chatting is good um hello mike happy friday with the reduction

721
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
in dot we take an end game will there also be any changes to how much damage reduction we can get

722
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,000
four dots like on a passive unit items there's a little bit i think somewhere but not really it's

723
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
pretty it's pretty scarce still we didn't the reason we're doing this is because we don't want to put

724
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
uh too much more pressure on the other systems because we could have just put it in those places

725
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
in general but we want to keep we don't want this to be adding too much of a new defensive layer that

726
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
you're required to heavily invest in as much which is why we're doing it globally

727
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,000
oh well we're at 145 times so it's we are a little over half an hour behind in questions so i'm if you're

728
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
not if you're not seeing me answer your current questions because i'm half hour behind all right

729
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:50,000
will there be an uber avaroth race love the last one i really hope so um keep an eye on the news

730
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
uh with the addition of heart seeker uh have other skills been updated to add interactions for it

731
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
um it's more that heart seeker got interactions with other skills the because the style of ability

732
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,000
it is it doesn't fit great to be triggered by other things but it does well triggering other things

733
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
um so like for example it can trigger puncture um and it has it has a couple little integrations

734
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:23,000
here and there but not heavy heavy brogue's a tricky one with that in general uh all right

735
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
there's a couple items i think how about we have a new community item event a set created by the

736
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
community that would be really cool it'd be really cool um wouldn't be for season two

737
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,000
uh is fissure going to finally convert with smite conversions

738
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
oh i want to go check this so bad i think so i think it did

739
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
i do not remember

740
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
i'm pretty sure there's a wait wait for patch notes on that one sorry

741
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,000
all right if arena champions will be there oh um

742
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
speaking of arena champions will there be a way to target farm a specific boss instead of

743
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,000
keep retrying the arena over and over hopes of getting one specific arena boss um i don't i

744
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
these are good questions and i don't know the answers all of them i'm i want to say that there

745
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
might be a weaver tree node that that affects this or if they're not that's where i would put it

746
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
maybe that's the thing for a future patch for weaver nodes if it's not there yet

747
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
that's that's the sort of thing that would fit really well in a weaver tree node

748
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
uh is there going to be a battle pass type of things on the season always love that grind kind

749
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:03,000
of stuff um it's the style of thing that i think can be done well i think there's uh you know like

750
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:11,000
like a season's journey um and like depends on how you depends on how you frame it and present it

751
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and uh depends on like if there's if there are paid versions of it uh like depending like really

752
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
strictly that you can't buy um more power in those sort of things you know like there's

753
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
there's there's a whole minefield of of all sorts of issues but i think that it does

754
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:34,000
give more than it takes um so it's something that i'd be interested in doing um but we don't have any

755
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:45,000
for season two uh anton eight and i always have to check a little squint a little bit thank you very

756
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,000
much for the sub that is that is 21 months we're getting close to two years there that is that's so

757
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
cool you see these huge numbers that pop up there's a 47 a 46 it's just wild so i really appreciate you

758
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:03,000
guys thank you um will there be improvements to bizarre price check less npcs not yet uh price

759
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:09,000
checks one of those things that is um you know it's like if we could wave a magic wand and it goes in the

760
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:16,000
game it would be in the game uh it's not something that we have the access to at the moment i apologize for that one

761
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,000
uh right will we be able to somehow use singularity unique idol at last please i mean you can yeah

762
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,000
like just will it be strong enough to use uh you'll have to find that out yourself i don't know if it's uh

763
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
like you can definitely use it already but i understand the sentiment being that the build

764
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
this builds that aren't strong enough to go with it uh will every class can use any skill

765
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:49,000
will every class can use any skill no uh like using outside the class no it is a strongly classed

766
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
game uh unequipping a weaver's will item and the way it unallocates the skill points is highly

767
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,000
frustrating as it can pull points from other allocated skills uh is this by design or are there

768
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:09,000
any changes to the way this works um it is by design um you can preempt it if you want by pulling

769
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
four points out and then re-leveling it those four points first uh forcing it to do the specific ones

770
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:22,000
you want which i know is not really the same thing um but it is it is it's not random it is specific

771
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:28,000
i know you didn't say random but it is uh not something that we're planning on changing right now

772
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
all right is mike on live or is this season two this is the live version of the game this is not

773
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:43,000
season two right now i'm sorry yeah after after carve went rogue last time i was given strict

774
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:50,000
instructions i had to delete it off my knife i wanted to focus on being able to answer questions and uh

775
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,000
worrying about if i was showing uh leaking anything extra was not worth the stress for me

776
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
but you know i think it is time for

777
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:04,000
i think it's time to show this one that i'm excited for

778
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
nope come on mike figure

779
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,000
there we go that's what i want to do okay so these nodes that we've that you in the trailer you can see

780
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:36,000
yeah kane sounds good um we're gonna stop taking questions at in seven minutes

781
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:43,000
or in 17 minutes so at 20 minutes before the stream ends um in 17 minutes from now we are going

782
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
to stop taking new questions so if you want to get a question to be answered because i have

783
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
seven pages of questions still to answer here uh we're gonna stop taking new questions and i'm

784
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
gonna try and barrel through these as fast as possible and i do apologize that i'm not gonna

785
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
get through them all i'll go a little over time probably um yeah so this is a node in the weaver's

786
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
tree um that when you when you put a point in the node so you put one point in uh in this node right

787
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:12,000
here and this slot up here opens up becomes unlocked you can then place any weapon or jewelry i think

788
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,000
yep that's the weapon or jewelry slot um you can place any weapon or jewelry in that slot

789
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,000
and whoa heavy 10 gifted subs the channel thank you very much that is that's congrats everyone got one

790
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:29,000
of those that's great thank you um yeah this is sweet this is this is this is really hype so it um

791
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:36,000
will then drop items that are similar to the item you imprint in the slot so when when i say you place

792
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:43,000
the item in the slot you um you put it in the slot but it doesn't it doesn't it's not removed from your

793
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:50,000
inventory so you have to keep the item in your inventory and uh it just takes a snapshot of what that item looks like

794
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
at that time so you can you you can put the item you can imprint the item into the tree

795
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
it takes a snapshot of the item you can craft on it some more if you want you can break the item you

796
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:07,000
can forge it onto something doesn't matter um the imprint stays where it is and uh and then

797
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
you get a chance to drop similar items to it thus specializing the type of gear you're finding so

798
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
you can be like i really want to find items like this item basically um so i was mentioning earlier

799
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:24,000
about set items if you put a reforge set item in this slot um it will most of the time

800
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,000
uh most of the time it will treat it like as as this as though that set affix just didn't exist

801
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,000
um and it'll just it'll just chaos that set affix instead um but sometimes it'll also treat it as the

802
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:45,000
set item the base set item so this doesn't let you duplicate reforge set items to get more set shards

803
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,000
super super quickly um but it does uh it does work with set that shard items reforge set items as

804
01:24:51,000 --> 01:25:00,000
well well okay more questions let's go well this is all this is up there uh have you played the poe

805
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:06,000
freesia league uh and is there anything you would want to add from that into le i've been way too busy

806
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:16,000
haven't touched it yet at all um i don't think i will this time but maybe we'll see i do really like

807
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:23,000
it just so busy right now uh any plans on raising the minimum skill level i feel you hit max level

808
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,000
too early and then you lose big driving factor for motivation uh not for season two uh any is there

809
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,000
any plans during season two or after season two for more of a push for clan guild-esque system yeah

810
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
i think post season two there's a bit more of a push for a clan guild-esque system uh one thing to

811
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:47,000
be clear on this it wouldn't almost certainly not include a guild stash um or if it did it would be

812
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:53,000
regular trade rules for it uh last epoch i remember a bit back uh there was a reddit thread asking for

813
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:58,000
feedback on pet builds did this influence forge master forge guard i assume changes and what

814
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
takeaways came from that feedback oh i'm sure it influenced it i do not remember what got taken

815
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:14,000
specifically from it another sub uh vi gapped i put this capitalization that makes it easier to read

816
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:21,000
but thank you very much the sub ah vega pt yeah see there's there's capitalization that gets stripped

817
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:27,000
when it goes into the notifications window all right thank you very much

818
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:37,000
uh i know that the game works on photo proton uh will there be any plans to develop a native linux

819
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
version i know it was dropped a long time ago i don't know what the status of this is i really hope

820
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:48,000
so but uh i think it's basically just whichever one works the best hey rhymer thanks for highlighting

821
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,000
that one there hey bud hi glad to hear from you hope you're doing great

822
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:05,000
uh there was there was separate stories at start for each character yeah the intro intro videos um

823
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:12,000
completely shifted out or there'll be something in future like an act zero um i think i'd like to see

824
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
more videos like that tied to like side things you could investigate where you could like find like

825
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
a lore tidbit and it would like show up if you wanted it like you went to hunt those things you

826
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
could find them um they just didn't play with how we reworked the start of the game

827
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,000
any plans to have an have experience gained on max level characters be rewarding i mean it's like

828
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
one of the most rewarding things you can get at endgame so probably no more than it is already

829
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
uh not in the form of power creep maybe crafting mats gold gear could be endgame blessing tree

830
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:46,000
possibility um i mean it's what generates favor so uh you want as much as you can right now i don't i

831
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:53,000
don't think we're adding it in a second secondary scaling system uh will be element attack immune to

832
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:01,000
mobs will be element attack immune to mobs or always capped at 75 basically will mobs be some immune to

833
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
some elements like fire dragon should be immune to fire as an example i understand what you're talking

834
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
about yes we're adding more of this stuff uh some champions you'll see will show up and they'll be

835
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
like extremely resistant to fire that sort of thing it'll stay on them and they'll be like a fire

836
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
themed mob and that sort of stuff so yeah we are we're adding a little bit more of this on uh really

837
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:27,000
specific situations but just walking into endgame and zombies immune to cold and a goblins immune to fire

838
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
um is is not something we're interested in doing

839
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:43,000
uh where was uh any chance of getting the tab priority function work for whole categories

840
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
so you know to make separate rule for each of the tabs in the category

841
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:57,000
tab priority function oh i see what you're saying in the stash yes um oh that's a cool idea i don't

842
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:04,000
think we've we've we've tried that so not for season two uh did you guys remove the lagon safe spot i

843
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:12,000
sure hope so i don't know i don't actually know i would assume so if not i'll i'll i'll try and look

844
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:19,000
for that in hotfix i wish affix cards auto picked up when you walked over them especially with all the

845
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
ground effects you have to dodge in this game not unusual feedback it's not something we're planning for

846
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,000
season two uh is there any plans to allow casting and moving with wasd not specifically um

847
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,000
it it's something that we might consider um yeah so the rest of the question is spells locking you

848
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,000
with was he feels really clunky and for the most part defeats the purpose we we there was no way we

849
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:49,000
could have done that for season two that just there's no way um with when we decided to put it in and when

850
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:55,000
season two was scheduled to launch there was having that functionality to change to every single skill

851
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:03,000
at that point development was uh a fool's errand um it we would it would require us reworking the casting

852
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and functionality of every single ability and so so many nodes that affect the functionality there as

853
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
well that it's it's um we'd have to be really 100 certain that we wanted to do because it is

854
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
every ability that's been created in the game has been created with this understanding that that's not a

855
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:30,000
thing you can do um and adding that in now is such a mammoth change that it's uh daunting to say the

856
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:36,000
least all right uh hey mike i'm really thrilled with the play the new season i understood uh class

857
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
specific idols will be craftable is this the case yes you say yes i want my adorned aftershock idols

858
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:47,000
unless my aftershock wearbear will be stronger yes um class specific idols are the only idols that are

859
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:56,000
enchantable i'm like sorry if this has been asked recently that's quite all right but is there any

860
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,000
new info on the ability to select specific uniques with the loot filter the current requirement level

861
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:08,000
base is very limiting um i thought it this is where i'm like i didn't do that already

862
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
i guess i guess obviously doesn't

863
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
maybe i'm thinking of uh

864
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,000
i might be thinking of um in the in the in the in the bizarre

865
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
i can picture a list of picking and picking uniques out of a list i might be picturing the

866
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:41,000
bizarre list i'm sorry 50 50 on that one um i hope so i'm back to making the same question

867
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:47,000
lol mocks at 200 hoped hopped on my game server months ago and said i'm down for dragon class

868
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,000
uh you guys want to actually play a dragon yes uh is this something you guys talked about since then

869
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
and yes i still have the proof yeah keep that proof hold on to it

870
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:05,000
um i i don't have any info on potential upcoming classes in the future anything like that

871
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:12,000
um i would love to i think it's super cool um yeah i think there's i think there's clear precedent

872
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,000
for this being just fun you know and we love adding fun things to the game so uh who knows what the future

873
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:25,000
will bring but i i keep pushing for it because i'd love to see it uh how much of a dps boost

874
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:32,000
uh just having a nice beer to give you it's it's more of a defensive boost than anything it's some

875
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
extra padding

876
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:44,000
okay there's the there's the still 33 minutes behind mark oof uh will we be able to filter by

877
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,000
roles within the range of a tier for an affix or any way to filter within a specific unique uh

878
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:57,000
uh i should have looked up you know i will look up filter changes for either tries or aaron's podcast

879
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,000
and uh we will uh we'll get some more details on filter specifics for those

880
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
um or maybe i'll see if i can find them out for next week but i don't i don't know the details of

881
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
what's changed for filters well enough to talk about them right now i'm sorry i didn't work on that this

882
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:19,000
patch a quick question about heart seeker will only the first arrow have a chance to inflict

883
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
ailments or can each subsequent hit inflict ailments each hit can still inflict ailments just the same

884
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:33,000
as the first one um it goes nutty uh any plans to change stash tabs reset feels so much worse to buy

885
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:39,000
dozens of them every time than permitted paid stash tabs in the permanent paid stash tabs in poe

886
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
we're we're not currently interested in having uh a paid system for this what i'd really like to see

887
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
is a this is not something season two but something that i will be pushing for um i think it's getting

888
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:57,000
suggested enough that it's a possibility is a um a template where you can as you buy new tabs it'll

889
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
be like auto add to the template and it'll just like auto pick the next one in in your list of templated

890
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
tabs and it'll just populate as you buy them

891
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:14,000
um since symbols of hope was shown could you show how the legendary ring related to his sigils is now

892
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
also how does idle with sigils duration change um

893
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:28,000
i don't know how the idol changed the the ring is still it's basically it's the same thematics but just

894
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
going about it a different way so it uh it's more auto casting i think it changes the interval between

895
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:42,000
auto casts um and increased effect or something like that it's it's like the two nodes that don't

896
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
make any sense in that ring anymore the two mods on that ring that don't make any sense anymore are

897
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:53,000
just like tweaked versions of the same thing um i can't remember exactly how they were cheap tweet but

898
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:59,000
it's it's it's it's more conditional infrequent automation just like the ring was before

899
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:09,000
all right do you have any plans for blade dancer in the future yep uh not huge changes i think it's on

900
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:15,000
the list for a new ability um i think it's still missing one

901
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
i'd love to see a little a little a little touch of two-handed support in there that's my that's my

902
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:32,000
dream there uh can we see any changes to the visual cap for debuffs like bleed or poison some builds

903
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
uh canon will go above a thousand stacks and right now we can't see if any change

904
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
to the build has made a difference um

905
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,000
i don't think we've changed that i think it's i think that's more of a like why why have we let

906
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
a thousand stacks of something go up more than anything else but um

907
01:35:50,000 --> 01:36:00,000
maybe i think that was done we're like no one can get above a thousand uh so maybe

908
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
putting it to four digits probably wouldn't it wouldn't break anything horribly i'm pretty sure

909
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
it's just like the ui is just it doesn't look great at four digits so we just capped it at three

910
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:18,000
type thing uh all right any plans for fourth mastery for regular classes yes not in season two uh what will

911
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:23,000
happen to double health stout idols in my stash once the patch hits and double health affix is no

912
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:30,000
longer possible one of the flat added health on that will change to a different affix i don't

913
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
know if it's health regen or stun avoidance or something like that like it's a different similar

914
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
themed affix but it'll change

915
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
a new character stats ui when i remember you mentioning it being worked on no eta but yes it

916
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:52,000
is still being worked on slowly very slowly uh hey mike it's already been mentioned that the new

917
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,000
weaver stuff interacts with cof is the only cof rank perks or is that there are also some added

918
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:03,000
synergy with prophecies too it's that like when the weaver drops items when when the weaver's

919
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
will tree drops items like for example with the node that i'm showing right there

920
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:15,000
that one um the if you have something on your uh circle of fortune that interacts with drops it

921
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
interacts with those new drops as well so if it's like you get more drops you get more drops

922
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,000
uh old volatile reversal was fun with a lot of skill expression but it wasn't a buff wasn't a buff button

923
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:59,000
yes is there any plans to bring back old vr in some other form

924
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
the i would say the new vr has room to play the way you want it to play um

925
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
there's there's room for the new vr to to have a high skill ceiling and how you play with it

926
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:24,000
uh all right any plans to allow arena from okay we're cutting off questions uh so no new questions

927
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,000
so if you you you have like uh if you have like 10 seconds to slap any new questions you want in

928
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000
here um but other than that we're going to stop taking questions here so i can just try and get

929
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:43,000
through most of these um one that just got posted that doesn't have a tag that i just answered

930
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:52,000
uh all right uh any plans to allow arena from level one as an alternate level in quick action

931
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:01,000
not really no uh aspiring game deliver what skills do i need to build work to build to work for ehg um

932
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
it depends like we've gotten to the point now where you need to be fairly specialized

933
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:17,000
um in a specific field to to to work at ehg um so getting uh really good at a specific skill would be

934
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:25,000
my would be my advice um a general like all around dev is something we do higher um but usually you need

935
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:32,000
a fair bit of experience now to uh to have a shot because even when we post like not senior roles we get

936
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:38,000
people applying that have so much experience and it's unbelievable how good these people are is crazy

937
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:43,000
um there's there's there's been some some people have done interviews that i'm like

938
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:53,000
how how can we only hire one of these people i think um so yeah it's it's quite competitive um which is

939
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
great and it's uh

940
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:04,000
uh i i would say yeah pick pick us pick a specialty and and try and focus on that um

941
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
and if you if you're completely if you're working on projects try and complete projects

942
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
um if someone's like i've got these six different prototypes that each do something cool that i want

943
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,000
to show you i'm like someone's like here's a link to a game i released i'm like oh cool let me look at

944
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:26,000
that so yeah my two pieces of advice uh different take on the stash tabs is there any way to change

945
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:33,000
the price for different factions uh because you can change factions it doesn't really work great

946
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:40,000
because you could just build up on one switch and then buy them all um yeah you mentioned tagging them

947
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,000
as well so only using that faction again the complexity is a little high for i don't think that

948
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:51,000
the cost is for what most people are using are in in almost all situations there's some outlying

949
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,000
exceptions here but in almost every situation i think the cost is low enough that um reasonably

950
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:03,000
playing cof there's not really a big need to have 200 stash tabs and and if you are playing to the

951
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
point where you're getting that need you've got the gold for it anyways so uh

952
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:17,000
i i it's not something we're currently looking at very hard uh there's a lot of empty space in the

953
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
character creation screen are there any new base classes cooking behind the scenes are all the devs

954
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:29,000
working on refining and adding current class masteries um the like the big thing with a class

955
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,000
pipeline there's there's two main categories in the class pipelines it's the like the the art side of

956
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,000
things so the visuals the animations the models all that sort of stuff um and then there's the like

957
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
the functionality stuff where like the skills and all that sort of stuff i can tell you i because i

958
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:48,000
work on the skills side of things um there's no work actively being done on new classes for

959
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
uh for new master like new skills for new masteries right now where we are still focusing on existing

960
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,000
ones and new or new classes um but that doesn't mean focus can't change

961
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:07,000
all right hi mike will will be the glitch during the lagoon fight when the tentacle blocks the

962
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
minions companions other players outside fixed for the new season i i sure hope so um

963
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
you may you may i i don't know i have the last time i tried it

964
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
uh was last time i fought lagoon was on live last several times i fought lagoon was on live actually

965
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
at least with a pet i've been playing a lot of marxon so it doesn't matter

966
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,000
uh heart secret is great any chance we can get a tool tips added to minion abilities

967
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,000
lets us know what it scales off of and the internal cooldowns for these moves um

968
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
uh i'll tell you this they they they don't scale off attributes the they get the stats from the

969
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:57,000
minion themselves so you don't worry about the attribute scaling um as far as getting cooldowns and

970
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
stuff some of them have that if you hold alt on the nodes that they're affected by some of them

971
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
get that actually uh like this oh

972
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
people should i agree let's do that let's get it done

973
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
uh i was really hoping that would just show the tool tip there if i held if i held all there didn't

974
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
do it played myself uh do you consider the possible i'd love to i think do you consider the

975
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,000
possibility to end prophecies manually outside of the monos to not skip slash lose drops we've got

976
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
something for this

977
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:43,000
all right check it out here's some here's some gameplay playing playing the new heart seeker build

978
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
he's been off a little too much that he can chew oh no he's formed he's going he's can he survive he

979
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,000
he's pulling out oh he died look at all that great gear on the ground he's lost it all it's just gone he died

980
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
oh wait never mind it's fine there it is all good

981
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
yay um

982
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:17,000
so we're we're not uh we're not completely fixing the problem yet um but we're we're putting a band-aid on it

983
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,000
uh this is actually pretty sweet it works it works it works well uh it handles most of the really

984
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:32,000
pain point situations um but it is uh it's it's not i the question is specifically asking about prophecies

985
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:38,000
and huge huge drops and all sorts of stuff um so it doesn't quite fix the problem because um

986
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
you know you kind of what you have to do is hide all the all the tags of the prophecies

987
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,000
issues so we are going to keep looking at that it's still something we're keeping an eye on

988
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
um here i'll see if i can restart it somehow can i do this if i

989
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:57,000
show it again um there's also another leak in there too if you find it but

990
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:03,000
uh would you guys ever add pre-made basic loot filters yeah uh this is something that i would

991
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,000
love to do um i i really want it this is i i keep i keep mentioning this and talking about i really want

992
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:18,000
to add a loot filter um like share like share and sort search share and sort search share and sort

993
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:25,000
yeah uh functionality to that in game so you can just like find ones that other people have made in

994
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
the community because frankly the community made ones always end up being better than the dev made ones

995
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:37,000
in just about every game situation like this so um yeah i i'd i think having uh in-game sharing

996
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:44,000
system for them would be the ideal way to do it ways off from that though uh hey mike any teasers today

997
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:49,000
or in later streams for the remaining sentinel skill buffs uh we can talk about i think i think i put a

998
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,000
little bit of stuff in here today but not much we can uh we can we can play some other stuff later

999
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
i think i've shown all of the teasers for this one now

1000
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
just gonna

1001
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:26,000
there you go there's there's there's a bunch of stuff on screen while i finish these questions

1002
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000
we've got 15 minutes left and i'm gonna try and power through these last only three pages three

1003
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:36,000
pages only of questions we have we have stopped taking new questions from from chat i apologize

1004
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:42,000
um just because we are flooded with awesome questions um and i don't want to be here till midnight

1005
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,000
um but i am really enjoying this right now because you guys have great questions today

1006
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:50,000
uh

1007
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:59,000
any plans to add branches to existing skill trees yes um not in season two so much apart from some select

1008
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:06,000
skills um are there any new forms of meta progression for players who'd like to play

1009
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:11,000
exclusively hardcore kind of like a roguelike um i mean yeah the uh the weaver tree progression

1010
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:18,000
is a huge part of this of this patch um it's it's a huge meta progression system that's tons of fun

1011
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
and lets you customize your end game experience um there's lots of drops lots of changes in the

1012
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,000
content you're gonna be playing with it uh you'll you'll progress as you go through and get higher

1013
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
tier woven echoes as well so like you'll notice the ui for the woven echoes is broken up into four

1014
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
columns the ones on the right are much rarer and much harder to get and are much harder to

1015
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:43,000
complete much better rewards as well um and so you'll be uh progressing through those as you get

1016
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
more of them and get farther into it i would call that a meta progression because you can use them

1017
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
on multiple characters as well those are shared the echoes the woven echoes are shared in your stash so

1018
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
like they're not they're not physically located in your stash when we say shared in your stash

1019
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
it's that all characters that share a stash have access to the same ones

1020
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:09,000
um that was a raining party i missed thank you very much appreciate y'all uh would you love seeing

1021
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
would you really love seeing ui mtx's like different designs and themes uh this is something we've gone

1022
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:23,000
back and forth on so many times uh i'm currently on the side of yes i would love to see that um

1023
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:32,000
um do i think it's gonna happen anytime soon probably not uh love your loot filter creator any

1024
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:38,000
uh any improvements coming its way label size sound effects mini map icons you not much there's

1025
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:44,000
some little things you can uh you can change the size of all of the labels on the ground with the ui

1026
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
scaling because it is a global ui scaling i'd love to get that split out but right now it is all all

1027
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:56,000
together all right hi can you add dps meter so the puppets buy the arena no sorry uh can an item

1028
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:02,000
have multiple set shards added no single set shard per item once it becomes a reforged set item by

1029
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:08,000
adding a set shard to the item it is no longer eligible to receive set shard affixes uh for

1030
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
example a belt with pebbles pockmarked sash and isidora's binding tomb binding uh if so does it count as

1031
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:20,000
both sets no it does not it does not work you can only have one set shard on any item and to be

1032
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:29,000
clear um the uh the two rings that are part of a single set static touch and something else that i

1033
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:37,000
can't remember that couch is a good one um also getting nerfed uh rate limited on the uh on the

1034
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:44,000
ward gain i think it gains more ward but it's rate limited that's what it is anyways um you you

1035
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:51,000
cannot put both of those on a single ring either it's just one set affix per item and each set item

1036
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:59,000
has one fixed set affix that it always gives all right are there any plans to add special stash tabs

1037
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:04,000
like unique or set vague plans i would say um this is something i was talking about in the past with the

1038
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:12,000
new um i've talked about this i said there's something coming for uh i kind of teased this before

1039
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:19,000
there's something coming for uh the weaver system that's going to allow us to do like a unique tab

1040
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
easier this is this imprinting thing that i've been talking about so by allowing us to like imprint

1041
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:32,000
items into the into the slots but still keeping that item usable um this lets us uh i just saw a

1042
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
question i'm not taking new questions i swear but i just thought i'm gonna answer anyways does the

1043
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:41,000
imprint node work with uniques yes it does work with uniques and set items um they do have a chance to

1044
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
no longer be set they have a chance to like re-roll into uh non-unique items when they do drop those

1045
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:55,000
so like they don't always drop as uniques but can drop as uniques um so yeah this is that this is what

1046
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:02,000
i was talking about with being able to uh have new tech to to do a unique stash tab better this is this

1047
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
is what i think we can leverage that with uh will the lizards be staying or going staying there'll be

1048
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:13,000
fewer lizards and they will drop fewer items however they will drop higher quality items

1049
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:19,000
um so they'll still be uh like big hype explosions all sort of stuff um but a little bit less crazy

1050
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:25,000
with a little bit better items um just kind of tweaking them into ranges but yes they're sticking

1051
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,000
around they're happy to be here and ain't going anywhere uh do you have plans to look at uniques

1052
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,000
that are underused or have too limited use cases yeah we do we touch on those every once in a while

1053
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:41,000
um sometimes sometimes it's just like a new skill gets added and suddenly unique becomes amazing or

1054
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
you know there's there's things that have incidental knock-on effects a lot especially with uniques

1055
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,000
um and and we have touched some of them we kind of go back and update a few of them every time

1056
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:56,000
uh the goal is not to have every single unique in the game have a top tier end game build that goes

1057
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
with it that's that's never going to happen there's too many uniques and too few builds that'll be top

1058
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:06,000
tier so there's we do like having them have a clear use case and sometimes that's like okay this is an

1059
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
amazing leveling like fire starter torch no one's putting that in an end game build not really unless

1060
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
it's like a challenge or something like that um but leveling as a leveling item it's the go-to leveling

1061
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,000
item for so many classes um and so like even though it doesn't have this like place in the end game

1062
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:28,000
it has a really clear place in the game and so we're um i think we're trying to get more items

1063
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:34,000
to have their own place in the game but uh not necessarily all of them as super powerful end game

1064
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
options the the legendary system in general is supposed to encourage that a little bit more i

1065
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:44,000
think it does a pretty decent job at it uh is there any changes to movement skills uh as just like

1066
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:50,000
sweeping changes overall not hugely um i'm sure lots of them got tweaks uh how difficult do you

1067
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
you think the new uber is compared to the hardest challenge currently in last epoch

1068
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
this is a really tricky question to answer because technically the hardest challenge in last epochs is

1069
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:07,000
one google corruption um just one followed by 100 zeros but or whatever the highest number we can

1070
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
physically put in there based on the data type it is it's probably an integer

1071
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:27,000
um and so it's it's it's probably less difficult than that but of like compared to seriously

1072
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
completable things or fixed difficulty contents it's significantly harder

1073
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:39,000
all right circle but at the same time we are like raising the floor on what characters will be

1074
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:48,000
so like i think more characters will have the shot at taking him down um but it will be extremely hard

1075
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
like in unless you're like unless you have current abroth like on farm you're not gonna have a shot at

1076
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:00,000
beating uber abroth i think unless you're willing to buckle down

1077
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,000
uh forgot to ask circle of fortune changes prophecies are nice but lenses have a bit uh leave a bit to be

1078
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:12,000
desired particularly around targeting item bases and specific affixes yeah so there's um

1079
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
there i can't remember exactly which lens type we took out but we've we've alleviated some of the

1080
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:24,000
pressure that lenses have and restructured some of the the rates on uh like costs for certain prophecies

1081
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
and what they get out of them so like we've we've tweaked some numbers and um pulled some pressure

1082
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,000
off a few of the spots and system but nothing major sweeping changes uh are you open to drastically

1083
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,000
change the weaver's tree each season to give it new flavor or is it mostly set in stone i it's not set

1084
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,000
in stone especially not the first version of it i think maybe if we're like 10 seasons down the road

1085
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:51,000
and um like the weaver's trees in a great spot uh you'd probably see very small changes each patch but

1086
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,000
it's one of those things that it's it's prime for changes it's the way it's set up it loves it loves

1087
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:02,000
being adjusted uh will we have better quality of life for cof prophecy re uh re-rolls especially the

1088
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,000
animation of re-roll takes a long time when you spend 300 000 favor at once i don't know um

1089
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
i think it's a good i think it's a really good idea i think it's a really good suggestion especially

1090
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:23,000
speeding up those those animations um but i don't know i'm sorry we're only 26 minutes behind we're

1091
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:30,000
catching up all right oh we're almost actually at the end of the uh i guess we stopped taking

1092
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
questions about 20 minutes left in this chat so there's only six more minutes of questions

1093
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,000
i love the room master and unique design in the whole arpg genre are there any bigger changes planned

1094
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:48,000
for that class uh i wouldn't say massive changes we're nearly 13 thank you very much for the sub

1095
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:59,000
appreciate it appreciate it uh that's pretty great that's really um i remaster is still pretty fresh

1096
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:05,000
compared to some of the other things out there so i don't think we are targeting it heavily right now

1097
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:11,000
um but i mean everything's on the list it's just where it sits on that list i think there's i think

1098
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
there's other things that are higher on that list like i'd say lich necromancer uh most of primalist

1099
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,000
is probably higher on that list right now um yeah

1100
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
uh what are the inherent advantages of abilities that deal multiple types of damage like smelter's wrath

1101
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:37,000
and disintegrate um well as as we start to add finally start to add um enemies that have really

1102
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:45,000
specifically high defenses to specific to to individual um element types those will um have a better time

1103
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:55,000
in that situation uh will the merophage sword gain set champion affixes uh no because you can't you

1104
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:02,000
can't shatter champion affixes off of a uh because they're sealed affixes and you don't get the shards

1105
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:08,000
from sealed affixes so it'll never shatter one of them for merophage and the set ones uh just don't

1106
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:15,000
work you you just can't put set you can't make a unique into a set uh like a unique set legendary

1107
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
doesn't exist so it will not pull that uh that mod it'll just ignore it because when yeah

1108
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:27,000
also i also i think when you shatter a reforge set item you don't get the when you use a shatter

1109
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,000
stone on it you don't get the set shards that way anyways either you only get them when you

1110
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
shatter them via the mechanic at the end of the tombs

1111
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
all right will pets be able to pick up gold not in season two

1112
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
we are coming we're coming right down to the end of stream here i think this is where we start this

1113
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
that's all the questions i have recorded um at near the end of the stream i do

1114
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,000
want to uh go a little bit a little bit of housekeeping if you stick with me for a minute

1115
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
here uh new release date april 17th

1116
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:04,000
uh twitch drops and supporter creator are moved to april 17th to 21st so they're shifted so it makes

1117
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:09,000
sense with the launch um last season supporter packs also being shifted so it makes sense for

1118
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:15,000
the launch still so you got a couple weeks of overlap before they're removed um so may 2nd last season

1119
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:23,000
supporter packs will be uh going bye-bye um the last two tour dates for our podcasts with um

1120
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:31,000
with try and aaron slash frosty have been moved to april 8th and april 11th respectively um so we're

1121
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:36,000
kind of just pushing everything back about two weeks from where it was uh not exactly perfectly two weeks

1122
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
on all of them but yeah so um new release date 17th twitch drops 17th to 21st

1123
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:46,000
old supporter packs going may 2nd uh podcasts on the 8th and 11th of april

1124
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
well tons of awesome stuff there we are at time and this has been a wonderful stream i know i didn't

1125
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
actually play much i don't think anyone here wants to actually see me play i think we want to hear me

1126
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:01,000
talk and so i think this went well um if you if i did not answer one of your questions and you would

1127
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:06,000
like me to answer it i do apologize it was not intentional um we we do have a discord channel that

1128
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:12,000
ask the devs channel that i hang out in a lot uh we have some great community members in there as

1129
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,000
well that will answer the questions that have been answered before um so please head on over there to

1130
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:24,000
ask questions um we're also pretty active on our socials so like reddit our forums um random youtube

1131
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
comments i'll pop into sometimes for fun uh yeah

1132
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:35,000
whoo i think that's about it i knew anyone got anything cool they want me to say before our

1133
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:43,000
sentence um i had a great time i hope you did too i'll be back same time same place next week so i

1134
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:50,000
got one more stream with all y'all next week uh i'm not sure we're doing on the fourth we'll see

1135
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:57,000
uh something else i think is happening on the fourth that uh i don't know i don't know we'll

1136
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:03,000
come to that when we come to it but next next week i'll be streaming as well um yeah i had a great time

1137
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,000
let's let's go see if there's someone we can go say hi to who's who's out there streaming right now

1141
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
i do know what it is i'm just crazy biased

1142
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:43,000
uh yeah we'll be back next week hope you enjoyed yourselves everybody

1143
