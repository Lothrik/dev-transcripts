00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome back to another last Epoch Devstream.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
As usual, I'm your host, Mike.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And you may notice...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, there's actually more people here than I thought there'd be at the start, considering

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
what's going on today.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But you may notice something lovely behind me here that I'd like to highlight right off

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the bat.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And I've realized that I almost need a better webcam just to show this thing off, because

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
it is unbelievably incredible.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This was sent to me from the Terra Monthly post that we've been covering the development of

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
this thing.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's been being sent out.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And it's here.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And I can't believe it.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's incredible.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's like so detailed.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's so big.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Like, I'm pretty far from it right now, so it actually looks smaller than it is.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But like...

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Like, it's huge!

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I just such a huge, huge, huge thank you.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't even know your real name, but...

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't even know how to pronounce your handle here, but if you're watching, I hope you are.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Um...

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Uh...

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Vezidroga, I love it.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you so much.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It is incredible.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And, uh...

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, it's lit up.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It, like...

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A little remote.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A little remote.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sometimes you gotta get close to it to take the remote work, but...

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's like a rainbow in there.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's hard to see if...

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Rainbow colors, though.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's hard to see the rainbows.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The thing is...

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Incredible.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And it is...

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Like...

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm gonna...

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm gonna...

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm not 100% sure that's where it's gonna go.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I had to get one of the sides and a stud.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So there weren't a lot of options on places to put it.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But I think I really like where it is.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And...

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's just unbelievable.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If you want to see more information on how it was made...

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Um...

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And, like, up close.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Incredible shots of it.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's...

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Uh...

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We've been, um...

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sharing their YouTube channel in our...

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In our, um...

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Entire monthly posts.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So there's links to there.

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's just...

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's so cool.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't get over how cool it is.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Uh...

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And so I'll actually get into the proper stream now.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Uh...

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thanks for indulging me.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because it was so awesome.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Um...

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We're just gonna keep...

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We're just gonna keep playing.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Have some fun here.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But I will answer questions.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, as usual.

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Um...

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Start of stream.

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Highlights.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And info that we need to know.

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Uh...

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We stream for charity.

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Boom.

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Bob my head here.

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All of the...

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Everything that we get from stream goes directly to charity.

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Um...

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you'd like to ask me a question...

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Uh...

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'd be very happy to answer it.

92
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Uh...

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You put...

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
At Last Epoch Game.

95
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Or...

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
At Last Epoch if you're on YouTube.

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And we do collect the...

98
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Uh...

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Questions from both of those places.

100
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Uh...

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Kane will be feeding those to me.

102
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And I will be answering as many of those as I can.

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Um...

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Um...

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I expected to be a little bit slower today.

106
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And that's totally fine.

107
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Um...

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
First question.

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How do you have four raptors?

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I have...

111
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A wonderful ability.

112
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Uh...

113
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
From this weapon here.

114
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It says...

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can summon raptors up to your companion limit.

116
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Um...

117
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And so this lets me summon four raptors.

118
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Because my companion limit is four right now.

119
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Uh...

120
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

121
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So...

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So...

124
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh yeah.

125
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
First sub.

126
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Resub.

127
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Cajun Canuck.

128
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

129
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's a good name.

130
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I love that.

131
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I recognize that name.

132
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thanks for the resub.

133
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Much appreciated.

134
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How am I feeling about the servers for Season 2 launch?

135
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Launch?

136
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I am feeling great about the servers for Season 2 launch.

137
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Um...

138
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If...

139
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If anyone is like...

140
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They were here for like Season 1.

141
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And oh my god.

142
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I just saw a huge big list of stuff go by.

143
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm gonna look at that in a second.

144
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Uh...

145
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We have entirely new physical boxes.

146
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Uh...

147
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
For servers.

148
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We have...

149
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Uh...

150
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Like...

151
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Basically an entirely rewritten netcode for it.

152
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Like it's...

153
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's...

154
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's...

155
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's so much more efficient.

156
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And uh...

157
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm feeling very good about it.

158
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm feeling really good about it.

159
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Mike190Twitch.

160
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thanks to the...

161
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thanks to the...

162
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The three gifted subs there.

163
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And also uh...

164
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
One...

165
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hot...

166
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Genga?

167
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you very much for the sub.

168
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I appreciate it.

169
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Um...

170
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We are uh...

171
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

172
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm...

173
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm feeling really good today.

174
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Getting this thing up.

175
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's...

176
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's very heavy.

177
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And uh...

178
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I was doing...

179
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My wife's um...

180
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Uh...

181
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Quite sick right now.

182
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And unable to help me.

183
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And I had to put it up today.

184
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Um...

185
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And so like holding it up.

186
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
While like trying to line everything up.

187
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It was...

188
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It was tough to get that up on my own.

189
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's...

190
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a meter long.

191
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's crazy.

192
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm gonna keep babbling about it every once in a while.

193
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Because I'm so excited about it.

194
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
All right.

195
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
More questions.

196
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Mike, will you guys ever sell merch?

197
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Like sticker or shirts, etc?

198
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

199
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I have been uh...

200
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Basically...

201
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I guess ask this question every stream.

202
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And every stream I go.

203
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I ask the people who are uh...

204
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In charge of this.

205
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm like...

206
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
When's it coming?

207
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
When's it happening?

208
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Um...

209
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So yep.

210
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Uh...

211
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's...

212
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It is...

213
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's on...

214
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's on the agenda.

215
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have no idea when it's coming.

216
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't have any more information than you do on it.

217
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Um...

218
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But I do know that it is something that I have been uh...

219
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I've been also asking for it for a while.

220
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And...

221
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Should be...

222
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Should be on its way.

223
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Should be on its way.

224
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I hope.

225
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Uh...

226
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Any great leaks today?

227
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh yeah.

228
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Uh...

229
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not gonna spill...

230
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We're six minutes in.

231
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just...

232
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just...

233
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Just a little bit in.

234
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But I got some.

235
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't worry.

236
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Uh...

237
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Will we have an old man mode?

238
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Aka cursor size adjustment coming.

239
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We don't have a way to adjust the cursor size just yet.

240
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Um...

241
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There are a couple uh...

242
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Workarounds that people have found.

243
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Um...

244
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I think if you increase the size of the cursor like in Windows itself.

245
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Or in your operating system.

246
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Um...

247
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Before launching the game.

248
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think it carries over into the game.

249
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you can get a pretty big mouse cursor that way.

250
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Uh...

251
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can also use...

252
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Um...

253
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Uh...

254
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yolo Mouse is acceptable to use.

255
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
For uh...

256
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Increasing your cursor size.

257
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Which I know is not everyone's cup of tea.

258
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But um...

259
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We...

260
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It is something that we do want to do.

261
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
To improve the cursor size.

262
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And have that be customizable.

263
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Like...

264
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Uh...

265
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Different colors for the cursor.

266
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And um...

267
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Different sizes is something that we do really want to do.

268
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is not a for lack of trying.

269
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Uh...

270
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not here type thing issue still.

271
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Alright.

272
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm really excited.

273
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
To have everyone try the new...

274
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The new Season 2 content.

275
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So excited.

276
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Alright.

277
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Mike.

278
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
PoE 2 launch.

279
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Having bad performance.

280
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Really?

281
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I haven't uh...

282
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I haven't had a chance to hop in this morning.

283
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I know they're like...

284
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They're just...

285
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They're just up right now.

286
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Um...

287
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I've got it downloaded.

288
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And I'll be...

289
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll be checking it out this weekend.

290
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Got some time.

291
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Maybe this evening.

292
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh no.

293
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I got a bug to fix this evening.

294
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Maybe this weekend.

295
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Um...

296
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh we're out.

297
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We're out of here.

298
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My thoughts on avoiding it.

299
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I mean we're gonna...

300
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We've been planning and preparing for this.

301
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Um...

302
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't know what their numbers are looking like right now.

303
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I assume they're gigantic numbers right now.

304
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Um...

305
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And...

306
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Uh...

307
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Like we've got...

308
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Way more than we're...

309
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We've got...

310
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Everything set up for way more than we're expecting.

311
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Um...

312
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And we've got plans for like...

313
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
In case we're wildly off.

314
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We've got plans...

315
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Contingency plans for that as well.

316
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
By people that are much smarter than I am.

317
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
All right.

318
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How many teasers have you prepared for today?

319
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have.

320
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think I have five.

321
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
One.

322
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Two.

323
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Three.

324
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Four.

325
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Five.

326
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have five.

327
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Hi Mike.

328
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Chronicler class when?

329
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Ooh.

330
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Chronicler class is interesting.

331
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's um...

332
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So like...

333
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't have a specific time frame.

334
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm not gonna confirm or deny it coming or whatever.

335
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But like...

336
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
As an idea of a class.

337
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I am really interested in this style of class.

338
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Um...

339
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And I don't know if it's like...

340
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think...

341
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think it's a mage mastering.

342
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Not its own class personally.

343
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Um...

344
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But...

345
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Who...

346
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Who knows?

347
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Who knows?

348
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Who knows?

349
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Who knows?

350
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Who knows?

351
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Who knows?

352
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Who knows?

353
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Who knows?

354
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Who knows?

355
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Who knows?

356
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I think like...

357
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
In the hypothetical scenario that we were gonna do something like that...

358
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'd be pushing for it to be a mastery.

359
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Not its own class.

360
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Because...

361
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's...

362
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I think it's really hard to get like...

363
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Specific masteries.

364
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like three full masteries for it.

365
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Alright...

366
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Last Epoch.

367
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Can you remap joysticks in the new version?

368
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Trying to play Ellie on my arcade that runs by Steam Deck.

369
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I can't figure out how to remap the movement.

370
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh...

371
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't think so.

372
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think you have to do some like...

373
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Software shantigans beforehand to get that to work.

374
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Get back here, boy.

375
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Get back here!

376
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Run, Forest!

377
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's...

378
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That was that...

379
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Uh...

380
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Um...

381
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That lizard's name was Forest and it didn't run fast enough.

382
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Go, Rune.

383
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Alright...

384
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Even if...

385
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Uh...

386
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Super rare...

387
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Will we be pleasantly surprised by hybrid or champion affixes when using...

388
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Discovery or other RNG-based runes and glyphs?

389
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Uh...

390
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No.

391
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Uh...

392
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So...

393
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hybrid yes, champion no.

394
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Um...

395
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You can get hybrid affixes to show up with...

396
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Uh...

397
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This runes of discovery already.

398
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Um...

399
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But the champion-specific ones are only available...

400
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
From the champion affixes.

401
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We've earned a hype chest.

402
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Click to see a reward.

403
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay.

404
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey, there's an emote.

405
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Cool.

406
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Things happen sometimes and I'm like...

407
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I didn't know that was a thing.

408
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Alright.

409
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Uh...

410
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hey, Mike.

411
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Do you guys know the date of the full reveal video?

412
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Uh...

413
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I think that comes with patch notes, right?

414
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's...

415
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm pretty sure that's always same day as patch notes.

416
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So the...

417
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Uh...

418
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Eleven.

419
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Right?

420
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, the eleven.

421
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Alright.

422
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Loving the new shrines from 1.5.

423
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Are there going to be any more introduced in Season 2?

424
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yes, we are.

425
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Um...

426
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We've reworked a couple of the shrines that maybe didn't...

427
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Didn't quite stick the landing.

428
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Because most of them have been great.

429
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Some of them not so awesome.

430
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There's a few little things here and there that we're tweaking on some of them.

431
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Um...

432
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There's a few reworked ones.

433
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A few new ones.

434
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's not a huge focus.

435
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But there is, uh...

436
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There's some new shake up there.

437
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's a system that we're very happy with overall.

438
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Um...

439
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So there didn't need to be, like, a huge, like...

440
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Overhaul of the structure of it to...

441
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
To really get to where we want to be with it.

442
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Just because I can't bring myself to throw stuff away.

443
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hello, Mike!

444
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hope you're doing great.

445
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I am.

446
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Thank you.

447
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Any chance of an updated roadmap coming out soon?

448
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I think we're going to wait until post...

449
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Uh...

450
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Post-season 2 a little bit before we look at...

451
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Look beyond it.

452
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Right now we're really focusing on Season 2.

453
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Um...

454
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And getting that...

455
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Uh...

456
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Getting that out the door.

457
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And...

458
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And all of our, like...

459
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Pipe focus is around Season 2.

460
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So we don't want to distract from that.

461
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Be like...

462
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Season 2 is coming!

463
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But, like...

464
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Here's a roadmap for what's after that!

465
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Like...

466
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah.

467
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah.

468
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah.

469
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Uh...

470
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Can you say something about Void Beams?

471
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Anything?

472
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Are they more...

473
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Are they more purple now?

474
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Um...

475
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There was...

476
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hmm...

477
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know enough off the top of my head.

478
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I remember working on something with Void Beams near the start of the patch cycle.

479
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And I can't remember what happened to it.

480
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hmm...

481
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Hmm...

482
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hmm...

483
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hmm...

484
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hmm...

485
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hmm...

486
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Hmm...

487
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
There was a bug around Void Beams that we fixed.

488
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Months ago.

489
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't remember what the bug was.

490
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There's a bug fixed with them!

491
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Um...

492
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
How much did combat...

493
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Feel, skill visuals, and sound SFX improve in Season 2 compared to Season 1?

494
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Uh...

495
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I would say significantly.

496
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Partially just from the, like...

497
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The...

498
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The...

499
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I guess...

500
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
A lot of that stuff is the...

501
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When there's something that doesn't fit...

502
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It...

503
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Or feels weird.

504
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It really sticks out and can...

505
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Can take you out of the experience.

506
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And...

507
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Um...

508
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Like...

509
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Like, even if it's just like a sound that you're using an ability on that's...

510
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Um...

511
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Like, you use the ability 800 times.

512
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And it's just kind of a...

513
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Not quite great sound effect.

514
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Uh...

515
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And it starts to really stand out and...

516
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You really notice the bad pieces.

517
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And...

518
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And a lot of those, like...

519
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
A lot of those have been smoothed out.

520
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Um...

521
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like a nice piece of sandpaper to finish it off.

522
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And...

523
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Uh...

524
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I think...

525
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I think...

526
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I think a little goes a long way with that sort of thing.

527
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So, like...

528
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Maybe it's not a complete overhaul of something.

529
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But you get...

530
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
A lot of value out of...

531
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Um...

532
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Small changes.

533
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Things just feel better.

534
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There's just...

535
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You know...

536
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
In general.

537
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Or this way.

538
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Also the...

539
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Uh...

540
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The new...

541
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Wow, there's a lot of people here for...

542
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What I expected.

543
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Because of what's happening today.

544
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Um...

545
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The...

546
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Also...

547
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Uh...

548
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The skill visuals.

549
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The MTX.

550
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Skill MTX for...

551
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Cosmetics for skills.

552
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I think has a huge impact on the fit and feel.

553
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Of...

554
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Of abilities.

555
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Because you can really...

556
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know.

557
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Make them pop.

558
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Uh...

559
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Especially with...

560
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
When you want something to look a specific way.

561
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You can do that now.

562
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Um...

563
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I think...

564
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I think that's gonna play a big role in...

565
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The...

566
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like...

567
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Awesome factor.

568
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The X factor.

569
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Uh...

570
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you see a problem with the release date?

571
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Because Torch...

572
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Torch, Light, Infinite have the same date.

573
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Um...

574
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I mean...

575
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
April...

576
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
April's a minefield, right?

577
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Is...

578
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Is there a day in April that's...

579
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That's really amazing.

580
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Um...

581
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I think that it would be...

582
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You know...

583
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Better if we were able to...

584
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Be completely...

585
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Avoiding all of the other games...

586
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Similar games.

587
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There's...

588
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There's games releasing every day though.

589
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So like...

590
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We're never gonna avoid everything.

591
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And lots of people play mini genres.

592
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So it's...

593
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I think we just gotta do the best job we can.

594
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's not ideal.

595
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's what we're going with.

596
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:23,000
When can we expect a new weapon class?

597
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Anything in the works?

598
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Uh...

599
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Anything that you can tell us...

600
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That you're super interested in bringing to the weapons?

601
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Although keep the weight loss man at the head.

602
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Say it every time.

603
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You look great, dude.

604
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Thank you.

605
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I feel great.

606
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It is...

607
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Wild.

608
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Um...

609
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
As far as new weapon classes...

610
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Um...

611
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I was...

612
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There's some vague...

613
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Rumblings about some new weapon classes.

614
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But nothing...

615
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Really specific.

616
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Thanks, Cain.

617
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Um...

618
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There's...

619
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There's...

620
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah, I would say there's...

621
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
There's definitely some weapons that I really want to get in.

622
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'd really love to get in...

623
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Some one-handed spears.

624
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Um...

625
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Like, let me know how they're doing...

626
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
In...

627
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Um...

628
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
In...

629
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
In PvE2 right now, right?

630
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Uh...

631
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'd really love to get in some fist weapons.

632
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Like, whether it looks like claws...

633
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Or...

634
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You know, just like...

635
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like...

636
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Arm attachments where you're like...

637
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Your animations are very, very punchy.

638
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Or where they're actually like...

639
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Like brass knuckle style fist weapons.

640
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Or...

641
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know, like...

642
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Um...

643
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Not really boxing gloves necessarily.

644
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But you know, that...

645
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That style of...

646
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I guess a martial arts extension...

647
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Um...

648
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Type weapon would be really nice.

649
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,000
There's...

650
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There was some weapons...

651
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There's some armor from...

652
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Like, Guild Wars 1...

653
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Had...

654
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I thought some of them...

655
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The monk class...

656
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Had some unbelievably cool theming around their...

657
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Uh...

658
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Some of their armor as tattoos.

659
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Which I loved.

660
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Um...

661
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And...

662
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't know, I'd love to do something like that.

663
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I know that's armor, not weapons.

664
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But...

665
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I think that would be really cool.

666
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I think the big thing is that...

667
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Most of those things need a class...

668
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Uh...

669
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,000
To go with it.

670
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Next question.

671
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Will any other classes be getting much interaction...

672
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
With void damage in Season 2?

673
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No.

674
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Uh...

675
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Void damage is still pretty localized...

676
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
To Void Knight in Season 2.

677
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There's some...

678
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There's some outliers here and there.

679
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Um...

680
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Like the...

681
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Uh...

682
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
There's a little touch of it on Mage here and there.

683
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Um...

684
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's already there though.

685
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's not like something new.

686
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Um...

687
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Um...

688
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, I don't think there's...

689
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There's more stuff in Sentinel that's getting Void Conversions...

690
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
To make that a more...

691
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Uh...

692
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Like a less restrictive element style to play as a Sentinel.

693
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Right.

694
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
When you break down a set for shards...

695
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do the two affixes that break down exist on a single shard?

696
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Or are they separated shards?

697
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Um...

698
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
They exist on a single shard.

699
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So a set affix...

700
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Shard...

701
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Uh...

702
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Contains two affixes...

703
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
A hybrid affix on it.

704
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Similar to...

705
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Like...

706
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So...

707
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Like this one right here.

708
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
This is...

709
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Uh...

710
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There's one prefix...

711
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
On this item.

712
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Um...

713
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like if we...

714
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If we do...

715
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Not gonna...

716
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's fine.

717
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So here like...

718
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There's an empty slot on this item.

719
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
There's...

720
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,000
There's...

721
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There's only one prefix here.

722
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But there's two stats...

723
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,000
To it.

724
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So it's the same style of thing.

725
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Where a single prefix will be...

726
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Uh...

727
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Multiple stats...

728
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
On an item.

729
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Uh...

730
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
For the set shard affixes.

731
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Our chest is not great.

732
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's fine.

733
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Because that minion melee damage is nice.

734
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That one stat is like holding it up.

735
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
We've got more!

736
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We've got more subs coming in!

737
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Uh...

738
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Uh...

739
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Uh...

740
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Uh...

741
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
USA, American, and Anonymous.

742
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you for the subs.

743
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I appreciate it.

744
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Alright...

745
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Uh...

746
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What...

747
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What...

748
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
has the team been doing with the extra time?

749
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Um...

750
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Mostly bug fixes.

751
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There's...

752
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So there's a lot of things where we are...

753
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
We know like...

754
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
As we get closer to a patch launch, we lock down the version that's going to be launched

755
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
as the first version for the patch, and we do very rigorous testing on it to make sure

756
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
that it is bug-free.

757
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And...

758
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Woo!

759
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So that it is bug-free.

760
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You know, it feels good and all that sort of stuff.

761
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And then we start working on hotfix elements to put in for early hotfixes after the patch

762
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
launches.

763
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So we just kind of pushed back the process a little bit, where the things that we had already

764
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
been working on for hotfixes, because we'd already locked it down, and so we opened it

765
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
back up again and took stuff that people were working on for hotfixes and put those into

766
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the launch version.

767
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And now we're working on new things for hotfixes.

768
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
There's always new things to add.

769
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
There's always new things to improve upon slightly.

770
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's usually pretty low-risk, high-reward items as we can get at this stage.

771
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So finding narrow issues where it's like, okay, if a character walks in with these three abilities

772
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
equipped and they use this ability right in this spot, there's a painful bug that happens.

773
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You know, things like that.

774
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So, when are we getting minion AI improvements?

775
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Melee minions, especially all target one mob at a time instead of intelligently spreading

776
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
out.

777
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Makes clear speed awful with them even when they have great damage.

778
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah, this is an interesting thing, because I think thematically, you know, they shouldn't

779
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
coordinate perfectly necessarily.

780
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But at the same time, you know, nothing needs to be 100% perfect thematically appropriate.

781
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So we can, you know, make them coordinate a little bit better.

782
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And I think there's situations where it's easier to stretch that a little bit to make

783
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
them coordinate better.

784
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We don't have any major changes for like a coordinated AI to manage the different minions.

785
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We've tried a few tweaks on the system a little bit to try and make that happen a little bit

786
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
organically.

787
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And usually it causes worse clear speed.

788
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But we are, it's on the list, I would say.

789
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's especially an issue when you get really, really large armies.

790
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So like right now here with four Raptors, it's really not that big of a deal because they're

791
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:52,000
not fighting the space to find things with each other.

792
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But with like 30 skeletons, it's an issue.

793
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
All right, well, maybe not as big as PoE.

794
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What is it like having such a dedicated fan base that completely and absolutely supports

795
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
you, especially amid recent controversies?

796
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's it's incredible.

797
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's incredible.

798
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You know, like I remember when we when we started out and like we're sitting around

799
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
celebrating like like one person of like back to us on Kickstarter, like the first like

800
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and that was a huge celebration, just like the first person.

801
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And you know, like the first like real sale of the game after after we were officially launched.

802
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And all these things of like milestones of just just one was incredible.

803
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And

804
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
it's yeah, it feels amazing.

805
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And like I'll talk to like family friends who I haven't seen in a while.

806
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And and they'll be like.

807
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I've I've I've I've had a few organic moments of like people who I've talked to didn't realize

808
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I was working on on this specific game.

809
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And, you know, and I we get chatting.

810
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Like, oh, what are you doing?

811
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What are you doing?

812
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Like this catching up sort of thing and they realize and there's that connection of like,

813
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
oh, you're working on that.

814
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I've been playing that.

815
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And that's really cool to see, too.

816
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Um.

817
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah.

818
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah.

819
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I wear my shirt to the store sometimes.

820
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I haven't I haven't been stopped.

821
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But no one's no one's walked out to me and been like, I play that game, too, which is probably

822
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
a social interaction that doesn't happen very often.

823
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But one day it will be awesome.

824
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I really love it was I was I was wearing.

825
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I was wearing a shirt that just had like a little Protoss insignia on the side of it.

826
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Just just like just the Protoss like logo on the on the on the right left shoulder here.

827
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And I was at a grocery.

828
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
This is like a decade ago.

829
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I was at a grocery store and someone else's is is there and they've got like a similar

830
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
style shirt, but it's like a Zerg logo.

831
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And it's just like a we didn't say anything to each other.

832
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It was just a moment of like we both noticed it at the same time and notice each other noticing

833
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
it and have like a little like type moment, which is which is fun.

834
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I like that a lot.

835
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And Fernal 246, thank you very much for the sub.

836
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I am also super pumped for season two.

837
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Kind of unreasonably pumped.

838
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Is that a thing?

839
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Maybe it is reasonable.

840
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Very.

841
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Very.

842
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
All right.

843
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
More questions.

844
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
No question today.

845
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Oh, no, that's OK.

846
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
We'll read the comment.

847
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That's fine.

848
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Just want to talk to you about controller.

849
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Just want you to talk about controller for 30 seconds.

850
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Sure.

851
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
We can talk about controllers for 30 seconds.

852
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Sure.

853
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We can talk about controllers for 30 seconds.

854
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What's it?

855
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What's it?

856
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
What's it?

857
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
What's it?

858
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What's it?

859
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What's it?

860
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What's it?

861
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What's it?

862
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
What's it?

863
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What's it?

864
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What's it?

865
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What's it?

866
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What's it?

867
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What's it?

868
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I want to put our weapon in, but I don't want to lose it.

869
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Stargoon TV!

870
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Thank you very much for the sub.

871
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I appreciate it.

872
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Oh, we gotta put something good in here.

873
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,000
What are we putting here?

874
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I want to put our weapon in, but I don't want to lose it.

875
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Do we have another tooth?

876
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
We have no other teeth.

877
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The weapon that everyone wants

878
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Voidcleave to work with.

879
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Hey, an OG gambler's fallacy.

880
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Is that right?

881
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Yeah.

882
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Sure.

883
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What can we talk about controllers for a minute?

884
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I mean, the big thing with controllers, I feel like I'm just rambling and repeating myself with controllers.

885
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The new targeting system for it is really great.

886
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I was actually playtesting last night for an unrelated bug, but I was just like, I'm just like, I'm going to test on controller because I feel like it tonight.

887
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And I really don't play controller very often, but it feels a lot better to the point that I'm kind of like considering doing it more.

888
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Because it's finally able to, I don't know.

889
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It feels a lot better that the having a target smartly is so great.

890
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The context and specialization specific targeting is so much nicer.

891
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Just the, like, it doesn't always shoot.

892
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I was testing a boss fight and having it, and I was shooting fireball.

893
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And as you're running around the outside of the boss, like running the perimeter, like dodging an attack and pressing fireball.

894
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And it shoots at the boss instead of shooting forward, just like, just out of your face was so nice.

895
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, like, this is an example of the things we were doing.

896
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So, like, an example of things we were fixing at the last second that we did with the extra two weeks, the question earlier, just to add on to it.

897
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So, like, there's a bug where the new bosses, some of the new bosses that are available as Woven Echoes.

898
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
If a player joined midway through that boss fight, the animations for the boss fight never started.

899
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So, you couldn't, you couldn't see the boss properly.

900
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It would, like, function, but you couldn't see the boss doing its attacks.

901
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And so, we had to fix that.

902
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It was only for the second person who joined, not the first person who joined at the start.

903
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And he, like, created it.

904
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So, it was, like, obscure things that you don't, uh, you don't really find right away.

905
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That's the sort of stuff.

906
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Alright.

907
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Hello!

908
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Guilds with maybe guild locked trading slash gifting is something that you guys have thought of?

909
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Uh, party is cool, but guilds are better.

910
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes, we thought of that.

911
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
We aren't going to...

912
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
One of the options we considered when we were designing the, uh, the conditional trade system in the first place,

913
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
when we went with the bazaar, one of the options we considered was having, uh, something we were calling warbands.

914
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Um, which were, like, basically, like, mini trade groups, like, trade guilds, uh, that people could be in.

915
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Um, we're not, we didn't go with that, and we're not planning on doing that.

916
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Uh, if we do, we are interested in a guild system, um, but it won't, it'll have the same restrictions for, uh, when we eventually get around to doing it,

917
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
it'll have the same restrictions for trade as with anyone else.

918
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
There won't be, like, uh, we're not planning to have a way where you get to trade easier inside your guild.

919
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Um, you can be able to connect with each other easier that way, but, um, you'll still require the same amount of favor,

920
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and still have the same merchant skilled ranks, um, and all that sort of stuff.

921
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Alright.

922
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What are your thoughts on bringing finishers to the game, like, on death, like an on death huge hammer that slams into the enemy, onto the enemy?

923
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Like an, like an on death?

924
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Like,

925
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
like,

926
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:54,000
like, like, like we're talking like Mortal Kombat fatalities type thing,

927
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
um,

928
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
where it's like,

929
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
they're already dead,

930
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and there's just like a cool animation that happens to like, really sell it,

931
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
or,

932
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I mean, I could see that being really awesome for boss fights,

933
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
where like, when the boss fight finishes,

934
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and there's like an epic coup de grace that happens that like, finishes the,

935
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,000
the,

936
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
the actual fight as,

937
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,000
as a,

938
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,000
like a,

939
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
almost like a in-game mini cinematic or something like that,

940
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
that I think would be awesome.

941
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Um,

942
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
whenever I see on death,

943
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I always seem like,

944
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
like when the thing dies,

945
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
it uses the ability,

946
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and then that thing that everyone asks,

947
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
like just hates.

948
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Um,

949
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
not planning that.

950
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
All right,

951
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I think I asked too early,

952
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
but when is hype week?

953
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Normally it ends when the patch,

954
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
with the patch notes,

955
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
the update,

956
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
but the patch notes are six days before the update,

957
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
so it's hype week leading up to the 11th,

958
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,000
or the 11th,

959
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
17th,

960
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and end with the update.

961
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Um,

962
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I don't know.

963
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Um,

964
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,000
patch note,

965
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
usually it ends with patch notes,

966
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
so I assume it would end with the,

967
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
the like,

968
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
the posts going out would end,

969
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
like the,

970
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,000
hmm,

971
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I don't know,

972
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
it's a good question.

973
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Cain,

974
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
if you know the answer to when hype week is scheduled,

975
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
please let me know,

976
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
because I don't know.

977
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
All right.

978
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Mike,

979
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
did you hear that EHE has been rumored working on,

980
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
a character sheet rework,

981
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
this is your reminder.

982
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I can no longer confirm,

983
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,000
or,

984
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
yes,

985
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,000
we are working on that.

986
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Um,

987
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
if they will not arrive in season two,

988
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I apologize.

989
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I got,

990
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I got a little note here that says hype week,

991
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
sooner than you think.

992
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Exciting.

993
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Uh,

994
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
any new unique idols?

995
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Ooh,

996
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,000
yeah.

997
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Um,

998
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,000
oh,

999
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,000
no,

1000
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
we didn't make it into season two.

1001
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Uh,

1002
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
maybe for season two.

1003
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:11,000
the sweet one plan for season three,

1004
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I'll tell you that much.

1005
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
All right.

1006
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:23,000
All right.

1007
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Will the skill MTX also affect how the skill looks in the skills bar?

1008
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I forgot how it was killed.

1009
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,000
No,

1010
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
it doesn't affect the,

1011
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
the skill bar icon.

1012
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Um,

1013
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
that is something that we are interested in doing though.

1014
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Having the,

1015
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
having some sort of indication on the skill itself,

1016
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
if it's been converted.

1017
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So there's,

1018
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
there's a couple options that we're considering there.

1019
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
One is making like thematically,

1020
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
uh,

1021
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
flipped versions of this skill.

1022
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So like having like a summon,

1023
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,000
thorn totem,

1024
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
but there's like a cold theme,

1025
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,000
summon,

1026
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
thorn totem icon.

1027
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And when you,

1028
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
when you specialize it,

1029
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
it like switches the icon out.

1030
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Um,

1031
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
the second option is just putting this icon in the corner to be like,

1032
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
it's specialized to cold and boom,

1033
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
there's a cold icon there.

1034
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Um,

1035
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
we've been,

1036
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I know that's not MTX specifically,

1037
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the cosmetics,

1038
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
that's the like functionality version of it.

1039
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Um,

1040
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
it's possible.

1041
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
The cosmetic one could come with the same thing.

1042
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
If we did the full icon swap,

1043
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
it's a,

1044
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
it's like just an extra thing.

1045
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That's something you like.

1046
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,000
It's kind of,

1047
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
it's a tech debt thing.

1048
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So every time you,

1049
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
when you add a system like that,

1050
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
it makes the process of adding in,

1051
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,000
uh,

1052
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
conversions or new cosmetics take a little bit longer.

1053
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It's a very low cost tech debt,

1054
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
but it is like,

1055
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,000
that's,

1056
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
that's exactly the sort of thing that you kind of try and avoid in a lot of

1057
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,000
situations.

1058
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Um,

1059
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
but I think it's something that we are probably going to do eventually.

1060
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Just,

1061
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
there's a lot of icons to redo or,

1062
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,000
uh,

1063
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I have all our alt art versions of for that.

1064
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Cause like there's some skills that have like three or maybe even four

1065
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
elemental versions sometimes.

1066
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I guess,

1067
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I guess one of the big things is delve a little bit deeper.

1068
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
One of the big things is we want the abilities to be really recognizable on

1069
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,000
your bar.

1070
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
When someone's like,

1071
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,000
okay,

1072
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
what ability is that?

1073
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Or like you open up,

1074
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,000
uh,

1075
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
like a,

1076
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,000
a,

1077
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
a build tool type thing.

1078
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And it,

1079
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it shows specific abilities on there.

1080
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You want to be able to recognize what that is quickly.

1081
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And having that quick recognition is really important.

1082
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Um,

1083
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
and color has a lot to do with that.

1084
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
All right.

1085
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Are you planning to add a system that we can invade other players,

1086
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
model it as a PVP aspect.

1087
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So like,

1088
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,000
um,

1089
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,000
like,

1090
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,000
like,

1091
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,000
uh,

1092
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
from soft PVP style.

1093
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Um,

1094
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
not something that we're currently planning.

1095
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Uh,

1096
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't hate the idea though.

1097
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I think it's like,

1098
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
it gives me real D2 vibes where,

1099
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,000
you know,

1100
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
like you can just be playing in a public game and someone shows up and

1101
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
hostiles you.

1102
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And you're like,

1103
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh,

1104
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh,

1105
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,000
um,

1106
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
and cause everyone just like auto parties at the start.

1107
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000
They,

1108
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
they know where you are and you're like,

1109
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Oh God,

1110
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
they could be around any corner.

1111
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And,

1112
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
and like some of the most fun I've had in D2 came from moments like

1113
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
that.

1114
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Um,

1115
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I think it would need to be,

1116
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I think it worked in the age that Diablo two was released in

1117
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,000
initially.

1118
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Um,

1119
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and I don't think it would go over quite as well.

1120
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Uh,

1121
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,000
being so,

1122
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
uh,

1123
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
like such like a wild west type thing.

1124
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Um,

1125
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
if we,

1126
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
if we didn't allow people to opt out of it,

1127
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I think that's the big thing.

1128
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yes.

1129
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
But have to be able to opt out of it.

1130
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I w yeah,

1131
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
that was,

1132
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
that was one of the things I had,

1133
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,000
uh,

1134
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
now I'm not going to show that story.

1135
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
All right.

1136
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Uh,

1137
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
last Epoch is,

1138
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,000
is,

1139
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
at last Epoch,

1140
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
is one of the woven echoes,

1141
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
a boss rush type?

1142
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Yes.

1143
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I,

1144
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,000
it's,

1145
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,000
it's not like,

1146
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
like every monolith boss or something like that altogether,

1147
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
but there are,

1148
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
um,

1149
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
there are boss echoes where it's specifically like a,

1150
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,000
a,

1151
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
a boss format.

1152
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Um,

1153
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and like there are some,

1154
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,000
there's,

1155
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
there's somewhere it's like a whole bunch of mini bosses,

1156
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
uh,

1157
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
like a whole bunch of them.

1158
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Uh,

1159
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
yeah.

1160
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Here's,

1161
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,000
here's,

1162
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,000
here's a good one.

1163
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Here we go.

1164
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's a good time for this.

1165
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Okay.

1166
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
This is a little peek at the,

1167
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
um,

1168
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
at the weaver tree.

1169
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Here's a full picture of all of the nodes in the weaver tree that is coming.

1170
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So you want to know the size.

1171
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Um,

1172
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
here it is.

1173
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's decently large.

1174
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
It is,

1175
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
uh,

1176
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
yeah,

1177
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,000
you can,

1178
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
you can zoom in pretty far.

1179
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You can pan around.

1180
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Um,

1181
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
yeah.

1182
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You got an ad ready.

1183
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's happening.

1184
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay.

1185
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'll wait.

1186
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'll wait for your ad to finish.

1187
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I didn't,

1188
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I don't know how to run ads or stop them running.

1189
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
They just kind of happen.

1190
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Well,

1191
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,000
we'll,

1192
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,000
we'll,

1193
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
we'll wait a bit.

1194
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We'll leave it,

1195
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
we'll leave it up for a second.

1196
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'll answer another question.

1197
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So not just,

1198
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I just noticed someone asked you start in the center.

1199
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yes,

1200
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
you start in the center.

1201
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Um,

1202
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
and then you branch out from there.

1203
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Uh,

1204
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000
the,

1205
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm pretty sure everything's only a one point requirement to move on.

1206
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Um,

1207
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
but there are multi-point nodes.

1208
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So you can,

1209
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
um,

1210
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
uh,

1211
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,000
yeah.

1212
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So you,

1213
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
you can like get,

1214
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,000
you can,

1215
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
you can traverse it pretty quickly.

1216
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Um,

1217
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
yeah.

1218
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And this is the sort of thing that will like,

1219
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,000
as,

1220
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
as the seasons go on,

1221
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
this is designed very much to be,

1222
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
um,

1223
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
expanded upon.

1224
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So we can add in like really easily.

1225
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
If we add like a new type of activity to happen at end game,

1226
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
we can expand this tree and add new things into it.

1227
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Or,

1228
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,000
you know,

1229
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
like modify nodes to be like,

1230
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,000
okay,

1231
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
well this works in,

1232
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,000
uh,

1233
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
echoes type a,

1234
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
B and C.

1235
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And then we add new echo type D E and F.

1236
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And then we just add D enough to that node.

1237
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And so it works in multiple places.

1238
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So we can,

1239
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
we can expand individual nodes and expand the number of nodes on this.

1240
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We can add new point max,

1241
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
like point maximums.

1242
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
If we add too many new nodes,

1243
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,000
we'll be like,

1244
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
here's more points.

1245
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Um,

1246
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
maybe there's certain nodes that like,

1247
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
this is something that we'll be rebalancing and,

1248
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,000
uh,

1249
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and keeping an eye on going forward.

1250
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Cause it's going to be a prime part of our end game for a long time.

1251
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah.

1252
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
All right.

1253
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Any chance of a corruption leaderboard being in the books?

1254
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
We are looking at new leaderboard types.

1255
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Um,

1256
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
and that is one of the most highly requested ones.

1257
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Um,

1258
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I don't have an ETA on it.

1259
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm sorry.

1260
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,000
All right.

1261
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
How much graphically can you guys improve the game more on this version of unity?

1262
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I don't know.

1263
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I don't know.

1264
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I don't,

1265
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
um,

1266
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I mean,

1267
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,000
there's,

1268
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
there's always room without changing the engine to improve the graphic quality.

1269
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Um,

1270
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
but I don't,

1271
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I also don't think we're like stuck on this version of unity forever.

1272
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I think since doing the last update,

1273
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
it'll be a lot easier to do more updates.

1274
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Um,

1275
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I have no idea if we're going to do more anytime soon or not.

1276
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Cause this was,

1277
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
it was a pretty big deal to do the one we did.

1278
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Um,

1279
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
but I hope so.

1280
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I hope,

1281
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I hope we keep updating the version of the engine version,

1282
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
both from a,

1283
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
like what we can do in a tooling perspective as well.

1284
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's actually like working in,

1285
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
it gets nicer as well.

1286
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It was really good.

1287
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Do I have an approximate size,

1288
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
uh,

1289
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
for the download for season two?

1290
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,000
No,

1291
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I don't.

1292
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm,

1293
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm assuming it'll be several gigabytes.

1294
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
It's about as vague as I could say that.

1295
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I just don't,

1296
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I just don't know.

1297
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
If you're,

1298
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
if you've got a good internet connection and you're,

1299
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,000
uh,

1300
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
and like steam will pull it down so fast,

1301
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
but I know for some people it takes,

1302
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
it takes a long time,

1303
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
uh,

1304
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
to get that downloaded.

1305
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And therefore is a significant concern.

1306
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Uh,

1307
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
are there any changes coming to the normal,

1308
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and endless arena?

1309
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yes.

1310
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Um,

1311
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
mostly just like quality of life stuff.

1312
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
There's not huge mechanical changes happening for the arenas.

1313
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Um,

1314
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
there's more stuff that's going to be happening in there.

1315
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Some more mechanics that'll exist in there.

1316
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Uh,

1317
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
it's sped up a little bit to like smooth things out.

1318
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Um,

1319
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,000
it just,

1320
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
it plays a little better.

1321
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It feels a little better.

1322
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
There it's,

1323
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
it's just a little more fun and sort of lots of touches.

1324
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
There's not,

1325
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,000
um,

1326
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
a massive overhaul that's happening.

1327
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
One big change that we did do,

1328
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,000
um,

1329
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,000
in,

1330
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
it just in the UI.

1331
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
So this,

1332
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
you can see this as Docklands arena.

1333
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So you can see that this says arena.

1334
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
There's also different types of arenas now too.

1335
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Um,

1336
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,000
in,

1337
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
in the,

1338
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,000
uh,

1339
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
monolith,

1340
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
there's different types of arenas.

1341
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And so this says arena.

1342
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So you can tell that it's an arena,

1343
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
but like,

1344
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,000
so few,

1345
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
so few people actually read the name.

1346
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
They just like look at the stuff and then right click on it.

1347
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And when you right click,

1348
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
you don't get the name populating here.

1349
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Cause the name doesn't populate on the right information panel.

1350
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Um,

1351
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
so now the icons in the,

1352
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
uh,

1353
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
monolith for arenas look like an arena.

1354
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So you can see at a glance,

1355
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
which ones are the arenas without needing to use the search function.

1356
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Um,

1357
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,000
which there's,

1358
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
there's new,

1359
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
this is getting updated to this.

1360
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It's getting moved over to the right and it's getting new filters added to it as well.

1361
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Uh,

1362
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
which percentage of skills,

1363
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
all classes have had their numbers balanced buffs and nurse in,

1364
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
in any way at all,

1365
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
like one node having 1% change counts for this question.

1366
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
90%.

1367
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Maybe,

1368
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,000
maybe,

1369
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
maybe 90 plus percent.

1370
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
It's like in some way,

1371
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
like just any change at all.

1372
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
A lot.

1373
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I don't really know the number.

1374
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Cause it's,

1375
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
yeah,

1376
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
a lot.

1377
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It's,

1378
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
it's very rare that a skill receives no changes at all.

1379
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And sometimes they're like,

1380
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
they're just incidental changes,

1381
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
but you know,

1382
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
there's,

1383
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
there's stuff to be affected all over the place.

1384
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Uh,

1385
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
will there ever be an option to inspect in other players gear in the game,

1386
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
like in towns or in your party?

1387
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Possibly.

1388
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
This is something that we've,

1389
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
um,

1390
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
we've,

1391
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
we've definitely considered applying before.

1392
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Um,

1393
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
we came very close to introducing it a while ago.

1394
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Remember when we held back on it.

1395
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Maybe there may have just been like a,

1396
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
something that was stopping us from doing it.

1397
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The data is,

1398
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
the data is not synced.

1399
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So like that information doesn't exist on the player client right now.

1400
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So the,

1401
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,000
like,

1402
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
this isn't like,

1403
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
if you could like hack the game and like look inside the data that's

1404
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
floating around inside your client,

1405
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,000
um,

1406
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
that information is just not there.

1407
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,000
When,

1408
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
when another player joins your game,

1409
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
the information that gets synced over is the visuals.

1410
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So it just says like you,

1411
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,000
like,

1412
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh,

1413
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
this person's wearing MTX.

1414
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Okay.

1415
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
That MTX is what gets sent over.

1416
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And we just,

1417
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
we just know they're wearing that MTX and we have no idea what's

1418
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
underneath it at all from like,

1419
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,000
if,

1420
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
if I was playing with someone else,

1421
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
my clock,

1422
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
my game client wouldn't know what they're wearing,

1423
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
what gear they're wearing.

1424
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It would just know what it looks like.

1425
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Um,

1426
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and if it's got a cosmetic over top of it,

1427
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
it doesn't even know the base type at all.

1428
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Um,

1429
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
so,

1430
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,000
you know,

1431
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,000
it's,

1432
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
it's one of those things like it's more information to sync.

1433
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's,

1434
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
that's a performance cost.

1435
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Um,

1436
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
it's not that much information.

1437
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It's not that much of a performance cost really.

1438
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Um,

1439
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
but it's all stuff we've got to consider.

1440
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
More questions.

1441
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Keep them coming.

1442
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Loving them.

1443
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Loving them.

1444
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
All right.

1445
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Will there ever be cold conversion option for someone bear?

1446
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Ah,

1447
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
a polar bear skin would be amazing.

1448
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
So there is a white bear you can get with Kermode's cage,

1449
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,000
uh,

1450
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,000
as a,

1451
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
as a armor piece that does change it to look like a polar bear.

1452
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Um,

1453
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
but it's different.

1454
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It's not actually a polar bear.

1455
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It's like a,

1456
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
it's a different species.

1457
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Anyways,

1458
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,000
it doesn't,

1459
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
it doesn't matter.

1460
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Um,

1461
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Oh,

1462
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
yep.

1463
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Um,

1464
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I'm getting reminded that they're asking about summon bear and not where bear,

1465
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
because I know this game.

1466
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Well,

1467
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
thanks gain.

1468
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Um,

1469
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I,

1470
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I think there's a decent chance that we'll have a,

1471
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
uh,

1472
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
MTX for a polar bear,

1473
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
not a functional cold alternative.

1474
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Um,

1475
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
but it's possible.

1476
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
The,

1477
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,000
the,

1478
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
the cold theming and saber tooth is very strong.

1479
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Um,

1480
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I would,

1481
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I would say more likely for a visuals and,

1482
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
but possible for a functional as well.

1483
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Not in season two.

1484
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Sorry.

1485
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Uh,

1486
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,000
right.

1487
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Have you seen any feedback?

1488
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Probably.

1489
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Regarding melee versus range in Ellie from content creators.

1490
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Like,

1491
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,000
yes,

1492
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,000
uh,

1493
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Gazi,

1494
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,000
dread current.

1495
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Uh,

1496
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
do you guys have any thoughts on feedback that current age?

1497
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
She plans for balancing melee versus range is not enough.

1498
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Like current age,

1499
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,000
she plans for balancing.

1500
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's not enough.

1501
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I mean,

1502
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,000
if they're,

1503
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
if they're,

1504
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,000
uh,

1505
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:21,000
sharing,

1506
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
they don't think what we've done from,

1507
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
the CT program is not enough.

1508
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Um,

1509
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
then they're breaking their NDAs.

1510
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Um,

1511
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I would assume maybe,

1512
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,000
maybe not.

1513
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
They don't understand how that works,

1514
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
but,

1515
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
uh,

1516
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I,

1517
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I have read lots of feedback around specific thoughts people have on the current version of,

1518
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
of melee versus range.

1519
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Um,

1520
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
there are,

1521
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
we're,

1522
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,000
we're,

1523
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
we're continuing to leverage and leveraging more so than before the ability for,

1524
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
um,

1525
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,000
enemies,

1526
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
especially specifically bosses.

1527
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's the most important place that it appears in.

1528
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It's,

1529
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
it's definitely less of a big issue.

1530
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I think on trash than it is on bosses.

1531
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Um,

1532
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
and it's definitely most prominently a big deal at like hyper end game stuff where you're like min maxing to the top.

1533
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And,

1534
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
uh,

1535
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,000
we are,

1536
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
we are leveraging,

1537
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
especially with new boss encounters.

1538
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Um,

1539
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
so abilities have,

1540
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
uh,

1541
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
every ability in the game in last Epoch has,

1542
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,000
uh,

1543
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
several range values associated with it.

1544
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I've talked about these range values before,

1545
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
but there's like,

1546
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
there's a minimum engage range,

1547
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
um,

1548
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
a minimum pursuit range,

1549
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
uh,

1550
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
a minimum use range and a minimum,

1551
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
uh,

1552
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and a maximum use range as well.

1553
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Um,

1554
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,000
all right.

1555
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Max.

1556
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yep.

1557
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Sorry.

1558
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
A maximum pers.

1559
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Oh,

1560
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I can't roll in titles that we use,

1561
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
we use different terms for them on the backend,

1562
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
but the,

1563
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,000
uh,

1564
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
the point is,

1565
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,000
is that there are,

1566
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
you can set an ability to only function if a player is a minimum distance from the,

1567
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
uh,

1568
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
from the minion or enemy or any AI is running their things.

1569
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Minions and enemies use the same AI functions.

1570
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Um,

1571
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
and so the,

1572
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
there's certain abilities that we've put in boss fights,

1573
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
especially new boss fights where they will only trigger if they're on,

1574
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,000
uh,

1575
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
like on a range character and you're,

1576
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
you're playing at range.

1577
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And so there's certain things that was like trigger more often,

1578
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
or if it's like,

1579
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
maybe it's an ability that uses that has like a windup to use.

1580
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And if you're standing really far away,

1581
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
maybe that windup,

1582
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
it'll use a different version of it.

1583
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So if you're like,

1584
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
let's,

1585
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,000
let's,

1586
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
let's pray my minions,

1587
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
keep me alive.

1588
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And if you are like within this ring of the enemy,

1589
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
let's use this enemy.

1590
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Let's bring side of this as the example.

1591
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So this is your,

1592
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
this is your enemy and you're within this ring.

1593
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
The ability that it uses,

1594
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
it has like a one second charge up time before it slams in a,

1595
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
in a space where it's like going to target a target to you with a slam and you have a second to move.

1596
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But if you're outside of that ring,

1597
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
like if you're,

1598
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,000
if you're out,

1599
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
if you're out here and it targets you and it targets a box,

1600
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
it only gives you half a second to move or something like that.

1601
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So you,

1602
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
it makes it harder to dodge when you're farther away.

1603
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Um,

1604
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and we'll do,

1605
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
we'll do things like that more than we're doing it now.

1606
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So sometimes it's in the enemy behavior that we're changing that to,

1607
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
uh,

1608
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
to make being in melee a little bit functionally easier,

1609
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
a little bit mechanically easier,

1610
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
or more so that we're making being at range a little bit more mechanically difficult.

1611
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,000
All right.

1612
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
From your perspective,

1613
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
what are the top three to five gameplay improvements from season one to season two?

1614
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Ah,

1615
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,000
oof.

1616
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Gameplay.

1617
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Um,

1618
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
the weaver's tree.

1619
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Number one.

1620
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Um,

1621
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
controllers,

1622
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,000
controller functionality,

1623
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
just in general,

1624
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,000
how you,

1625
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
how you control,

1626
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I'll put movement controls in one thing.

1627
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So controller and was the options.

1628
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Um,

1629
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
biggest things.

1630
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm kind of,

1631
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I'm,

1632
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I'm batching too broad of stuff together.

1633
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I think,

1634
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,000
uh,

1635
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,000
the,

1636
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
can't say that one.

1637
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Uh,

1638
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
what can I say?

1639
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Can I say?

1640
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
There's,

1641
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
there's just like two that we haven't like really talked about yet that I want to say,

1642
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
but I can't.

1643
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Um,

1644
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
and then I just get fixated on those in my brain and I can't think of other things.

1645
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Um,

1646
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:59,000
probably the improvements to,

1647
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
uh,

1648
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I,

1649
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I think it's the improvements to some of the faction stuff.

1650
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I think that'd be the next big thing.

1651
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But like individual skill things is,

1652
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
is probably the main thing,

1653
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
like specific skills that had functionality issues or new conversions that need,

1654
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
that got added in.

1655
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Um,

1656
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
just like better targeting in general.

1657
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Health.

1658
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Lovely.

1659
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Right.

1660
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,000
It's not over.

1661
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I want my stuff when you get back.

1662
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Uh,

1663
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,000
right.

1664
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
As a casual player data too,

1665
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I tend to play COF.

1666
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
What improvements have I made to make a viable versus SSF?

1667
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Uh,

1668
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,000
um,

1669
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
um,

1670
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,000
what improvements have been made to make this viable versus SSF?

1671
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Well,

1672
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
you,

1673
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,000
you,

1674
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
you can play COF as SSF.

1675
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So I think,

1676
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,000
uh,

1677
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
it was meant to be versus merchant skill possibly.

1678
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Um,

1679
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
merchant skill is,

1680
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I mean,

1681
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
unless we,

1682
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
unless we take COF and we're like,

1683
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,000
all right,

1684
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
gear rains from the sky and you can just like pick your gear from a dropdown menu.

1685
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Like it's merchant skill is almost always going to be,

1686
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I think inherently stronger.

1687
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And I don't think there's a way we can make COF feel good to play and have it be,

1688
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
uh,

1689
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
directly competing power wise with merchant skill to the same degree.

1690
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
We can get close.

1691
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
We can get very close,

1692
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I think.

1693
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And we are,

1694
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,000
um,

1695
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
we are working to improve that to get it closer.

1696
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Um,

1697
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
and I think the big thing is,

1698
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,000
um,

1699
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,000
the,

1700
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,000
we're,

1701
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
we're relieving some of the pressure on lenses.

1702
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Um,

1703
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
because there's a few lenses people just like,

1704
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,000
well,

1705
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,000
we,

1706
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
you have to play with this lens or else it just sucks.

1707
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And so we're like,

1708
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,000
okay,

1709
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,000
well,

1710
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
if it just sucks to not play with that lens,

1711
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
we're just going to make that lens exist all the time.

1712
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Um,

1713
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
and so we're,

1714
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
we're relieving some pressure with lenses.

1715
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I think that's going to be the biggest thing.

1716
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Um,

1717
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
also just tweaking some numbers,

1718
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
just like making things cost a little bit less favor,

1719
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,000
uh,

1720
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
making them drop a few better things.

1721
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Um,

1722
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and then the way that those interact with the weaver's tree stuff and the new crafting options is going to be a big, big thing as well.

1723
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I see.

1724
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Well,

1725
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
we have some kind of socketing mechanism mechanics,

1726
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,000
not runeword,

1727
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
more like some kind of power customization.

1728
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Also,

1729
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I heard about idol crafting.

1730
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah.

1731
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So the socketing is a tricky thing.

1732
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It's one of the things that we've,

1733
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,000
we've,

1734
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
we love socketings,

1735
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,000
the,

1736
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,000
the,

1737
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
the theming and the feel and the vibe behind socketing.

1738
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Like it's fantastic.

1739
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I was not,

1740
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I haven't coughed in like two days and like stream started.

1741
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I'm like,

1742
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,000
all right,

1743
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
time to start coughing.

1744
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,000
All right.

1745
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Our crafting system,

1746
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
like here's an empty socket.

1747
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I'm gonna put something in that socket.

1748
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I probably should have put something better next.

1749
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It's actually kind of decent boost to start with.

1750
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Oh,

1751
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
well,

1752
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,000
um,

1753
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
we've considered socketing in a few different ways.

1754
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And I actually regret putting that in.

1755
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Oh God.

1756
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,000
No.

1757
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,000
All right.

1758
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Vitality,

1759
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
leave it.

1760
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Um,

1761
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
let's try and seal something.

1762
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Let's seal,

1763
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
let's,

1764
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
let's try and seal the vitality.

1765
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
All right,

1766
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,000
good.

1767
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Great.

1768
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Oh,

1769
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
we ran out of 40 potential.

1770
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,000
That's fine.

1771
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Um,

1772
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
my point is that this,

1773
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,000
the,

1774
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
the socketing,

1775
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
um,

1776
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
our current crafting system is very similar to the socketing as a system.

1777
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Um,

1778
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,000
and it's tricky to kind of separate the two and,

1779
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,000
and,

1780
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and have them work,

1781
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
side by side,

1782
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,000
side by side.

1783
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Um,

1784
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I think there's room for a socketing system in the future.

1785
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I think it would be kind of its own system.

1786
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And the things that would fit in there would be unique to that system.

1787
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So it would,

1788
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
um,

1789
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I,

1790
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I don't,

1791
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I don't know what sort of things,

1792
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,000
but they would be,

1793
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I think the things that would go in a socket system would need to be,

1794
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,000
uh,

1795
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
distinct from the affix system.

1796
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So it would have to be like,

1797
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I don't know.

1798
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Okay.

1799
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Okay.

1800
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Here's kind of the style of thing.

1801
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,000
We're not,

1802
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
obviously not doing this,

1803
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
but similar to how,

1804
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,000
um,

1805
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Peewee one puts the skill gems as sockets into the gear where those are separate from the

1806
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
affixes themselves for the most part.

1807
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And I,

1808
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I think that that would be the style of thing that we'd be more interested in putting in a

1809
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
socketing system than,

1810
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
uh,

1811
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
more of a classic,

1812
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
like a Ruby gives you fire damage type socketing system.

1813
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Also,

1814
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I heard about idle crafting.

1815
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Yes.

1816
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Um,

1817
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
there is a,

1818
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
one of the rewards for one of the woven echoes.

1819
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Uh,

1820
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
nope.

1821
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
One of the rewards for,

1822
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
one of the rewards,

1823
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,000
the new content,

1824
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
uh,

1825
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
gives you,

1826
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
or gives you the ability to select,

1827
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,000
uh,

1828
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
enchantments from,

1829
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,000
uh,

1830
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
a fixed list for,

1831
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
uh,

1832
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
for new,

1833
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
uh,

1834
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
for new affixes that can be added to idols.

1835
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Uh,

1836
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
they can only be added to set,

1837
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
or not set,

1838
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,000
um,

1839
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
class specific idols.

1840
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Um,

1841
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
so the,

1842
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
the three,

1843
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,000
uh,

1844
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
three and four size idols.

1845
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And,

1846
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,000
um,

1847
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,000
so that,

1848
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
that is re-rollable as well.

1849
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So you can just keep going until you get the one you want.

1850
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Uh,

1851
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
but it does cost a memory amber to re-roll more than it would,

1852
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,000
uh,

1853
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
for just the first one.

1854
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Um,

1855
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
we haven't really released a list of what those are going to be yet,

1856
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
but they're pretty great.

1857
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
All right.

1858
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Hi,

1859
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
a small question.

1860
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Will there be more stuff with portals of the past and future?

1861
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Because I like the concept of that.

1862
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah.

1863
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah.

1864
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Um,

1865
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
there's,

1866
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,000
there's,

1867
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I think it's more of that coming in future,

1868
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
uh,

1869
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
future seasons for the most part,

1870
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
like actually,

1871
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,000
uh,

1872
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
time traveling inside of a zone.

1873
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
There is a nod to our very first instance of that.

1874
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
We ever did something like that in,

1875
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
in season two though.

1876
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Uh,

1877
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
but so back in our Kickstarter,

1878
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
uh,

1879
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
the very first time the player time travels,

1880
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
uh,

1881
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
there was a specific event and there's a reference to that in the new,

1882
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
in the new season.

1883
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So if anyone played the original,

1884
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,000
uh,

1885
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
you'll see it there.

1886
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Uh,

1887
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
will there be new character models to choose from?

1888
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
In the character creation of season two?

1889
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
No character models are the same as they were in season one.

1890
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Um,

1891
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I think there's,

1892
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,000
there's a,

1893
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
there's a few,

1894
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,000
uh,

1895
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
a few tweaks on some of them,

1896
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
but like 99% the same.

1897
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That is still something we're interested in doing though.

1898
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Uh,

1899
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
have you guys ever considered a D2 style rune word crafting,

1900
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
uh,

1901
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
to the crafting system?

1902
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Uh,

1903
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
or do you feel the system suffice as it is?

1904
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,000
We,

1905
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
we,

1906
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
we've considered D2 rune word crafting since day one.

1907
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Absolutely.

1908
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Um,

1909
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I,

1910
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
D2 is,

1911
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
is like for several of us,

1912
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
possibly our most played game ever.

1913
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Uh,

1914
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I think for me,

1915
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
it might be,

1916
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,000
it's like,

1917
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
it's a toss up if,

1918
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
yeah,

1919
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,000
it's probably,

1920
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
it's probably that one,

1921
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
but you do it's probably my most played game ever.

1922
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Um,

1923
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
so yeah,

1924
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
everything I do,

1925
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I'm like,

1926
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
is this too much like D2?

1927
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Thank you very much.

1928
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Uh,

1929
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
real Ranger K for the five gifted subs.

1930
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I appreciate that.

1931
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So I hope everyone that,

1932
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,000
uh,

1933
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
got one of those appreciates it too.

1934
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Congrats.

1935
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Um,

1936
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,000
uh,

1937
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
D2 rune words.

1938
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
We've,

1939
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
there's a couple systems we've like put in,

1940
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
uh,

1941
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
trying to evoke the feeling of a D2 rune word system.

1942
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Um,

1943
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
and the legendary crafting system is one of those things that we've,

1944
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:48,000
we've kind of tried to pull in some of the vibes and feels from that style of system.

1945
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Um,

1946
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and the,

1947
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
the,

1948
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
the big thing there is that like,

1949
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
so with the D2 crafting system,

1950
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,000
with the D2,

1951
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
um,

1952
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,000
uh,

1953
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
rune word system,

1954
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
you're,

1955
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,000
you're collecting,

1956
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
uh,

1957
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
several disparate pieces of very rare things and you put them all together and you get something awesome.

1958
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Um,

1959
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
and,

1960
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
and that's kind of the vibe we're going for with the legendary craft.

1961
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So you get your,

1962
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,000
um,

1963
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
your like rare exalted item,

1964
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
you get your rare,

1965
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
um,

1966
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
unique item and you slot them together and you make something awesome.

1967
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Um,

1968
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and I know it's a very,

1969
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
very like tenuous connection at best.

1970
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Um,

1971
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
but that's like,

1972
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
that was definitely forefront of thought when we were making legendary system.

1973
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Um,

1974
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,000
and there's some,

1975
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I think there's some important distinctions between the season one legendary system and season two legendary system slash rune word system.

1976
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Um,

1977
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and we're going to be really excited to talk about those differences in,

1978
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
uh,

1979
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
on talking to tries podcast coming up in four days.

1980
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:54,000
28.

1981
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Yeah.

1982
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Four days.

1983
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Um,

1984
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
so if you want to hear about those tune into that,

1985
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
because we're talking itemization then very excited to talk about that.

1986
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I won't be there for that,

1987
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,000
but,

1988
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
uh,

1989
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
you'll have carve a Judd and Ross there and they are going to crush it.

1990
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Uh,

1991
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:24,000
do you think if there is any possibility to have competitive elements in last epoch or RPG in general on an e-sports level,

1992
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
if he has any insights on how this could look like,

1993
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,000
do you plan to do this?

1994
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
E-sports are,

1995
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
hmm,

1996
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I don't know of any e-sport level stuff that's not PVP.

1997
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Like,

1998
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
all the e-sports that like come to mind when I think of like a,

1999
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,000
the,

2000
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
like the really popular e-sports,

2001
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
they're all PVP.

2002
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Um,

2003
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,000
so I think,

2004
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I think you'd kind of have to have a PVP system for it.

2005
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And I think,

2006
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,000
um,

2007
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
all the big e-sport games that I think of quickly are,

2008
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,000
um,

2009
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
like,

2010
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
games that are like,

2011
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
they,

2012
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
they may have a campaign mode in the game,

2013
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,000
but like,

2014
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,000
it's,

2015
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,000
it's,

2016
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
it's a PVP game with,

2017
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,000
with,

2018
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,000
with a campaign.

2019
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
But it's a PVP game.

2020
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
You know,

2021
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,000
that sort of thing.

2022
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And so I,

2023
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I think that there's,

2024
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
um,

2025
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I,

2026
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I think because we've built the game in so many of the systems from,

2027
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
uh,

2028
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
the ground up as a,

2029
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,000
like,

2030
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
not as an e-sport to begin with,

2031
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and not as specifically a PVP game with a campaign,

2032
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,000
um,

2033
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,000
or with an,

2034
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,000
with a,

2035
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
like an end game style system.

2036
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I think it's hard to make,

2037
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I think it's really hard to make that transition into an e-sport space.

2038
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Um,

2039
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
like you almost have to like split the client and be like,

2040
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
here's the PVP client and here's the PVE client type of thing.

2041
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Um,

2042
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I do have some thoughts on,

2043
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
on different methods you could do there though.

2044
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And I would love to,

2045
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
to try some PVP elements.

2046
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Um,

2047
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
yeah.

2048
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Cause,

2049
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,000
cause like,

2050
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I think it's really easy to look at,

2051
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
uh,

2052
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
at last epoch and other RPGs.

2053
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And then look at like games like league of legends and Dota and,

2054
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
and other MOBAs and be like,

2055
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
you know,

2056
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
um,

2057
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
but it's,

2058
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I don't think it's quite that straightforward.

2059
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Yeah.

2060
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah.

2061
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Uh,

2062
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
when is shatter on freeze going to come?

2063
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Uh,

2064
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I think that's a season three thing.

2065
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Uh,

2066
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I know the emphasis is on season two,

2067
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
but new classes or masters for season three,

2068
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
maybe I'm,

2069
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I'm really,

2070
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I don't want to talk about season three's potential stuff.

2071
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Um,

2072
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
mostly cause I don't know much of it.

2073
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Cause we haven't decided on much of it.

2074
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
We're really focused on season two.

2075
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
There's like some key elements we know are coming for season,

2076
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
season three and stuff like that.

2077
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And there's like a few,

2078
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
a few projects that are spun up,

2079
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
but like we're really focusing on season two stuff right now.

2080
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Love the game.

2081
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Thank you.

2082
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Me too.

2083
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Uh,

2084
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
but awesome often feels like the sound effects are either a little hollow.

2085
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Are there any changes planned to increase the base or screen shake on large

2086
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
impacts?

2087
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Um,

2088
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,000
what we do like,

2089
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I don't know.

2090
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
It's possible that you may not have this,

2091
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,000
the,

2092
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
the screen shake settings cranked up.

2093
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
If you want more of those,

2094
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
there is more of that.

2095
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Um,

2096
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
so there's like heavy abilities only and most abilities.

2097
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Um,

2098
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
and the screen shake intensity,

2099
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
you can crank that up pretty high.

2100
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Like we,

2101
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
we can,

2102
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I,

2103
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
uh,

2104
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,000
that's,

2105
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
that's,

2106
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
that's a lot of screen shake.

2107
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Um,

2108
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
we do have,

2109
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,000
there's like,

2110
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
there's always a ton of sound effects updates coming.

2111
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Yes.

2112
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
There's lots of sound effects.

2113
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It's coming.

2114
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I think now's a good time.

2115
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Um,

2116
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
let's,

2117
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I'm sorry.

2118
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
It took me so long.

2119
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Here's,

2120
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
here's,

2121
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
here's a good little,

2122
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,000
little fun,

2123
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
little teaser.

2124
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
So,

2125
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,000
uh,

2126
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
there was a,

2127
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
a joke post that went out on April fool's day.

2128
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Um,

2129
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:17,000
and I'm very pleased to be able to actually confirm one little piece of that as

2130
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
something that is happening.

2131
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
We are getting an actual Capybara pet in the game.

2132
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
That was not a joke.

2133
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
It is real.

2134
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,000
It's coming.

2135
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Yeah.

2136
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
All the posts of like,

2137
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,000
ah,

2138
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
you got to like add it in quickly.

2139
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I'm like,

2140
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
it's already added.

2141
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:47,000
All right.

2142
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Uh,

2143
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
you were talking about sound effects on skills.

2144
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Uh,

2145
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
any plans to tune down amount of time?

2146
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,000
A tune says,

2147
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I cannot do that yet.

2148
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Is the audio playing for it?

2149
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Uh,

2150
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
it is like,

2151
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
that's great.

2152
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Okay.

2153
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,000
We're going to,

2154
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
we're going to take that down.

2155
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Uh,

2156
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
all right.

2157
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Uh,

2158
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
love loot lizards.

2159
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I understand you are reducing their frequency.

2160
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Is it going to be to boost them in the new web?

2161
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yes,

2162
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
there are several ways to boost them in the new web,

2163
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
actually.

2164
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Oh,

2165
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
oh heck we're doing,

2166
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
we're doing back to backs.

2167
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
He didn't even warn me.

2168
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
This was coming.

2169
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I didn't even,

2170
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I didn't even look ahead for it,

2171
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
but we're doing back to backs.

2172
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Here we go.

2173
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Uh,

2174
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
so yes,

2175
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
there are ways in the weaver's tree in order to boost the number of

2176
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
loot lizards you will find.

2177
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Um,

2178
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and,

2179
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
uh,

2180
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,000
they,

2181
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
they do.

2182
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,000
So yes,

2183
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
while we are reducing the,

2184
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,000
um,

2185
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
the quantity of loot lizards that appear,

2186
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and we are also reducing the quantity of items that loot lizards drop at

2187
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
base.

2188
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
We are increasing the quality of items that they drop.

2189
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,000
So they,

2190
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
they still drop a lot of stuff and it's still really awesome.

2191
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Um,

2192
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
but it's a little less like,

2193
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
oh my God,

2194
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
the screen is full,

2195
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
uh,

2196
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,000
situations.

2197
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
It can still happen if you get like propagating,

2198
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
uh,

2199
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
like when there's a chance when,

2200
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,000
when you,

2201
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
um,

2202
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
defeat one of them and,

2203
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,000
uh,

2204
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
two more spawn or three more spawn.

2205
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And so like that can still happen.

2206
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
So you can get situations where a lot happens,

2207
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,000
uh,

2208
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
but it's a little less intense than it was before.

2209
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
All right.

2210
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Uh,

2211
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
so Sentinel's getting a rework.

2212
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Is shaman and all the other masters missing their fifth skill going to get

2213
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
their fifth skill at all?

2214
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Um,

2215
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
yeah.

2216
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,000
So we're not,

2217
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
uh,

2218
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,000
yes.

2219
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
The short answer is,

2220
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,000
is yeah,

2221
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
we're still,

2222
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
we're still getting skills for other classes.

2223
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Um,

2224
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
hang on.

2225
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It's,

2226
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
it's marksman.

2227
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Oh no,

2228
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
it's marksman's getting it.

2229
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It's,

2230
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
uh,

2231
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
it's blade dancer,

2232
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:06,000
shaman,

2233
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:07,000
paladin,

2234
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
and lich.

2235
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I think it's those four.

2236
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Um,

2237
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,000
and we've got,

2238
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
and then,

2239
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,000
uh,

2240
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
and then also base rogue is missing too,

2241
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I think.

2242
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Um,

2243
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
and so we've got some plans for some abilities to go into those spots.

2244
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Um,

2245
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I don't want to,

2246
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,000
uh,

2247
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
spoil which ones are gonna be happening first,

2248
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
but we are,

2249
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,000
uh,

2250
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
we are working on new abilities to fit into some of those.

2251
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Those slots.

2252
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And,

2253
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,000
uh,

2254
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
they are gonna be cool.

2255
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Primeless can use bows when,

2256
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,000
oh,

2257
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
when my dreams come true.

2258
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I don't,

2259
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I don't have a,

2260
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I don't have a fixed time for that.

2261
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

2262
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I really,

2263
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I really wish I could say like tomorrow.

2264
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Cause that's something I want so bad,

2265
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,000
but no,

2266
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I don't know.

2267
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Uh,

2268
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
what about dismemberment enemies melt on death,

2269
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:58,000
uh,

2270
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
when they are poisoned arrows stick to enemies.

2271
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Yeah.

2272
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Like,

2273
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
like just more gruesome death effects that are more specific to the situation that they're in.

2274
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Um,

2275
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,000
that's,

2276
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
that's all stuff we're working on.

2277
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Um,

2278
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I don't have any details or specifics on what's actually going to be possible or what's coming,

2279
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
but that style of stuff is stuff we're working on.

2280
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Uh,

2281
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
right.

2282
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
How many more acts,

2283
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
how many acts more when,

2284
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
how many acts more,

2285
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
when are we going to see them just for sense of game is finished?

2286
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Okay.

2287
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So,

2288
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,000
um,

2289
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
just to get a sense of how close we are to finishing the game,

2290
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
how many more acts are we going to get?

2291
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I think is what this question is asking.

2292
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Um,

2293
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
we're going to get three more chapters in the game.

2294
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Um,

2295
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,000
to,

2296
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
to round out the,

2297
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
the total chapters in the game.

2298
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Uh,

2299
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
could you share roughly the quantity of new uniques coming season two?

2300
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Are we talking 10,

2301
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,000
20,

2302
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,000
30?

2303
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I don't know.

2304
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Um,

2305
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and even if I did,

2306
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I'm not sure I'm allowed to say,

2307
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I'll say a,

2308
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,000
uh,

2309
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
sizable chunk in our,

2310
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
in our listing system,

2311
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
in our backend listing system is,

2312
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
is a few pages.

2313
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Uh,

2314
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
how big's a page?

2315
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I'll never tell.

2316
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
All right.

2317
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Are there any,

2318
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
any plans for more events similar to,

2319
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
uh,

2320
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Imperial uprising from last year on a more regular basis?

2321
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Um,

2322
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I think,

2323
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I think we're a little hesitant to,

2324
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
to do too many more of those.

2325
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Um,

2326
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
it's definitely possible,

2327
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
but it's not something that I would,

2328
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
uh,

2329
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
expect very soon.

2330
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Like,

2331
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,000
granted,

2332
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
it was just the first one we'd ever done.

2333
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
And the,

2334
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
the,

2335
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,000
um,

2336
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
the response wasn't as,

2337
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
uh,

2338
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
like significantly,

2339
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
like,

2340
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
like just strictly looking at,

2341
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,000
uh,

2342
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
a numbers perspective of like player counts.

2343
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Like you can go,

2344
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
go look at steam tracks and look at when it came out.

2345
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And,

2346
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
um,

2347
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
like,

2348
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
it didn't seem like it resonated to,

2349
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,000
to,

2350
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
uh,

2351
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,000
highly.

2352
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
From that.

2353
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I don't actually know the numbers were on like our backend numbers,

2354
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
but if I'm looking at it from that perspective,

2355
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
that's where I'm seeing the things.

2356
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,000
All right.

2357
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Have you thought of a very rare rune that returns stability?

2358
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Yes.

2359
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Many times.

2360
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
This gets suggested frequently.

2361
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Uh,

2362
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
it is something we have debated heavily.

2363
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
It is something that we have very conclusively decided that we are not

2364
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
interested in doing at this time.

2365
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Uh,

2366
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
perhaps a question a team won't like much.

2367
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I love all questions.

2368
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
That's not true.

2369
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I love most questions.

2370
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Um,

2371
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
what has been done about performance from 1.1 to 1.2?

2372
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,000
A ton of stuff.

2373
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Uh,

2374
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
it's been the same unreliable experience for all my friends,

2375
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
really unstable FPS and mono as well.

2376
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I will say that,

2377
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,000
um,

2378
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
the vast majority of players that we've heard feedback from the frame rates in

2379
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
general and stability in general and performance has improved very

2380
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
significantly.

2381
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Um,

2382
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
over the course of the time we've,

2383
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
we've had this up and,

2384
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
um,

2385
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
like I am not running this on a super powerful computer.

2386
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I'm running it on fairly high specs,

2387
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
uh,

2388
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
the game while streaming it.

2389
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
And this is not,

2390
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
uh,

2391
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,000
this is,

2392
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
this is not a crazy computer that I'm running this on at all.

2393
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
This is a,

2394
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I don't know if I can bring this up without showing some extra info that I

2395
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,000
don't want to show,

2396
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,000
but like,

2397
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
this is a,

2398
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
like an I seven,

2399
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
uh,

2400
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
12 something,

2401
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,000
12,

2402
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
700 K or something.

2403
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Uh,

2404
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
and like,

2405
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I think I'm running,

2406
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,000
it's a 40,

2407
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,000
60.

2408
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I think it's a 40,

2409
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,000
60.

2410
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Um,

2411
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,000
no,

2412
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,000
it's a 30,

2413
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
60.

2414
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,000
It's not even a 40,

2415
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,000
60.

2416
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
It's a 30,

2417
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:56,000
60.

2418
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Yeah.

2419
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Like this,

2420
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,000
this is,

2421
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
this is not a,

2422
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I'm going to bring this up here.

2423
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,000
30,

2424
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:12,000
60 TI.

2425
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Um,

2426
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
and like,

2427
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
we are butter smooth here.

2428
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I don't know.

2429
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I,

2430
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I never noticed issues like that.

2431
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
And so I don't,

2432
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,000
um,

2433
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I think from,

2434
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,000
from,

2435
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,000
like,

2436
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
anecdotal answers of like,

2437
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Hey,

2438
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
it works really well for me.

2439
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Aren't useful.

2440
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
And so I'm not trying to suggest that,

2441
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
but I'm just trying to suggest that it's,

2442
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,000
um,

2443
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
we are working very heavily.

2444
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Performance is one of the most important things for us.

2445
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Uh,

2446
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
multiplayer performance,

2447
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
server stability,

2448
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
uh,

2449
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
game integrity,

2450
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
uh,

2451
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
just like FPS in general.

2452
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Like those,

2453
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,000
these,

2454
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
these are the main things when we're,

2455
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
when we're deciding like what's the most important stuff to work on,

2456
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
where are we going to put the people who are really,

2457
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
uh,

2458
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
tackling the tough issues going to go like that.

2459
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,000
That's where,

2460
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
that's where it all happens.

2461
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
So it's extremely,

2462
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,000
extremely important.

2463
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Um,

2464
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and I guess what I'm just trying to say is that I think we've really

2465
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
improved a lot in that category over the last few years.

2466
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Um,

2467
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
and it's just going to get better and better and better.

2468
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Uh,

2469
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
every chance we get to,

2470
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
to reclaim some frames wherever we can,

2471
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
we take them.

2472
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:25,000
get him out of the corner.

2473
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Um,

2474
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:25,000
get him out of the corner.

2475
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:39,000
it might be okay.

2476
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Alright, will we ever have the final slam craft like Orb of Corruption in PoE?

2477
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Yeah, that's the sort of thing we have looked at a few times.

2478
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I mean, creating a legendary kind of is that, right?

2479
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Can we sustain through this?

2480
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Yes!

2481
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:32,000
With Berserk going, we definitely can!

2482
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Go Berserk, go!

2483
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
God's emperors are nothing possible!

2484
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Got him!

2485
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Am I free?

2486
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Sure.

2487
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Sure.

2488
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
But yeah, sorry, I had to focus there a little bit to actually do that.

2489
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:02,000
As far as an extra slam craft thing like that, like a universal object that can be slammed into anything,

2490
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
you've run out of forging potential and you're like, one more try.

2491
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Boom, does something random and wild.

2492
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Yeah, that's something that we are considering as an option, not season two.

2493
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Will champion affixes be applied to items randomly or with some class restriction?

2494
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I ask because the tease video, Rogue Helmet appeared to have a champion affix of plus one for companions, for example.

2495
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Yeah, that was, there were some conflicting things in the video that will not be conflicting when the game launches.

2496
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
So yeah, if it doesn't make sense in that video, it won't be there in the end.

2497
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
We fixed all those.

2498
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Will stash tabs ever be able to carry over between seasons like actual stash themselves, not the items?

2499
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I think it's unlikely.

2500
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I think it's possible that we could carry over the layouts and you still have to buy new ones, but they'd auto-pocket the layouts.

2501
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
That's what I really wanted to do. That would be my goal for the next thing for stashes is to be able to move the layouts over.

2502
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
So that when you like, you start the next one up and you're like, okay, buy a new tab.

2503
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And it just auto goes and says, okay, I know this tab was going to be the, my set item tab or whatever.

2504
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And you've already got the labels there or have them be there, but have them be non-functional until you buy them.

2505
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
So like the tabs exist, but they're like a phantom mode.

2506
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And then you're like, okay, well, I need my unique tabs.

2507
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
You buy your unique tab and it like it's already in place and everything like that.

2508
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
But you can't use it until you buy that specific tab.

2509
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
That might, that would probably be the best way to do it.

2510
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I hadn't even considered that until right now.

2511
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
How do you feel about the stability of the market in season two?

2512
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I think it's going to be a lot better.

2513
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
It's gonna be a lot better.

2514
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I think we're going to see less inflation.

2515
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Yeah, because of reasons.

2516
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I'm definitely allowed to say right now, but I'm just choosing.

2517
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,000
No, I'm not allowed to say.

2518
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I'm sorry.

2519
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Anyway, any chance we will see prophecies give more than just one LP items getting the occasional two or three rare LP prophecy would be fantastic.

2520
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I'm not sure if we've changed this, but I will say that there are new things that will make getting one LP rewards feel a lot better.

2521
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And tune in to talk to tries podcast on the eighth to find out more information about that in four days.

2522
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Any chance you will officially support Linux at some point?

2523
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
We do officially support Linux.

2524
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:55,000
And I realize as I'm saying that there's probably a technicality that I don't understand that means we don't actually officially support Linux question mark.

2525
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
But I'm pretty sure we have a Linux client.

2526
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Question mark.

2527
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Oh, we don't.

2528
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Okay.

2529
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Okay.

2530
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Okay.

2531
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Okay.

2532
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Okay.

2533
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Okay.

2534
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Okay.

2535
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Okay.

2536
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Okay.

2537
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Oh, sorry.

2538
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I forgot.

2539
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Thank you.

2540
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I forgot we switched to the proton only version.

2541
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I have no idea if it's coming back.

2542
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
We used to have, we used to have a Linux specific client, right?

2543
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I forgot we switched over to proton.

2544
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Uh, I think that was done because we were just getting so much better performance out of the proton version on Linux.

2545
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
But, um...

2546
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I'm not sure.

2547
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
If there's a really good reason to, I'd say it's a reasonable thing to ask for.

2548
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Um...

2549
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Like if we can get better performance out of it, that's, I'd be looking forward to that.

2550
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
We got more subs!

2551
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Lone Star McFluffin has come with a rating party.

2552
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Welcome.

2553
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Oh, I missed a sub a while ago.

2554
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
7.04.

2555
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Thank you very much.

2556
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Appreciate you.

2557
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Appreciate you subbing.

2558
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Welcome everyone from Lone Star Stream.

2559
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I was gonna, I was gonna raid you after this.

2560
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
That was my plan.

2561
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I saw you streaming.

2562
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I was gonna, I was gonna raid you.

2563
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
But I guess you're done.

2564
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I'm sorry.

2565
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Um...

2566
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Any information on API webhook integrations for developers?

2567
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I really can't wait to get a hold of that stuff.

2568
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Um, I don't have any updates for you.

2569
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I think there's, there's sort of a couple things that people are really hoping for.

2570
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Like, oh, I can't wait to get my hands on the API to do this.

2571
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And I'm like, the API doesn't do that.

2572
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Um, so just to be clear, the API that we do have, that is, is currently in like an early access

2573
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
state for people to test out for us.

2574
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Um, there's, there's no like item information.

2575
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
So you can't be like, hey API, tell me all of the tiers of values for all the tiers of

2576
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
intelligence that can go on items.

2577
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:09,000
It just won't.

2578
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
That information is just not there.

2579
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
So like the game data itself doesn't exist on it.

2580
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
So if you're waiting for it for that, don't hold your breath on that one.

2581
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Oh, the new spires.

2582
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I can't wait for the new spires.

2583
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
There's, there's the answer to that question earlier about the new mechanical gameplay stuff

2584
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
that changes the new spires.

2585
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
That's my answer.

2586
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
So much better.

2587
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So much more fun.

2588
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Oh, and the procedural content generation.

2589
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Oh my God.

2590
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
How did I forget about that?

2591
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Do you actually know who the very first person was that downloaded your game?

2592
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
No, not even sure if you can find that out.

2593
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I don't know who it was.

2594
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I'm sorry.

2595
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
We probably could find out who the first person to back us on Kickstarter was, who would be the

2596
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
first person to like pay for the game that we could probably figure out.

2597
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I could probably figure that out on my own.

2598
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Oh, that's a lot of messages there.

2599
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Oh, yeah.

2600
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I'm streaming, bud.

2601
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I'm sorry.

2602
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm not answering you right now.

2603
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
All right.

2604
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I am really far.

2605
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I'm an hour behind in questions.

2606
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Oh my goodness.

2607
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Okay.

2608
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Here's what we're doing.

2609
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
We are.

2610
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
We're going to put a little teaser out.

2611
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:48,000
It's flashy and I'm going to answer a bunch of questions.

2612
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Here is a new cosmetic for Frostclaw.

2613
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
And we're going to rapid fire some questions here so we can get some of these out of the way.

2614
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So we're going to do quick answers only.

2615
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Any changes to Nemesis Egg System, like more rare affixes more easily to get not able to find them in

2616
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
every echo.

2617
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
No major changes there.

2618
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Why do I need to kill Harbinger to get the boss timeline item reward?

2619
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Why not get the rewards after each kill?

2620
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
It needs to so you don't leave halfway through, I guess.

2621
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,000
All right.

2622
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Is there any private leagues planned for the future?

2623
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Vaguely, maybe nothing specific.

2624
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
For COF, what are your thoughts on increasing the quality of items?

2625
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Quality of items, more crafting potential, higher LP chances.

2626
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And reducing the quantity to make it easier to manage stash wise.

2627
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I mean...

2628
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I think this is kind of a like...

2629
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Like tighten up the loot filter is the answer.

2630
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
It's not the great answer there.

2631
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
There's definitely some...

2632
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I think there's more...

2633
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Given the new crafting item options available, there's going to be new items that you're going to be

2634
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
interested in picking up that you're going to want to see.

2635
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
That you're not going to want us to take away.

2636
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
But you'll be actually like processing them.

2637
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
And when they either succeed or fail, you'll be getting rid of them, I think.

2638
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Hey again, Mike.

2639
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Hello.

2640
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Welcome back.

2641
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Would it be possible to reveal or speak a bit more about that system you guys hinted at in Reddit for

2642
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
not having to feel bad when missing LP slams that are very rare to get?

2643
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Tune in.

2644
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Talk to Tri's podcast on the 8th.

2645
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
We'll be talking about it there.

2646
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
All these itemization questions that we're saving for that podcast and it's going to be

2647
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
juicy ones.

2648
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I'm really excited for it.

2649
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
All right.

2650
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Hey, Mike and the team.

2651
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Hello.

2652
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Is there anything among the leaks that you have prepared for the season two that the

2653
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
players are kind of overlooking when you thought we'd be super hyped about or anything that we

2654
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
are fixating too much on?

2655
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Well, you thought it wouldn't be too much of a deal.

2656
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I think the response has been pretty appropriate, especially the one thing that I would say that

2657
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I had said the answer to this question before was the imprinting in the in the weaver tree.

2658
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So here's something interesting we can actually see now.

2659
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
You can see all six of the nodes.

2660
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
The picture is tiny on my screen.

2661
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:38,000
You can see all six of the nodes that all six of the imprint slots that are there.

2662
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So there are six imprint slots that you can see.

2663
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
That's something that I thought people were kind of sleeping on, but it was so there was no information

2664
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:45,000
on it.

2665
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
It was kind of like a vaguely what is this?

2666
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And so I think I think this is going to be a really big.

2667
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
It's going to be really cool.

2668
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And there's different there's different conditions to be met for different imprinting slots.

2669
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
So some of them will I don't want to give away what all of them are right now, but there are

2670
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:11,000
there's different ways that the imprinting can trigger and different conditions on what you can

2671
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
imprint in each of those slots as well.

2672
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And you'll notice that some of the different physical sizes that will tell you a little bit about

2673
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
the type of things can go in those slots more.

2674
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,000
All right.

2675
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I took a look at the pebble set since you mentioned it, and I think I can make an epic build, but I think

2676
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
you should add an incentive like maybe featuring a Terra monthly thoughts.

2677
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Ah, you want me you want us to tell you we're going to feature the build in a Terra monthly.

2678
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I mean, send us the build and we're always we're always looking out for cool builds there.

2679
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:55,000
If you've got a sweet one that is a little out of the box and a little a little wacky,

2680
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
those those fit in there very nicely.

2681
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Uh, hi.

2682
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Hello.

2683
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
What do you think about a player retention for season one?

2684
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And what do you think it'll be the same for season two lower better and why I think we'd be much better

2685
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
because we've got a lot more end game content and a lot.

2686
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I think a lot better.

2687
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Uh, curve for

2688
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
uh, fun, a little fun curve.

2689
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I don't know how to how to describe that, but I think there's just there's better.

2690
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
There's there's more steps along the way where you can really

2691
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
like incentivize specific things.

2692
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Yeah.

2693
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
All right.

2694
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
When balancing the campaign, do you balance for homebrew builds or is the balance around the net

2695
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
meta builds?

2696
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I think we expect with the campaign, we expect meta builds to push significantly above their

2697
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
um, their level.

2698
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
So we, when we're, when we're looking at the campaign balancing, we're like, okay,

2699
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
if this is a level 10 zone and there's 11 level 10 player here with a homebrew build and a level

2700
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
five player here with a meta build, um, it's going to make a lot of sense.

2701
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
And so that's kind of how we look at it.

2702
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I think.

2703
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Uh, hello, Mike.

2704
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Will there be cosmetics offline?

2705
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Possibly.

2706
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I not in season two though.

2707
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Uh, can you explain how the woven echoes items like X snapshot nodes work more specifically when it procs?

2708
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Does it always drop items exactly like the snapshot

2709
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,000
it showed a note or does it create a subset of base plus affixes and you need to get lucky with a well-rolled item?

2710
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Um, yeah, so it

2711
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
it's got a lot of different.

2712
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
It's almost, almost never exactly the same.

2713
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
It is technically possible for it to drop exactly the same, but I, the odds are astronomical.

2714
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Um, so it's going to be similar.

2715
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
So there's, um, sometimes it'll be as simple as just like one affix basically gets chaos.

2716
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Or, uh, it might be a simple, it might be like, um, like the base type actually changes or like

2717
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
basically anything on the item can change.

2718
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Um, but it tries to keep them relatively similar.

2719
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
So you'll see, I think what you'll be wanting to do is you'll be like, okay,

2720
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
here's an item that's like really close to what I'm looking for, but it's not quite right.

2721
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
It's like, it's pretty sweet, but like, I want something a little bit better.

2722
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And you put that in there and then, um, it, it procs a few times and you're getting items that are really similar and you get one that's just like, that's similar.

2723
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
And it's got what you want, uh, everything that was good about the old one, but then it's even better in some other way.

2724
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
And you, so you switch that into the new one that you're, that you're imprinting.

2725
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And then it's finding things that are even closer to what you're after.

2726
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And you find something that's a little bit better and you imprint that one.

2727
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And you just like keep upgrading the imprint a little bit to just keep getting better and better and better and better and better,

2728
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
better, better stuff in that same category that is really similar to it.

2729
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
And then you're like, okay, I've got what I'm looking for.

2730
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
This is like the one that I really wanted.

2731
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And you can put something else new in there, maybe.

2732
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Or you just get really lucky from a drop somewhere else and you can slap something new in there.

2733
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,000
All right.

2734
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Uh, can open every note on Weaver Tree or will there be limited points to spend?

2735
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
There are limited points to spend.

2736
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
You cannot get every single note.

2737
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Uh, what means completed 29 of 50?

2738
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Can we get 50 points to spend?

2739
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I believe so.

2740
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Maybe.

2741
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Maybe.

2742
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Um.

2743
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Let's get this in a spot that I can zoom in.

2744
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Look at what you're looking at.

2745
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Uh, yes, yes, yes, that's what that is.

2746
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
All right.

2747
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Any plans for being able to pre-download the patch for season two?

2748
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
No.

2749
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Um, Aaron, you know that.

2750
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Uh, like this.

2751
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Did you guys consider making the woven tree look like a spider's web?

2752
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Yes.

2753
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Um.

2754
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
It kind of restricted the layout, I think, a little bit too much.

2755
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
It made it a little messy behind it.

2756
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Uh, can you save one version of the Weaver's Tree and change it later for having two plus versions?

2757
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
No.

2758
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
You want to respec it, you can respec it.

2759
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Cost Memory Amber to respec.

2760
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Uh, around which level or game progression are we expected to interact with Woven Echoes?

2761
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Is that as soon as you start finishing, start the first model of timeline or a different point?

2762
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
You'll find, um,

2763
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
You'll, you'll, you'll find your first tomb.

2764
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Tomb of, you'll find your very first tomb of the race in Fall of the Outcasts.

2765
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
At level 58 or earlier.

2766
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Uh, when you're going through this one, that's when you will find your first tomb.

2767
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Uh, and in that tomb, you will very likely collect your first Woven Echo.

2768
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Um, item that drops.

2769
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Um, and so you'll be able to interact with Woven Echoes in your very first normal

2770
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Paul the Outcast monolith.

2771
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Um, I'd suggest that you'll likely, and I'm realizing that I was doing that with the

2772
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
tree up, but I apologize.

2773
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Uh, this is what I was showing.

2774
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
You'll find that in your very first, um,

2775
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
say that again.

2776
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
You'll find your very first tomb in Fall of the Outcasts.

2777
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
On normal at level 58 or earlier.

2778
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Uh, and so this is like, this is the, what you'll find it.

2779
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,000
It'll be one of these.

2780
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
It'll just like randomly be, be one of these in your web.

2781
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
It'll just like populate.

2782
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Boom.

2783
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
There it is.

2784
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,000
And given how far I've explored this tree right here, I think you're likely to find

2785
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,000
a tomb with this many nodes exposed.

2786
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
One of like in, in, in season two, like this is how far you'll have to go to find one.

2787
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Likely.

2788
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I think maybe a little bit farther, maybe, maybe one or two more, but not much.

2789
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Like it's, it'll happen pretty quick.

2790
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
All right.

2791
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Um.

2792
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Yeah.

2793
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
So you'll be, I guess the point is you'll be, you'll be integrating into the new systems

2794
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
very early in end game.

2795
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:10,000
All right.

2796
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Is still target farming a good and a thing?

2797
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Is, is still target farming.

2798
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I'm going to go with yes.

2799
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
All right.

2800
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,000
If I choose to focus on arena in monos, will I still have tombs and cemeteries pop up?

2801
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Are they their own echo?

2802
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Um, tombs and cemeteries are still their own echoes.

2803
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Um, so you'll, you'll need to like go into tombs and cemeteries as an echo.

2804
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Are there any plans to remove sounds from items that do not show up in the loot filter?

2805
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Uh, I don't think in season two.

2806
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Uh, why you guys are streaming Q and A during PoE two league launch.

2807
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
You know, this is our usual, our usual time slot.

2808
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
And if I'm, if I'm going to be honest, the reason why I'm streaming today is because I

2809
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
wanted to show this off.

2810
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I was kind of on the fence and, uh, this arrived and I'm like, I'm not going to be on

2811
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
talking to tries podcast on the eighth.

2812
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Uh, and I really wanted to show it off.

2813
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
So that's why I'm here is to show this off.

2814
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
This is a wonderful sign.

2815
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Uh, this incredible sign that was sent in.

2816
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Um, and I, I still can't believe it's huge.

2817
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
It is so solid.

2818
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Uh, it's all like carved out of wood and the, like, there's a light in there.

2819
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
That's right.

2820
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,000
It's like go like if you haven't watched it yet on our, um, uh, our, our, our

2821
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
channel monthly posts, we've got links to the YouTube channel for, uh, the, like the

2822
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
making of for this and it's unbelievably incredible.

2823
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I just can't, it's, it's just, wow.

2824
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
That's why, that's why I'm here today.

2825
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Uh, I have to leave earlier.

2826
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
So you may have talked about this.

2827
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Uh, I had to leave earlier.

2828
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
What is your thoughts on arrangement?

2829
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,000
The options I did, uh, or mainly options like whips, yo-yos, chain sites, and those kinds

2830
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,000
of things became very, very close to putting, uh, something like that in kind of like, um,

2831
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
uh, like the, the Kratos chain swords, things like that.

2832
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Like we, we, we came very close to putting something like that in.

2833
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Um, there was a game kingdoms of Amalur reckoning, uh, that had a super fun, uh, weapon type that

2834
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I really want to recreate at some point.

2835
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:24,000
That's like, um, that that's like weapons spinning, flailing around so much cool stuff

2836
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:24,000
with that.

2837
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Like the, that was the most fun I had playing that game was, was whipping around with

2838
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
those, um, was it chakrams?

2839
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Maybe it was chakrams I'm thinking of in that.

2840
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
It was a ton of fun.

2841
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I really liked it.

2842
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Oh, we are, we are stopping taking questions pretty soon here.

2843
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Um, we're gonna, we're gonna stop taking questions in five minutes.

2844
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
So if you've got a question you want to get in, um, you got five minutes to get that

2845
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
question posted and I'm gonna stop taking questions.

2846
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Um,

2847
01:37:59,000 --> 01:37:59,000
All right.

2848
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Will we see our cosmetics in the character selection screen?

2849
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Yes.

2850
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Are you planning to add the cold conversion cosmetic for someone wolf skill?

2851
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
You already have it for here up boss fight summons.

2852
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Maybe I would say it's, uh, for as a cosmetic, I would say much more likely than as a mechanical thing.

2853
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Uh, at least I can actually play a little bit, can't I?

2854
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I'll just sit around talking, yapping.

2855
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
We're in the arena.

2856
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I can just stand still and just attack stuff.

2857
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Love it.

2858
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
All right.

2859
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Will you delay the release of Uber Abaroth until the first season killed Abaroth like season one?

2860
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:39,000
No, because there's, um, there's less of a mechanical learn the fight requirement for this.

2861
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
So like, if you want to learn, if you want to practice Uber Abaroth, you can go do it right now.

2862
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Practicing Abaroth will be, um, not one-to-one perfectly.

2863
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
There are mechanical differences, but, uh, the vast majority of what you want to know,

2864
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,000
what you want to learn and what you want to practice will be available for, um, uh,

2865
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
to try right now, um, on, on Abaroth.

2866
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Like it's, it's one of the main reasons we did that was so you couldn't practice the fight

2867
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
on an existing OP character.

2868
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Um, but because it's, it's so similar now anyways, it's, it's kind of less of a,

2869
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
a need for that.

2870
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
All right.

2871
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
With the addition of Wazzy, any chance we can get a sixth skill now that the left mouse will be available?

2872
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,000
No.

2873
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Uh, will the last Shaman skill be coming in season two or season three?

2874
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And will it be Fire Totem?

2875
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
No information available at all.

2876
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I'm sorry.

2877
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Uh, will we ever get, oh, here's the, uh, the only answer I can say is it will not be coming in season two.

2878
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Um, we have announced all the new skills coming in season two, uh, and it is not one of them.

2879
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Uh, will we ever get zombie pets similar like skeletons, but zombies with swords and bows?

2880
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Um, I'd say unlikely, but maybe.

2881
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I think the theming overlap is not great.

2882
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Um, and we do already have a zombie skill that, um,

2883
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
doesn't really fit mechanically or thematically with it.

2884
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Uh, what are you going to season start on?

2885
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
I'm going to play Heart Seeker to start with because I've worked on it a bunch and I love it.

2886
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
And Ryxan's my favorite and it's great.

2887
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
All right.

2888
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Even though season two hasn't released yet, are you planning to do seasons more frequently?

2889
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Yes.

2890
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I'm so excited.

2891
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Yes.

2892
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Pick up your set items.

2893
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Um,

2894
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I was playing the game and I stumbled upon a void squirrel.

2895
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Any chance we might be allowed to actually have void squirrels?

2896
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Um, maybe at some point, possibly.

2897
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Uh, it doesn't fit the theming currently that very well.

2898
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
So, I mean, maybe.

2899
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Uh, will the pickup range increase for items for new season?

2900
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Yes, we actually just, that was asking for one of the things we did in the last little bit before the,

2901
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
the, the delay.

2902
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
That's something we did actually.

2903
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
We increased pickup radius for everything.

2904
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I think, uh, gold, maybe not potions.

2905
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I don't know if we increase the potion pickup radius.

2906
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I think that'd be the only thing we left where it was.

2907
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Or if we did, we increase it less than the other increases.

2908
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
But yeah, we increased the pickup radius for, for basically everything.

2909
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Uh, there's also now an option in the settings where you can say, don't auto pick up potions.

2910
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
If you're, uh, or don't like auto heal with potions.

2911
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:54,000
If you are below your, if you're at, sorry, if you're at max potions, um, and are injured.

2912
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
So you're at max potions and not max health.

2913
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Don't pick up a potion and auto use it.

2914
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Because right now, if you're, uh, if you're hurt and you're at max potions and you walk

2915
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
over a potion, it'll just like auto use it like a, like a health orb from D3.

2916
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And, um, you can turn that off because that was messing up a lot of low life builds.

2917
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,000
So that's in the settings.

2918
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
We've, we spoiled that previously, but.

2919
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I realized that I have one more teaser to share.

2920
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
We're actually going to slap it at the top so that I can see my face still.

2921
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:45,000
A little, little sneak peek at, uh, some footprint cosmetic effects that are coming in to season

2922
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:45,000
two.

2923
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
So new style effects.

2924
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I don't know if we've used footprints before.

2925
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Have we?

2926
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
All right.

2927
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
What do you think about certain affixes being near mandatory on certain slots?

2928
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Like for example, movement speed on boots.

2929
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Yeah.

2930
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
This is a tricky one.

2931
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
And we put movement speed as an implicit on boots already specifically because of this.

2932
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Um, oh, we are cutting off questions here.

2933
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
No more questions.

2934
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Cause I still have a couple of pages of questions.

2935
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I have three pages of questions to get through.

2936
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
So I'm going to try and get those, uh, all answered here.

2937
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Thank you very much for the rating party.

2938
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Welcome everyone from that stream.

2939
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Hope you're having a good time.

2940
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Hope you're having fun.

2941
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Um, where are we here?

2942
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
More questions.

2943
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I will answer them all.

2944
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Uh, affixes being near mandatory.

2945
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Yeah.

2946
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
It's, it's something that we've debated a few times and movement speed is the quintessential

2947
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
example of this.

2948
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Um, it's just so thematically appropriate on boots.

2949
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Um, and there are builds that don't need it.

2950
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Um, that we've kind of been, that we've been okay with it so far.

2951
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Um, it's on the radar.

2952
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
It's something that gets debated a fair bit.

2953
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Uh, if it becomes any much more mandatory than it is, um, I think it'll be, we'll probably take some

2954
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
steps like dialing the values down a little bit.

2955
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Um, and like probably like dying the values of the affix down and upping the values of the

2956
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
implicit at the same time.

2957
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:26,000
So like the maximum potential stays the same, but the necessity miss, it's a word.

2958
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Now it is of the affix would go down.

2959
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Um, something like that probably.

2960
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Uh, how's Kyle doing yesterday?

2961
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I watched the old lore stream.

2962
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Consoling great.

2963
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I would love to get Kyle on for the lore stream.

2964
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Um, definitely before the next season comes out for season three, well, I, I will be pushing

2965
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
hard for that.

2966
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Uh, all right.

2967
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Is there a chance that last epoch will release on consoles?

2968
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Oh yeah, there's a chance.

2969
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
It was a good chance.

2970
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Eventually.

2971
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Um, I don't have any specifics, which consoles, ETAs, any of those sorts of things,

2972
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
but it is something that we are interested in doing.

2973
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Um, and there's lots of stuff we are doing now to prepare for that in the future.

2974
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Uh, yeah.

2975
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Uh, whose idea was the Joth bear?

2976
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Brilliant.

2977
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Yes.

2978
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Uh, that was, I think that was Holly.

2979
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Um, so if you saw, you saw Holly, uh, was on the, um, the first of our tour of the race

2980
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:21,000
podcast, uh, I think that was her, uh, her idea to do.

2981
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Um, yeah, it's, if anyone doesn't know.

2982
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:31,000
There are bears in last epoch that, um, can teleport and they're, they're called a

2983
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Joth bear and a Joth bear is a reference to the Diablo two rune word Joth or Joth bear,

2984
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
depending on how you pronounce it.

2985
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Um, which is, gives you the ability to teleport makes the enigma room word,

2986
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
which I know almost everyone here is like, of course, Mike, we know that.

2987
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Why are you explaining it to us?

2988
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Yes.

2989
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
All right.

2990
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
How many coworkers mysteriously became sick today?

2991
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
You should definitely not go play the game that just launched.

2992
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Uh, I don't know.

2993
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I mean, very few, if any.

2994
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Oh, the heroes, here's a little bit more details on.

2995
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Uh, on this that I'll tell you right now.

2996
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Um, so we were talking about the, the number at the bottom of the screen here, this number down here.

2997
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Um, yeah, this is the, uh, how many of these points you've unlocked.

2998
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Uh, 13 of them come from ranks in the Weaver's faction and 37 of them come from,

2999
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
as rewards from completing specific woven echoes.

3000
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Just like, leave that up.

3001
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Uh, I feel like if I do all of the videos at once, the audio is going to be terrible.

3002
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Uh,

3003
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Uh,

3004
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,000
there we go.

3005
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
All the teasers.

3006
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:40,000
All right.

3007
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:46,000
How much does COF ranks interact with new Weaver tree stuff?

3008
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
For example, in the, is the Weaver know where it drops a pile of similar loot.

3009
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:52,000
The imprint item is affected by COF ranks at 25% chance to upgrade rare.

3010
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Is all that, yeah, they affect just like any other normal drops do.

3011
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Uh, thank you for the sub.

3012
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Oh, that's one that's got it.

3013
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
That's got capitalizations.

3014
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
It doesn't, uh, Robin Nakalaki.

3015
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Robin Nalaki.

3016
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Robin Nalak Lee.

3017
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,000
You got close.

3018
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
You got close.

3019
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I appreciate the sub that is always appreciated.

3020
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
All right.

3021
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Uh, when the team talks about new classes, can you mention one or two that are no longer being considered?

3022
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:28,000
No.

3023
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Sorry.

3024
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I don't, I don't think anything's been like fully ruled out.

3025
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
That's like been suggested.

3026
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Uh, in coming season two, will the COF MG harbinger faction ranks benefit be changed or improved?

3027
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Uh, there are some light adjustments to some of those.

3028
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Minimal though.

3029
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Are we still going to be forced into doing the campaign or can do arena at level one for alternate leveling?

3030
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Um, you, if, if you aren't playing multiplayer and, uh, you don't have anyone that you can teleport to,

3031
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
to, to jump and skip stuff that way.

3032
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Uh, the default flow for a single player experience is through the campaign, uh, exclusively still.

3033
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Uh, will there be more than five skills in each mastery?

3034
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Quite possibly.

3035
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Yes.

3036
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
That is not set in stone at all.

3037
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Uh, will we get, like, we very intentionally left space for more skills in each one of the masteries.

3038
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Uh, will we get dwarf slash blacksmith faction in the future for better crafting mechanics?

3039
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
That's possible.

3040
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
That's, that's, I would say a solid option that we haven't really delved too deeply into yet.

3041
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Uh, that didn't cause any problems.

3042
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I think we're good still.

3043
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Um, hey, love the game.

3044
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Thank you.

3045
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Appreciate that.

3046
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
10 minutes left.

3047
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I got to rattle through these, but there's one thing that's always bothered me a little bit.

3048
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Oh no.

3049
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Uh, it's to do with walking animation.

3050
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
It feels a bit floaty to me.

3051
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Am I alone in that?

3052
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Keep it up.

3053
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Um, yeah, there was, um, there's, especially if you're like, you can't see what I'm doing right

3054
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
now, but especially if you like click really close to your character, it definitely starts

3055
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
to feel a little floaty.

3056
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Um, there's some animation adjustments and some acceleration adjustments that we've talked

3057
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
about doing for improving the, the, the walking animation stuff that's happened.

3058
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I don't know if, uh, specifically what ended up happening there, but it's not,

3059
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
uh, I've seen feedback similar to this in the past.

3060
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
So that I guess, uh, I don't know if it's already answered already.

3061
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:30,000
It's okay.

3062
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Do you plan on changing how the ward bar works during the boss phases?

3063
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Um, the, the functional, the mechanics of it are, we're very pleased with the actual mechanics

3064
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
of it and that is sticking around.

3065
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Um, there are very, very few bosses that have the word bar now, especially compared to what

3066
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
it was in season one.

3067
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Um, so season two, we're removing the word bar from most sources that had it.

3068
01:50:52,000 --> 01:51:00,000
So, uh, the only times you'll see it now are in, um, like, uh, timeline bosses, uh, very specific,

3069
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
uh, like pinnacle bosses, things like that.

3070
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Like, like we're talking end game bosses, um, or like big chapter bosses, like when it's a

3071
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,000
really important fight, that's, that's when we'll have those up to just, because we really,

3072
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
we really want it to be easier for, uh, for homebrew builds.

3073
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
We want homebrew builds to be functional and actually have a place in the game.

3074
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Uh, and it's, it's really to support those builds.

3075
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Like this, this is a system that makes those builds much more functional and popular and

3076
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
possible in the game to work.

3077
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
And so you're not having to follow a meta build quite as much.

3078
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I know it might not feel that way.

3079
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Um, but I promise you, that's what it's doing.

3080
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Uh, will we get those fancy armor from the solar units, uh, for the Paladin?

3081
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Possibly.

3082
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I can see that being cool MTX to have.

3083
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
We, we were reluctant to give cosmetic effects to the player that are the same as enemies.

3084
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Um, we'd want to tweak them usually just so that you don't blend in too much.

3085
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Uh, will there be any resonance, uh, changes on resonance drop rates?

3086
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
My friend is too stubborn to craft his, her own gear.

3087
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Uh, yeah, we, we are adjusting some of those a little bit.

3088
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Uh, right.

3089
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Uh, only 40 minutes behind.

3090
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
What is, what's a procedural content procedural content?

3091
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Um, random map generation.

3092
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:19,000
So we'll say like, um, here's, here's, here's the, the short version of the most straightforward,

3093
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
uh, simple version of what procedural content generation means.

3094
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Is this is behind everything?

3095
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Oh my goodness.

3096
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:26,000
That's not gonna work.

3097
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Um,

3098
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:34,000
if you have, you, you end up with like, you create, uh,

3099
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:40,000
uh, so you're creating a, uh, a system of corridors and hallways in a, in a big castle.

3100
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And you say like, here's a straight through path.

3101
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Here's a T intersection.

3102
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Here's a cross intersection.

3103
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Here's a left turn.

3104
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Here's a right turn.

3105
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
And, uh, you like, you print them all out onto pieces of paper and tiles and you shuffle those

3106
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
tiles around and you start slapping them down like a board game that builds itself as you play.

3107
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Like, uh, if you ever played like a betrayal at house on the hill or like zombies or a bajillion

3108
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:06,000
other procedural generated board games where you like place tiles down as you're, as you're playing

3109
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
the game, you come to like a door and it like, you pick a new tile off the top of the deck and

3110
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
you put the tile down and it like makes the room.

3111
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
And, um, so that's like the, the baseline for procedural content generation.

3112
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Um, where it's like, it's random in a set of rules where it like makes content on the fly.

3113
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Uh, so it's not the same.

3114
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
So you don't memorize it.

3115
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:25,000
That sort of thing.

3116
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Um, and the place we're leveraging that is in, um, our tombs and cemeteries to start with.

3117
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
And we're going to expand that out to other parts of the game.

3118
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Once we are confident and happy that that is working and people are happy playing with it.

3119
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
All right.

3120
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Hi, uh, how, and so far the feedback has been really positive.

3121
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
So I'm, we've already started working on putting it into new places.

3122
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Um, how did the unity engine upgrade go?

3123
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Great.

3124
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Does it change anything for you as a dev?

3125
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
It changes a few little things.

3126
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Um, there's like new features in the backend stuff that we can do, uh, makes things a little

3127
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:57,000
bit smoother.

3128
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
That sort of stuff.

3129
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
You've actually, if you, if you're playing live right now, you're playing on the updated version.

3130
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
All right.

3131
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
What is the feature you're most excited for players to experience the new patch?

3132
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Probably the, uh, the, um, probably, I think probably just interacting with the woven echoes

3133
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
and the weaver tree, all that new, the whole new end game system is so huge.

3134
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Um, some of the new boss fights are pretty cool though, too.

3135
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Yeah.

3136
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
All right.

3137
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:36,000
1500 hours.

3138
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Since playing beta, since beta, that's pretty sweet.

3139
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Uh, there's a step, there's a steep difficulty from mono level 90, uh, compared to empowered

3140
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
model level 100.

3141
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I usually will reach first empowered at level 80.

3142
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Why not corruption?

3143
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Zero to a hundred on normal monos.

3144
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Yeah.

3145
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
This is something we've talked about.

3146
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:02,000
It's, I think it's really good to have some, some difficulty jumps, like a few thresholds.

3147
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
The jump there is too big right now.

3148
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,000
And, uh, we are leveraging things in the woven echoes to, to help with that.

3149
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Um, yeah, I, I agree that there's, that there's some, that that jumps too big and we are shrinking it a little bit.

3150
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Um, but we don't want to, we don't want to cut it off completely.

3151
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Cause it's good that there's some jumps, but maybe you make them hops, not jumps, you know?

3152
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:32,000
All right.

3153
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Does the tombs give stability?

3154
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Yes.

3155
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
The tombs are normal echoes as well.

3156
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Uh, have you guys considered doing a display collab or something similar?

3157
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Yeah.

3158
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I, I, I've thought about that.

3159
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I think it'd be sweet.

3160
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Uh, since you don't have your own merch store yet, I would love to do display collab.

3161
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:46,000
That'd be sweet.

3162
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Um, I've considered getting it a few times.

3163
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Um,

3164
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I, I, uh, I play a lot of magic and play a lot of magic.

3165
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I would like to play a lot of magic.

3166
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Um, and so yeah, I, a lot of, uh, magic creators, content creators, um, like streamers and YouTubers,

3167
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:13,000
they, uh, um, they, they get displayed sponsorships a lot.

3168
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
So I see them a lot.

3169
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I'm like, I've come very close to getting displayed stuff quite a few times, but this is so much better,

3170
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
which you can't really see completely.

3171
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Cause I've blocked it.

3172
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
What blasphemy is this?

3173
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Cause this is so much better.

3174
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Uh, all right.

3175
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Here's where I'm learning.

3176
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
My monitor is not level.

3177
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Uh, the webcam is resting on the monitor.

3178
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:49,000
All right.

3179
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Uh, will we ever get something like divination cards and Pwee?

3180
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Possibly.

3181
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Um, probably want to put our own twist on it more so, but, um, I do really like the system.

3182
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
It's that, it's that incremental buildup towards like, I found a piece of something amazing.

3183
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I found a piece of something amazing.

3184
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
And that, uh, that style of system is really strong.

3185
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
This is kind of a similar thing to what we were talking about with rune words earlier.

3186
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,000
When you found a piece of something you find, you find a jaw rune and you're like, okay,

3187
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
I've found one third of a, of an enigma.

3188
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Um, assuming the, not kidding.

3189
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
The if is the third, I'm counting the, the armor base plate, the perfect base is the third of it.

3190
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Um, and I think that's a really powerful, um, feeling.

3191
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
So I, I'd love to add something like that.

3192
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
We don't have something specific plan though.

3193
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Uh, do you guys ever plan to add mounts with larger maps?

3194
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Um, probably we don't have any specific plans for it right now.

3195
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Uh, there are some really cool stuff that happens with it, but it is, as you mentioned in the question as

3196
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
well, the maps we've all made are really not designed to have mounts in them.

3197
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
So no plans at the moment.

3198
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Uh, I really like the player's threshold defense system that gives damage resist at 35%.

3199
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
How did that come about?

3200
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Um, that was actually, that's, that's funny.

3201
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
We were trying to find ways to, this is really early.

3202
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
This is like, um, this is in alpha.

3203
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
So pre, pre beta.

3204
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
So we're not even like online yet.

3205
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I don't think.

3206
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:20,000
And we were trying to find ways to have people almost die, like come really close to dying

3207
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,000
and just like, just, just hold on with like a sliver of health left.

3208
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Um, and so we built this endurance system into the health bar and didn't tell anyone it was,

3209
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
it was a completely hidden system.

3210
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
There was no way to interact with it.

3211
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,000
The game didn't tell you it was happening, but it would like protect the last, I think it was 10%

3212
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:40,000
of that time, maybe 20% of your health significantly more than it would protect the rest of your health.

3213
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
It's just naturally just to be like, oh, you held on by it.

3214
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Just, just the thread.

3215
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Um, and it was, it was cool.

3216
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:52,000
And it was, it was, it was there and people were like asking for it and we're like, it's already

3217
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:52,000
there.

3218
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Like we just didn't tell you about it, but it is there.

3219
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Um, and so we decided to like integrate it into a proper system and we were, because we were looking

3220
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
for new defensive mechanics to integrate into the game and ways to scale your defenses that would

3221
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,000
synergize well with health builds and not be ward centric as much.

3222
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Um, and so it got, that's, it got converted from a secret system to a real system then.

3223
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Uh, and that was early online days and those in beta phase.

3224
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I think that's when that happened.

3225
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I could be wrong.

3226
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Endurance is the system we're talking about, by the way.

3227
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Speaking of weapons in, uh, to intro in L E.

3228
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Oh my gosh.

3229
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Oh my gosh.

3230
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Uh, I'm not going to pronounce that properly.

3231
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Kusari Yagama.

3232
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I apologize that I butchered that horribly to whatever region of the world that I butchered

3233
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
that from, uh,

3234
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
a chain and ball scythe is what I'm being told.

3235
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
That sounds cool.

3236
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
That sounds really cool.

3237
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Um, I don't, I don't think, I don't think my body's ready for that.

3238
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Something that cool.

3239
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Uh, I think it would have to come with a, like a martial arts themed character or

3240
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
something like that probably, which I would love to do.

3241
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:11,000
All right.

3242
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Did you guys thought about adding a premium supported package where a player can submit

3243
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
a unique idea you guys develop and put their name on it?

3244
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Yes, we've done that.

3245
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
I would pay to have my name in an item inside the game.

3246
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Yeah, we've, we've, we, we used to offer this.

3247
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Um, we're still working through some of the old ones.

3248
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Um, but yes, we have done this before.

3249
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
We've done it as rewards for things.

3250
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:40,000
We've done it as, um, yeah, the, the problem we had with this was it was too popular and

3251
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
too many of them got purchased.

3252
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Uh, they were a thousand dollars and we had too many of them, uh, get purchased very quickly.

3253
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,000
We're like gotten to, it's like a huge backlog of them.

3254
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Um, and like, it feels in order to like do that fairly, we'd have to, I think we'd have

3255
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
to, if we were going to bring it back, I, I don't know if we can bring it back or how

3256
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
we bring it back, but I think we would have to put some sort of limit on the number that

3257
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:05,000
we did.

3258
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Um, and I don't, and we'd have to figure out, find some fair way to do it like a lottery

3259
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:10,000
system.

3260
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Cause I don't think that having, I don't love the idea of being like, all right, well in

3261
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
order to like get it down to the limit of the number that we want to do with these,

3262
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
we'll just start increasing the price.

3263
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
And it's like, it's $5,000, it's $10,000.

3264
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
And that feels weird selling something like that for that much money.

3265
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Like there just seems like too much money, but it's like at 1000, which already seemed

3266
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
insane was too low because people were buying too many of them.

3267
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Um, so we, I think we'd have to put some sort of, but just like a first come first serve

3268
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
feels bad too.

3269
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Cause people are just like at work that day or, you know, just the internet's not working as fast

3270
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:43,000
as something.

3271
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,000
So like, I feel like there'd need to be some sort of lottery system, um, or tie it to a

3272
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
reward system or something.

3273
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I don't know how exactly we do it, but, um, I'd love to bring it back.

3274
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:52,000
I do.

3275
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I love doing supporter uniques.

3276
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:58,000
There's a really cool supporter unique, um, coming for, uh, there's a witch fire unique.

3277
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,000
That's a support unique coming in season two that you should keep an eye out for it.

3278
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Cause I think it's really awesome.

3279
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Not just cause I worked on it.

3280
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Um, but that was, uh, I won't say their name, but yes, shout out to the person who suggested that

3281
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
because I, well, I didn't, it wasn't even on my radar as a style

3282
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
of thing we could do.

3283
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Um, and I'm so happy they suggested it.

3284
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Okay.

3285
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Uh, any interest on incentivizing multiplayer co-op?

3286
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Yes.

3287
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Gigantic asterisk there.

3288
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Um, I think the way we incentivize multiplayer co-op is just making it more fun.

3289
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I think, I think, um, like putting things to do in the game that are interesting and cool,

3290
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
but, uh, we really want to avoid having mandatory content for multiplayer.

3291
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,000
So a boss where it's like, Hey, if you want to fight this, you gotta get, you gotta find

3292
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
10 friends to fight this boss or something like that.

3293
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
It's not something we're super interested in doing right now.

3294
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Um, but we are getting to the point where they're getting enough content that it doesn't feel like

3295
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:59,000
you're missing out on a huge section of the game by not interacting with it.

3296
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,000
So maybe it's, it's more in the cards now than it was a year ago for sure.

3297
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Um, but it's not something that we're actively working on right now.

3298
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
When comes the new season?

3299
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
It's right around the corner.

3300
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
It's on the 17th.

3301
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Huge hype for that in my world.

3302
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Anyways, um, my little bubble, anything that you can say about the cocoon items.

3303
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Come on, Mike, drop something huge here.

3304
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I don't want to wait till talking to try podcast.

3305
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

3306
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
You're going to have to wait till talking to try podcast.

3307
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
We're going, we're doing deep dive on items.

3308
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Um, four days from now on the eight.

3309
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Uh, we're going to have any, any items questions that you guys have, which there were lots of items

3310
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:46,000
questions, um, today, which were, there was good item questions, but yes, that, that is the day

3311
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
that we're going to be releasing items.

3312
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
There's, um,

3313
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
so, uh, essentially try tries not in the CT program.

3314
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Um, so there's, he didn't have, he doesn't have like an, uh, um, like an insider knowledge

3315
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
of like questions to like steer with.

3316
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Uh, and there's a few things that we're, um, and I think, I think that's a good thing that,

3317
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,000
that there's, uh, people that we're doing interviews with that weren't in the CT program.

3318
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Um, so we're, we're, we're going to be, uh, there's a few things that are being unveiled

3319
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
there that I'm really excited about.

3320
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
So check, check that out.

3321
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Um, I don't know the time.

3322
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I think it's 3 PM.

3323
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I think it's the same time as the stream normally is.

3324
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Yeah.

3325
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
There's gonna be tons of awesome stuff there.

3326
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
We were prepping for that a little bit today.

3327
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:39,000
All right.

3328
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
That's going to do it for me.

3329
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
We're all done.

3330
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I hope you had fun.

3331
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I know I did.

3332
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I will be back, uh, actually same time, same place next week, except different place,

3333
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
same time, different place.

3334
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Cause on the 11th.

3335
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:59,000
So next Friday we are doing, uh, our final podcast tour with, uh, Aaron action RPG and

3336

3337
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Um, and that's going to be, uh, three more of us from each G on that one.

3338
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Uh, can't remember exactly who else is going to be there.

3339
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I, Oh, I'm pretty sure it's going to be Judd carving me.

3340
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Um, but I could be wrong.

3341
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
We'll see.

3342
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
See who it is.

3343
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Uh, yeah.

3344
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Thanks for stopping by everyone.

3345
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Oh, I love doing these streams.

3346
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Oh yeah.

3347
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Okay.

3348
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Find someone to say hi to.

3349
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Who's doing cool stuff.

3350
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Oh, we were, we were just, we were just talking about him.

Let's go.

3352
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Let's go say hi.

3353
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Oh, is Perry's podcast starting right now?

Okay.
