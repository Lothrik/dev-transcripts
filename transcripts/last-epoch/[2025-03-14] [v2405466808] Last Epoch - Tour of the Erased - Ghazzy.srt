00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, this is Mike. I'm talking in my microphone.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Too loud, too low.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good chat has to say.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sounds good.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Wonders.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Carve, you're up.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
One, two, three.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here we are.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Too loud, too silent.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And it's in chat.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Totally good.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Good, good, good, good, good.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
All right, everybody says good.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A bit quiet. Wait, who's quiet?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Twitch chat's saying good, though.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Carve will be quiet. I'll raise him up then.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And suddenly I'll move closer to my mic and I'm going to be super loud.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's going to be great.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It is what it is.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Part of the job, right?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I think we got everything.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You guys just want to jump straight into it?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
All right.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's make a little quick intro then.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hi, everybody.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Welcome to my interview with Last Deep Work Devs.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mike in Carve.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's been a while since I saw you at Carve.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's what?

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
X-LocCon, I think?

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's good to see you again.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And Mike, we've had a couple of interviews in the past already.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Welcome aboard, everybody.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How are you doing, Mike?

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Doing great.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Feeling good.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's, I always love doing these.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So excited to see what we get some spicy questions in here.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We've got some good stuff to share.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
For sure.

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
For sure.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And Carve, how are you doing?

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, I'm good.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Pretty excited.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We got some good stuff to talk about.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Photon sent me some images here in the Discord here that we're going to be showing.

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Quite excited to show these, actually.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And there's probably more images to be coming later that we just didn't want to dump immediately here.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's fair.

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's fair.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All right.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, we have about one or two hours to basically put you guys in the furnace.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So I'm just going to go straight into this.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And you guys have been spammed.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I've been spammed.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Everyone's talking about it.

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was going to get rid of the elephant in the room.

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And that is obviously the scheduling.

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Two days after you guys are launching.

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
PeeWee 2 is coming out.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's the take here?

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Like, what's the...

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How do I read this room?

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Because everyone's kind of upset about it.

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, we're disappointed along with everyone else on this.

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And we're just focusing on our Season 2 right now.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And, you know, just building the hype and excitement for what we've got coming out.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's our big focus right now.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That sounds good.

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We've got good stuff coming in.

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So it's worth it to get excited for.

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah.

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Always disappointed.

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But, yeah.

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Of course.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Of course.

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I mean, I've been trying my best not to spill the beans on the CT stuff.

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But the stuff I've seen is very exciting.

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you.

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, let's go into...

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's hard not to say anything, though, isn't it?

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I know.

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm just sitting here with a grin on my face.

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
People asking questions.

91
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What about this?

92
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What about that?

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And I'm like, I know exactly the answer to that.

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, we haven't gotten access to everything, which I think is good.

95
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And I've been trying not to explore too much of the in-depth stuff.

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So on launch, a lot of things will still be kind of fresh for me, which is going to be very fun.

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So this interview, we're going to be focusing on basically class rework and balance.

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So those are the main overlaying themes of this interview.

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So that's the questions we're going to be following up for the rest of this interview.

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's going to be with that theme.

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I'm going to start off with number one in my little list here, which is about meta shakeups and how you guys are intending to tackling balance in general, both in terms of timelines, such as, you know, only having changes on every launch or mid-seasonal changes, and also asking if the idea is to earn nerf outliers at the top or rather exclusively bringing underperforming builds up on par.

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, it's...

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, yeah, it's a combination approach of basically everything you've got there.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So we really want to take those builds that are crazy outliers, because there's a few of them that are a little wacky, what they can do, and bringing those down into the realms of reality.

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And...

106
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But we are raising the floor on a lot of builds right now.

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So there's a lot of new stuff coming in that's going to make a lot of builds that were not working, not having a great time.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You get to endgame, you're trying to push through some of the more difficult content.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So bringing the floor up on a lot of builds is really important at the same time.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Getting everything into that, like, 80%, 80-100% range is, I think...

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think...

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's the goal in general, yeah.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And we're not really interested in the mid-season changes yet, so we are still focusing on that, getting things near the start of the season as much as possible.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, when we asked the community, I don't even remember when it was about mid-season changes.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
They were pretty against it, for a good reason.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's like, imagine playing something really fun and then it just gets nuked out of orbit because it was just too good.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So we generally try to avoid that as much as possible.

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And then only, like, do it like buggy interactions and whatnot.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, yeah.

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's true.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But what comes to the nerfing, like, over-performers versus just buffing everything else...

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This patch, the floor is going to come up because we have new stuff that's going to give you new power.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So obviously the maximum of power you can get is going to go up.

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And then the gearing, like the plateau of how quickly you start having issues upgrading your gear is going to last longer because there's going to be so much new stuff to help you craft.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And obviously, let's say...

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is random numbers.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's say you have a thousand builds.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And out of those thousand builds, there's like ten that are just like a thousand times better than everything else.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's a lot easier to target nerf those down while buffing the rest a bit versus trying to bring everything up because that would also buff the over-performers.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Because when the games get as complicated as we have, if you buff something, it's most likely going to affect something else too.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Because we have stuff like triggering other abilities and if you buff an item that is used in like ten builds, then every build is going to get a buff and so on.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's fair.

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I remember former class lead designer Adam Jackson for Diablo 4, he used a hand gesture and basically said they want to have builds within this frame.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And they want to bring builds above this line down to this frame and builds beneath it up to that frame and have basically everything in existence exist within this parameter of build performance.

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And we have other games like P.O.A., for example, who are perfectly fine with builds basically just being really bad.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And then they want to try to have a kind of a healthy frame in this hand gesture moment here with a couple of outliers every meta shakeups that are performing a bit better.

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What is the approach of that kind of theme moving forward with last deep book?

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you okay with builds being underperforming or do you want all of the builds to exist within this parameter?

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I mean, I think it's a good way of describing it.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And I think in a perfect world, everything would be in that range where like there are certain things that need to be more stronger and there are certain things that need to be weaker.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
In order for like you to make you feel like when you're making good decisions in the game and you are you're like, hey, I figured out a way to make my build stronger.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Something has to be weaker for that to be true.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And so there's never getting everything to the exact same level is is a fool's errand and it's never going to work.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's never going to happen.

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And we don't want to.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But yes, getting everything into a closer range where like the the lower performing ones are still viable is is ideal.

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We know we're never going to have like if someone wants to try and take some build that is I get in trouble when I say this because I say some ridiculous build and someone's like, I'm going to make it work.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like if there's always certain things that are just so ridiculous that you're just not going to make them.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's just not going to happen.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's fair.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
All right.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So we're going to move on to the next question, which is kind of a big one.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And it's about defenses.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And the first one we're going to cover is balance approach comparing health versus ward.

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And we've been existing in this pendulum swinging back and forth.

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We had this huge life meta and then he swung back to ward meta.

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then we was back to to a life meta and then we're back in ward again.

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So what's the approach of available toolkits and balancing the differences between health and ward moving forward from here?

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, we might just end discussing this topic for the rest of the podcast.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So, yeah.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So, yeah, you're right.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ward has been really good and it's been really bad.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And on launch, it was really good.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And then we brought it down a bit.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Not enough.

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So there's going to be more changes to slightly nerf ward where it needs a nerf.

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But we're also buffing health.

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think the first thing would be that int is just a very good stat to stack.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You get all the great stuff, especially for specific classes like acolytes and a mage.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So we are reducing the ward retention you get from 4% to 2%.

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And then we're going to be targeting cases where skills or passives are just very good at generating ward out of nowhere.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I think we gave you a picture of one of the nodes for Acolyte.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The pure fruit?

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I can bring it up.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah, that one.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah.

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So that one specifically, you get ward when you hit a target that is afflicted by spirit plague.

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So that is just whenever you hit something that has it, you get ward.

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
With 3 points, that's like 12 ward per hit.

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And with some cool skill interactions, you can get a lot of hits per second.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Especially because stuff like bone curse is considered a hit.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So you can like double the effect there.

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So what we're doing is we are curtailing the power of like these absolutely insane amount of applications per second.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But we're buffing the individual cases.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So builds that aren't like abusing those million hits a second are going to be better.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And those that we're abusing are going to be worse.

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So we got cases like this in a couple items.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I think just a couple rings that have like ward on a hit and stuff like that.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And then overall, ward is just like way too easy to get from passives and skills.

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So we're moving a lot of that into items.

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So there's a couple new like, I think, affixes for it.

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So it just, it takes more gear now to get that.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So basically the powers moved more from away from the pass and the free access and moved into gear progression to build it up.

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And just to everyone's clear, this one up here is the current version of future recovery.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And the one down here is after the changes on the bottom here.

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, so numbers going up.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's a big buff, right?

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's quite extensive, yes.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Unless you are hitting like 100 times a second.

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Unless, yeah.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then it's enough.

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:23,000
As for health, health was basically all tied to gear in most cases.

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You get a decent amount of passives and whatnot.

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But then we have like these crazy items like, you know, the stout idol that has a double health.

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It has increased health and it has a flat health.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So I think we removed the flat health from there.

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then, because it's now we're nerfing the health belts there.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So what we ended up doing is we're buffing some of the health values and affixes.

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I think we introduced one or two new health affixes, like hybrid affixes.

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
One is region.

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So region is going to be pretty good.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This patch.

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Which previously haven't really been.

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's only like couple built, very specific built that were really good with region.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But now it's going to be more available.

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, like the vessel of strife, right?

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,000
From Jura.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah.

220
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, that item might specifically have been nerfed a tiny bit to compensate.

222
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
God damn it.

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah.

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And then we also increased the health gain per level.

225
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So I think it's currently eight health you get whenever your character levels up.

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
In season two, it's going to be ten.

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So you're just going to get more health just from levels as well.

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And health potions are more effective now too.

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Do you guys think that this is going to be enough to get like a balance between the two?

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So you don't feel like you're scuffed for playing life or the other ward instead?

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Do you feel like they're going to be pretty balanced with this?

233
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Or how's the confidence in this?

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're going to see health builds, especially in classes that are good with it.

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And you'll hopefully also see reward builds for those classes.

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Especially like Mage and Acolyte.

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Because they have a lot of support for that.

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So they should be good with it.

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
As for like the ultimate, like...

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I've seen a lot of talk about we should just cap ward.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
To be like a percentage of your max health or something like that.

242
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I mean, we could do that.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But it's just boring.

244
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's just boring.

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We'd rather try to slowly balance it so they're both really good and cool.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And maybe some hybrids where you do both and stuff like that.

247
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Because it's just fun trying to break the game with stuff like that.

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's just fun.

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Fair enough.

250
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I mean, I like the approach.

251
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Especially like with removing the whole double life idols.

252
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's been...

253
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, it's so frustrating is a good way to put it.

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
At least for COF to try to find these double life idols.

255
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because of how valuable they are for the defensive layers of your character.

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But speaking of defensive layers.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There's another question we have.

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Which is about the crazy differences in performance between different ailments.

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And the question is if this is going to be tackled in the new season.

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
With ailments specifically.

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm not talking about just taking the damage amailments.

262
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But also applying those type of ailments.

263
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So is there something you can cover or leak for us here regarding this for season 2?

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I mean, there's no leak.

265
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There's only teasers and knowledge, I guess.

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You'll be taking less damage from damage over time.

267
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Overall.

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Just globally.

269
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Enemies will deal less damage than you know.

270
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I think it's like 15%.

271
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
15, yeah.

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And then, on top of that.

273
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Corruption.

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You know, the corruption providing more damage to enemies.

275
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That is half as effective for DOTS.

276
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So if they grant 200% more damage.

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
They only get 100% damage for DOTS.

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay.

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So I've been doing some rounds talking to some Last Epoch creators.

280
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That mainly make content for Last Epoch.

281
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And Sagan Survives is a content creator that I was talking to.

282
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That had a question specifically about damage over time that you take.

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Because of how reducing the DOTS damage taken and higher corruptions.

284
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It has become such a mandatory stat.

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So the changes you were talking about.

286
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Lowering the corruption.

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The impact on that specifically.

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Is the solution to that problem.

289
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Am I understanding you correctly then?

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah.

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So we could just introduce more different mechanics.

292
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
For you to reduce DOT damage.

293
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But then that puts more pressure on gear.

294
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Which you already have a lot of pressure on gear for damage mitigation.

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Because we're scaling the damage and health of enemies with corruption.

296
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Like the same time.

297
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So they end up doing more damage before they die from your damage.

298
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So it's very heavily lopsided.

299
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Just investing in the defense in the endgame.

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In Last Epoch currently.

301
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Fair enough.

302
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
As for some of the elements that players do.

303
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So specifically two elements tied to Sentinel.

304
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So Electrify.

305
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Which is like the holy lightning damage over time.

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Is getting a lot more support for Paladin now.

307
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I think you might have a couple pictures of that somewhere.

308
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We do.

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It was just so buried.

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And impossible to get things that scaled with it.

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It had a couple uniques.

312
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

313
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It had a couple uniques.

314
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That were basically.

315
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You had to use them.

316
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We're probably still going to use some of them.

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I think we nerfed some of them a tiny bit.

318
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Because we made the.

319
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's just more accessible to actually scale.

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Electrify.

321
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
As a Paladin now.

322
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So we introduced a new Affix.

323
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Which I think spawns both on helmets and body armors.

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Which is just Electrify chance with lightning skills.

325
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And then.

326
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
On the Paladin passive tree.

327
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
There's some more Electrify support.

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
As well as a new like an actual scaler.

329
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
There's a new node that provides you more lightning damage over time.

330
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Based on your Crit Multi.

331
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So if you have like 300% Crit Multi.

332
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,000
From gear.

333
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So this is.

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The Crit Multi.

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
On top of the base.

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So the base Crit Multi.

337
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Isn't calculate here.

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So if you have like 300% Crit Multi.

339
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's.

340
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I think 150% more.

341
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Lightning damage over time.

342
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So maybe there's some.

343
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Hybrid hit.

344
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Without lightning builds out there.

345
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Who knows.

346
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I think we've got a picture for that one too actually.

347
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah we do.

348
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The.

349
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Judgment of Storm.

350
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yes.

351
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Is the node.

352
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

353
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Here's the Electrify example.

354
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Judgment of Storm.

355
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This is for the Electrify support for Paladins.

356
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

357
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Which has a threshold node.

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
A very important point out.

359
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's a threshold node.

360
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Which you kind of want to see more in Acolyte by the way.

361
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Shock Chance.

362
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Lightning Rest Shred.

363
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And Electrify Chance.

364
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And the threshold is.

365
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You'll deal more lightning damage over time.

366
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Multiplicative with other modifiers.

367
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Per 2%.

368
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Add a Crit Multi.

369
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Above the base 200.

370
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So that's how you bypass the base.

371
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Then save it.

372
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Add a Crit Multi above.

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That is what's adding to it.

374
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yep.

375
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And somebody in the chat asked.

376
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If this affix is only for Sentinels.

377
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And yes.

378
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Sentinel.

379
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Well.

380
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Paladins more specifically.

381
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because it's a.

382
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The ailment is like the Holy themed.

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So that's why it's very heavily tied.

384
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
To just Sentinel and Paladins specifically.

385
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Does that mean that the Electrify modifier.

386
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Would only show up on Sentinel specific items.

387
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yes.

388
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That affix.

389
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The Electrify Chance with lighting skills.

390
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Is only for Sentinels.

391
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Just like.

392
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Just like you have like plus level of skills.

393
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
For individual skills.

394
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
For different classes.

395
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
On like body armor relics and chests.

396
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So then I would assume that.

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If you get the craft charts.

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
For that modifier.

399
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can then put it on non-Sentinel pieces as well.

400
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But you don't.

401
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You will never drop a non-Sentinel piece.

402
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That has that modifier on it.

403
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Like you won't craft it on it.

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No.

405
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No.

406
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It has to always go on Sentinel.

407
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You can't.

408
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You cannot get that mod on any class.

409
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Other than a Sentinel.

410
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Can't even craft it on it.

411
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No.

412
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No.

413
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Same thing.

414
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah.

415
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Same thing for other.

416
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Yep.

417
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Like affix like that.

418
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And then the other.

419
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The other element.

420
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Is something that people know exists.

421
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But it's basically just.

422
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's just a.

423
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The stat that you have for some builds.

424
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And that's Time Rot.

425
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Yeah.

426
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And.

427
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yes.

428
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Time Rot is actually a.

429
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Alement now.

430
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That you can make.

431
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Pretty crazy.

432
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We didn't want to.

433
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We didn't want to just make it like every other element.

434
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Which would be uncapped.

435
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Which caused a lot of.

436
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The problems with balance.

437
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And just tech issues.

438
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
We're not going to probably go into too much with that.

439
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But.

440
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That meant we had to have.

441
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Like unique scalers for it basically.

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Because like.

443
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Uncapped elements.

444
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You like.

445
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You get like pen.

446
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You get damage.

447
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You get duration.

448
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like how many you can apply.

449
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
As soon as possible.

450
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So since Time Rot is still capped at 12.

451
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We need to find.

452
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Basically more multipliers for it.

453
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That.

454
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Allow you to scale the damage of it.

455
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So.

456
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
One of them is.

457
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Timer chance.

458
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,000
With.

459
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
With void skills.

460
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And this does not.

461
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Account for.

462
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The.

463
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Chance on individual skills.

464
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So this is like.

465
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The global stat.

466
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So if you have.

467
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Like Warpath.

468
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Let's say you had like.

469
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
100% chance.

470
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That wouldn't apply for this.

471
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So this is just.

472
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Globally from like.

473
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Passive skill trees.

474
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Sorry.

475
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Not skill trees.

476
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Gear like idols.

477
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Or.

478
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
In this case again.

479
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Body armor and helmet.

480
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Because we made an affix for that.

481
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And then we have slow.

482
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Because that's very thematic.

483
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Time Rot.

484
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's a time base.

485
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Right.

486
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So we have slow.

487
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And then.

488
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We have the.

489
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Lowest.

490
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Of I think it's attack.

491
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Cast and throwing.

492
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Speeds.

493
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So you have to invest.

494
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
In all of those three stats.

495
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And it picks the lowest.

496
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
As the multiplier.

497
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So there's a.

498
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You can make.

499
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You can get this.

500
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
To do some crazy damage now.

501
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Previously.

502
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It was just basically a debuff.

503
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
For some abilities.

504
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like.

505
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Erasing strike.

506
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Does like more damage.

507
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If enemy has 12 stacks of it.

508
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But now you can just.

509
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Make time rot.

510
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Actually do damage.

511
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Which is pretty exciting.

512
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No for sure.

513
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I mean this one's.

514
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Really really interesting.

515
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You guys were talking about this.

516
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
In the previous interview.

517
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
With spreading out.

518
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Some of the power.

519
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
From the sentinel.

520
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In general.

521
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
To create more of a.

522
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Balanced approach to it.

523
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Right.

524
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And this is one of those changes.

525
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
To allow the time rot.

526
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
To be more of a competitive damage.

527
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Approach.

528
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Right.

529
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's my understanding.

530
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,000
At least.

531
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yep.

532
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And.

533
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You will be able to see.

534
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You will be seeing.

535
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Time rot builds.

536
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
In season two.

537
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yes.

538
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You will definitely be seeing them.

539
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,000
For sure.

540
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's move over to another question.

541
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And that is.

542
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Well actually.

543
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Before we move over to the question.

544
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I do want to talk about.

545
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Damage every time.

546
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And ailments.

547
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We've seen the time rot stuff.

548
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Electrify.

549
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Are there any other.

550
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Changes to.

551
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Existing dots.

552
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Like frostbite.

553
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Or poison.

554
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
For example.

555
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't think we have.

556
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Any actual changes.

557
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
To any of those ailments.

558
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But as.

559
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We create more items.

560
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That support those ailments.

561
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They can get better.

562
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Like.

563
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Bleed is.

564
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Bleed probably has the most.

565
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Amount of support.

566
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah.

567
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
From different ailments.

568
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's also because.

569
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah.

570
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Because that's.

571
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's available.

572
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
For basically every single class.

573
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,000
In the game.

574
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We have the electrify.

575
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That is very.

576
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Tied to just be in Balatin.

577
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We have frostbite.

578
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That is basically.

579
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Mage.

580
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Primalist.

581
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And now.

582
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We are.

583
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We are.

584
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Slowly.

585
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Adding some of that.

586
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Into.

587
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Into.

588
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Rogue.

589
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
With some of the.

590
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The changes.

591
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But yeah.

592
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Fair enough.

593
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,000
There.

594
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
There isn't.

595
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Any actual.

596
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Ailment.

597
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Changes to themselves.

598
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Dispatch.

599
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,000
All right.

600
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The base functionality.

601
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Of those ailments.

602
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Is staying the same.

603
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But there are.

604
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Other things.

605
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That can affect those.

606
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Coming.

607
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay.

608
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm excited to see.

609
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Moving over to the next topic.

610
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It is monoliths.

611
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Which is kind of like.

612
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The main theme.

613
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Of the season.

614
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Essentially.

615
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The end game.

616
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Right.

617
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So end game.

618
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Is being heavily focused.

619
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
For this specific.

620
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Seasonal launch.

621
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And I guess the question.

622
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
One of the small questions.

623
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We can start with here.

624
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Is.

625
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Will we have.

626
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Player agency.

627
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Control over.

628
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Manually.

629
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Using individual.

630
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Monoliths.

631
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Like examples.

632
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Could be like.

633
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Scarabs.

634
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Or Deliores.

635
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,000
And PoE.

636
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
For example.

637
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Is that something.

638
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You guys are planning to do?

639
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes.

640
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes.

641
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
To elaborate.

642
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Do you want to take this?

643
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah.

644
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I can talk about.

645
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So.

646
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah.

647
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The.

648
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
One of the.

649
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
One of the main key features.

650
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Of.

651
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Of this.

652
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Of this patch.

653
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And this.

654
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
This whole season.

655
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Is.

656
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Woven echoes.

657
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And those are.

658
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Specific activities.

659
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That you know.

660
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What they're going to be.

661
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You can see what they're going to be.

662
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You can.

663
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And you.

664
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You physically place them.

665
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Into your.

666
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Into your timeline.

667
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Echo web.

668
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Web.

669
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Um.

670
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And.

671
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You.

672
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can.

673
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Make new paths.

674
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Opening up with them.

675
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You can connect nodes.

676
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That you're like.

677
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Oh.

678
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't want to go through this one.

679
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I want to go around it.

680
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You can make.

681
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Paths around it now.

682
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Um.

683
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And there's.

684
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,000
They.

685
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
They are itemized.

686
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So they are things that you are.

687
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Going to be finding out in the world.

688
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Uh.

689
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And as you find them.

690
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You'll be able to be like.

691
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay.

692
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Now I've got one of these.

693
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
In my pocket.

694
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I can go do this whenever I want.

695
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Uh.

696
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And you can start it.

697
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It.

698
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It.

699
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Sits into the web.

700
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It sort of behaves.

701
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Uh.

702
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It.

703
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It.

704
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Respects the distance from the center.

705
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Modifiers.

706
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And corruption modifiers.

707
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Um.

708
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And.

709
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And all of those apply to it.

710
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So you can.

711
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You can juice up some pretty sweet stuff there.

712
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
If you want.

713
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Uh.

714
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Not quite in the same.

715
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I should probably shouldn't have used that word.

716
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Not in the same sense.

717
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
That you can use it in other systems.

718
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Um.

719
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But yeah.

720
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,000
There's.

721
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
There's a lot of.

722
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
There's a lot of customization.

723
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That you can have.

724
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,000
With.

725
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What content you're going to be tackling.

726
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That you just.

727
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Didn't have before.

728
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah.

729
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,000
To.

730
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
To add there a bit maybe.

731
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Uh.

732
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
We are not.

733
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We are.

734
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Not really keen on like.

735
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Super micro management.

736
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Stuff.

737
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Like.

738
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You know.

739
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Elder rings.

740
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Or.

741
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The old.

742
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Uh.

743
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Old sextants in POV.

744
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Or scarabs.

745
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Or delirium orbs.

746
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Like that.

747
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So we've been.

748
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's actually very.

749
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Challenging.

750
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
To try to come up with.

751
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Systems that allow you to do.

752
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That kind of.

753
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Choosing.

754
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,000
That.

755
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Doesn't.

756
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Devolve into.

757
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,000
This.

758
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Massive amount of.

759
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Preparation.

760
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
For every single.

761
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Area that you go to.

762
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We have.

763
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We have.

764
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Maybe.

765
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I think we have a few.

766
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Of the WoW and Echoes.

767
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That will.

768
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Have an impact on.

769
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Other WoW and Echoes.

770
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Like other other Echoes.

771
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Also.

772
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Sometimes in WoW and Echoes.

773
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
When you do them.

774
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But we don't.

775
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Have crazy plans.

776
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Or adding dispatch.

777
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Anything like that.

778
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That you would.

779
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Think of like scarabs.

780
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Or.

781
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Tablets.

782
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And towers in POV2.

783
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Or stuff like that.

784
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,000
We are.

785
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We are very on the.

786
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Go in.

787
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Have fun.

788
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Get out.

789
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Then you go into the next one.

790
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Instead of.

791
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Setting up.

792
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Half an hour.

793
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,000
To go in.

794
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And then.

795
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Do a bunch of stuff.

796
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Fair enough.

797
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
What you guys talked about.

798
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
In the teaser.

799
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Was shown.

800
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Stash.

801
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
The inventory tabs.

802
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Right.

803
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Can we assume.

804
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That these.

805
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
These juicers.

806
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
If you will.

807
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Will be available.

808
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,000
In a separate tab.

809
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Or will we have our inventory.

810
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Clogged up with these.

811
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Every single WoW.

812
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Echoes has a slot.

813
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
On the tab.

814
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yes.

815
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Just to verify.

816
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah.

817
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
They each have their own.

818
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Individual slots.

819
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,000
That they go into.

820
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And there's an option.

821
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
To have them go directly.

822
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
There automatically.

823
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Without having to sort them.

824
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
There manually.

825
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,000
They just go in.

826
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They never touch your inventory.

827
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,000
If you don't want them to.

828
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If you do want them to go into.

829
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Your inventory.

830
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Or you can.

831
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay.

832
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So you can move them out.

833
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
If you want to.

834
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Okay.

835
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah.

836
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I like that.

837
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You can.

838
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah.

839
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You can.

840
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You can.

841
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You can.

842
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I think it's shift right click.

843
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You can just spam those.

844
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And they will be dropped.

845
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
From the inventory.

846
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,000
To the ground.

847
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If you want to.

848
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And obviously.

849
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You can just pick them up.

850
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
On the inventory.

851
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And then press the button.

852
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
To slurp them in.

853
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
At the same time.

854
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
If you like that.

855
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,000
But yeah.

856
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
They will all.

857
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Be with you.

858
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
All the time.

859
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And I think.

860
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's also.

861
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Shared between the stash.

862
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So yeah.

863
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You'll just.

864
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Have them there with you.

865
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
All the time.

866
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It should be stash linked.

867
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So yeah.

868
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So all of your like.

869
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Non-solo.

870
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Softcore characters.

871
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Have them.

872
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And all of your.

873
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Non-solo.

874
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Hardcore characters.

875
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Have a separate set.

876
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,000
They're not shared.

877
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Between those things.

878
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So everyone that shares a stash.

879
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Shares the.

880
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Woven Echoes.

881
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Stash.

882
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I do have a follow up question.

883
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I mean.

884
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It sounds great.

885
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And I love the idea.

886
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Player agency.

887
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Same thing with the whole.

888
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Shards being automatic.

889
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Couldn't assume.

890
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Crafting shards that is.

891
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Or you can choose to have them.

892
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,000
In your inventory.

893
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
To click the transfer button.

894
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I got.

895
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I have no idea.

896
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Who's psychopathic.

897
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Like the psychopaths.

898
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That would actually want to do that.

899
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But they exist.

900
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
However.

901
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
These things.

902
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Being.

903
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Itemized.

904
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,000
If you will.

905
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
To become an actual physical item.

906
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
If you will.

907
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That kind of.

908
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It brings up the question.

909
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Whether or not.

910
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Are they tradable.

911
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And giftable.

912
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
As well.

913
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
No.

914
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,000
They're not tradable.

915
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Or giftable.

916
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,000
However.

917
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Because you can.

918
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Bring anyone.

919
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Into your Echo Web.

920
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You can just.

921
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You can just start it.

922
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
In your Echo Web.

923
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And bring someone else with you.

924
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And they get the full benefits from it.

925
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So it's.

926
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,000
They're.

927
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
They're shareable.

928
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
In the sense that you can.

929
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Do them together.

930
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
In a party of people.

931
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But you can't.

932
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Physically.

933
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Just be like.

934
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Here you go.

935
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You go take this one.

936
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
They're not going to be for sale.

937
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
On the auction.

938
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,000
On the bazaar.

939
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah.

940
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
They are locked.

941
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Their character.

942
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Or their account bound.

943
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But yeah.

944
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah.

945
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's the same case.

946
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
For everything that.

947
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Is a.

948
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Like an unmodifiable item.

949
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Like runes.

950
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Shards.

951
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Stuff like that.

952
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
We could.

953
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Go into a very.

954
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Deep rabbit hole.

955
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Discussing.

956
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Why that is.

957
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But there is a world where.

958
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Those might be tradable.

959
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
In the future.

960
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But it regards some big changes to.

961
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
How.

962
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Item factions work.

963
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh.

964
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It is.

965
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It is something that is.

966
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Technically possible.

967
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But it runs into some.

968
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Some design problems.

969
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But yeah.

970
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
We'll.

971
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Maybe.

972
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Maybe we'll talk about it.

973
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,000
At some point.

974
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
We'll get there.

975
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,000
All right.

976
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Moving over to the next part.

977
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Of the end game.

978
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Is the.

979
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Current state of bosses.

980
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Have a ward system.

981
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That prevents them from.

982
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Essentially getting one shot.

983
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And or kill too fast.

984
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There's obviously a lot of comments.

985
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Around the system.

986
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Including things like.

987
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Culling strike.

988
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Where you execute the monster.

989
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
At a certain life threshold.

990
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Having a severely diminished value.

991
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
As a result of this.

992
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And it's considered more often.

993
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
A moment of frustration.

994
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So the question of this is.

995
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
How is the system going to be changing.

996
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The new season.

997
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If at all.

998
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Well yeah.

999
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
First of all.

1000
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It doesn't actually.

1001
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Like full one shot prevention.

1002
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's not there.

1003
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Like if you hit it hard enough.

1004
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That you can deal enough damage.

1005
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
For it's all of its health.

1006
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And all of the ward bars.

1007
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
All at the same time.

1008
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It will just one shot it.

1009
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Like so that is.

1010
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That is technically possible to do.

1011
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You can one shot them.

1012
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If you have enough damage up front.

1013
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It doesn't create like.

1014
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Spots where it just like.

1015
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Removes all damage off.

1016
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And then you have to start over.

1017
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Or something like that.

1018
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But yeah.

1019
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's it is.

1020
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's a.

1021
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
It's a hotly debated topic.

1022
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,000
For sure.

1023
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And it's.

1024
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It is providing.

1025
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We think.

1026
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
A very important functionality.

1027
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,000
To.

1028
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
To the end game system.

1029
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But at the same time.

1030
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It is.

1031
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Showing up in a lot of places.

1032
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That it doesn't need to.

1033
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So we are.

1034
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
We're removing it from.

1035
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Almost.

1036
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The vast majority of.

1037
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Of cases that are.

1038
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That have it.

1039
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's not going to be there anymore.

1040
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's just going to be a straight health bar.

1041
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Like normal.

1042
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And then in the.

1043
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The more significant.

1044
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Like really.

1045
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Really.

1046
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Grandiose.

1047
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Boss fights.

1048
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Those are going to still have.

1049
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
A boss ward system.

1050
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Because.

1051
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And.

1052
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And what it really does.

1053
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Is it does help.

1054
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Those.

1055
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Those builds that are.

1056
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You know.

1057
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Maybe struggling to do.

1058
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Is quite as much damage.

1059
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,000
To get.

1060
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
To get those boss fights.

1061
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
A little bit quicker.

1062
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So when you say.

1063
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That like.

1064
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,000
There's a clear.

1065
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,000
There's a line.

1066
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Where.

1067
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,000
They don't.

1068
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They're not needed.

1069
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Now they're needed.

1070
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We don't have to go into the detail of it.

1071
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But I guess.

1072
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The only question I have.

1073
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Is.

1074
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Does this mean.

1075
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That the campaign bosses.

1076
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Do not have this ward system anymore.

1077
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I think it's on some.

1078
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Campaign bosses.

1079
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Is.

1080
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But it's nowhere close to.

1081
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
As what you're used to seeing.

1082
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Okay.

1083
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Fair enough.

1084
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I think that's a good change.

1085
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah.

1086
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Also for the.

1087
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
For the.

1088
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's very scary.

1089
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

1090
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Sorry.

1091
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah.

1092
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Also for the kill.

1093
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Kill threshold part of that question.

1094
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We think it's a good thing.

1095
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Because it's very.

1096
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Very powerful.

1097
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So it actually.

1098
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Doing that.

1099
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Is.

1100
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah.

1101
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's a good thing that it.

1102
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Produces the power of that a bit.

1103
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Fair enough.

1104
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah.

1105
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Kill threshold is.

1106
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Is really.

1107
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's almost mandatory.

1108
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Without.

1109
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Without a system like this.

1110
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And even with it.

1111
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's still crazy powerful.

1112
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But that's not like a bad thing to have.

1113
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
That you need to slot in.

1114
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Because basically every class.

1115
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Does have access to it.

1116
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,000
In some way or another.

1117
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That's true.

1118
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Another end game question.

1119
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Or model of the question.

1120
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Is.

1121
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
A rather big one.

1122
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Covering corruption in general.

1123
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So favor farming.

1124
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Which is also impacting.

1125
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Item acquisition.

1126
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Experience gain.

1127
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And LP item chances.

1128
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
For example.

1129
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And most importantly.

1130
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Favor farming.

1131
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Being such a big factor.

1132
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
In how you progress your characters.

1133
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It seems very heavily favored.

1134
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Around a 1000 corruption.

1135
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
At the moment.

1136
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,000
In the current state of the game.

1137
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
At least.

1138
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So I guess the question.

1139
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Comes down to what the intended.

1140
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Corruption.

1141
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
That EHG.

1142
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Wants people to consider.

1143
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
To be the actual.

1144
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,000
End game.

1145
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
For good.

1146
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And great.

1147
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Or beyond builds.

1148
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Before Mike goes.

1149
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
On a rant here.

1150
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
One thing that we didn't say.

1151
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
About the boss word.

1152
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Is that it also just.

1153
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Decays faster.

1154
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,000
No.

1155
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh.

1156
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That's even better.

1157
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Thank you.

1158
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Carp and I debate this.

1159
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We were prepping for this.

1160
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
We actually got into a bit of a.

1161
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Debate on this topic ourselves.

1162
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So it's something that is.

1163
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You know.

1164
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,000
We.

1165
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It's not always cut and dry.

1166
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
On what the best idea is.

1167
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And I think.

1168
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
As long as there's like.

1169
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Crazy.

1170
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Like extreme.

1171
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Outlier builds.

1172
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There's going to be.

1173
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's going to be.

1174
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's going to be a bit of an issue.

1175
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And bringing those extreme.

1176
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Outlier builds down.

1177
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Is probably the most important part of.

1178
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Balancing this.

1179
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I think.

1180
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So where would you say.

1181
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
A good.

1182
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
End game build.

1183
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
What is the considered.

1184
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
End game corruption level.

1185
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
From the ESG standpoint.

1186
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I would say.

1187
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
If you have a build.

1188
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You go ahead.

1189
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Sorry.

1190
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'll go.

1191
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Yeah.

1192
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,000
If you.

1193
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah.

1194
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Like I was about to say.

1195
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's very hard to quantify that.

1196
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Because there's so many things.

1197
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That you can do with your builds.

1198
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And.

1199
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
If you make nothing but bad decisions.

1200
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
With your builds.

1201
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It probably shouldn't be able to do.

1202
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
A certain amount of corruption.

1203
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,000
And.

1204
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
We want there to be.

1205
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Options for people to also.

1206
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Make.

1207
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Bad builds.

1208
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Because if you can't make a bad build.

1209
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You can't really make a good build.

1210
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Because everything is the same.

1211
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,000
As for.

1212
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Let's say that you have a.

1213
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You know.

1214
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
A decent understanding of the game.

1215
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And how to make a build.

1216
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
If.

1217
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It can.

1218
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Comfortably do like.

1219
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,000
300 corruption.

1220
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'd call it a successful build.

1221
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,000
But.

1222
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The.

1223
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
The amount of.

1224
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
With so many topics right now.

1225
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
In my mind right now.

1226
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So.

1227
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
When we're talking about the.

1228
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Like the favor.

1229
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Farbic and whatnot.

1230
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
We already have.

1231
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Timidish returns.

1232
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Starting from.

1233
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I think.

1234
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Is it like 300 corruption.

1235
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Then 500 corruption.

1236
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And then finally on the.

1237
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The thousand mark.

1238
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The.

1239
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The benefits you get.

1240
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
From each point of corruption.

1241
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
For experience.

1242
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Matters a lot less.

1243
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So.

1244
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So.

1245
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And then there's the question of.

1246
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay.

1247
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Should at some point.

1248
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
There be no.

1249
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Nothing anymore.

1250
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The only thing that matters anymore.

1251
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Like.

1252
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
When corruption arises.

1253
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The only thing that goes up.

1254
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Is the difficulty.

1255
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
If we were to do that.

1256
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Now.

1257
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We are setting.

1258
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,000
A.

1259
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Very specific.

1260
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Threshold.

1261
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
That.

1262
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Means viability.

1263
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
For every single build in the game.

1264
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
If it's.

1265
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,000
At.

1266
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,000
500.

1267
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
There's a lot of viable builds.

1268
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
If it's at a thousand.

1269
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Suddenly.

1270
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
There's a lot less viable builds.

1271
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
If it's at a two thousand.

1272
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So.

1273
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's.

1274
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,000
We'd rather.

1275
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Not.

1276
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't want to say not punish.

1277
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
We rather.

1278
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Reward people.

1279
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
For being able to do.

1280
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Higher difficulty.

1281
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
But it's just a question.

1282
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like.

1283
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,000
There's a balance of.

1284
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
How much should they be rewarded for.

1285
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And that's why we do have.

1286
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The diminishing returns.

1287
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Maybe those.

1288
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Should be.

1289
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Higher.

1290
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Maybe the corruption scaling.

1291
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Should be.

1292
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Faster.

1293
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Than it is right now.

1294
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
There's a lot of.

1295
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Questions around this.

1296
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Just ignoring the balance.

1297
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
There's a lot of like.

1298
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Pure design.

1299
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Questions here.

1300
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That.

1301
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Needs to be answered.

1302
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Before you get.

1303
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Undecided on.

1304
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Before you can get.

1305
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Proper.

1306
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Decisions made there.

1307
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And we have people.

1308
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Like.

1309
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,000
We have.

1310
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We debate this a lot.

1311
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Internally.

1312
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So yeah.

1313
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's also about.

1314
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
There's an important factor here.

1315
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
About the.

1316
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The time it takes.

1317
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,000
To.

1318
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
To get that corruption.

1319
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,000
As well.

1320
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So.

1321
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,000
At some point.

1322
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
If it is a.

1323
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Like.

1324
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Like.

1325
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
What paths you have to.

1326
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
How fast you can increase your corruption.

1327
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And how.

1328
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
How long that actually takes.

1329
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Of gameplay time.

1330
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because if you are.

1331
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
We want you to stay challenged.

1332
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
We want you to stay.

1333
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
That's the important thing.

1334
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Is that you are still being challenged.

1335
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
As you're.

1336
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
As you're advancing.

1337
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The.

1338
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,000
The difficulty of content.

1339
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That you're.

1340
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Like.

1341
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Able to do.

1342
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So you get more powerful.

1343
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But you still get.

1344
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Challenged.

1345
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because you still have more.

1346
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Challenges to take on.

1347
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And having.

1348
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Having that.

1349
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Curve.

1350
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Feel good.

1351
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Is.

1352
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Is.

1353
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Is really important.

1354
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That's fair.

1355
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I mean.

1356
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,000
My.

1357
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Next question.

1358
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Was to talk about.

1359
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The time requirement.

1360
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
In moving from normal monos.

1361
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
To corrupted ones.

1362
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But before I touch you.

1363
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
That I want to verify.

1364
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
One question.

1365
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
In the current state.

1366
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Of the game.

1367
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,000
The.

1368
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Apparote.

1369
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The big endgame.

1370
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Pinnacle boss.

1371
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Is something you unlock.

1372
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
At 300 corruption.

1373
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Now.

1374
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,000
We're.

1375
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Being told that.

1376
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That fight is going to be made.

1377
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Slightly easier.

1378
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And the power.

1379
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Free power scaling.

1380
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Your character is going to go up a bit.

1381
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
As well.

1382
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Like the very ground.

1383
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Is going to move up.

1384
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The bar.

1385
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
With these things in mind.

1386
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Are we going to still see.

1387
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
This first initial version.

1388
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Of Abarth.

1389
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Being at 300 corruption.

1390
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's not changing.

1391
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah.

1392
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Okay.

1393
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah.

1394
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That's not changing.

1395
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And it's still going to be.

1396
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
There isn't many.

1397
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Like.

1398
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Nerfs to it.

1399
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's still going to be.

1400
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
A challenging fight.

1401
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
For a lot of.

1402
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,000
People.

1403
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And builds.

1404
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That aren't like.

1405
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Super optimized.

1406
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's still going to be.

1407
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
A difficult fight.

1408
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah.

1409
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Bringing a homebrew build.

1410
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,000
To Abarth.

1411
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
As you've just finished.

1412
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
300 corruption.

1413
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Is going to be.

1414
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
A very significant achievement.

1415
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
To be able to do.

1416
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Um.

1417
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Right.

1418
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Right now.

1419
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Most people are hitting 300.

1420
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Trying Abarth.

1421
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And being like.

1422
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm nowhere near powerful enough.

1423
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I've got to farm a bunch at 300.

1424
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And I'm actually going.

1425
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Significantly above 300.

1426
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Before I'm able to do Abarth.

1427
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Um.

1428
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And so you're still going to be.

1429
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Probably still.

1430
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Like.

1431
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Still going in.

1432
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Immediately after.

1433
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Completing 300.

1434
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And immediately unlocking it.

1435
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,000
If you're.

1436
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
If you're not on a.

1437
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
A heavily optimized build.

1438
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's still going to be very.

1439
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Very.

1440
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Significant accomplishment.

1441
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,000
To be able to.

1442
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Complete it right away.

1443
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's also.

1444
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
A very interesting.

1445
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Discussion that.

1446
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
We originally had.

1447
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The Abarth access.

1448
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I think it was.

1449
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
500 or 600 corruption.

1450
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Uh.

1451
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And we got a lot of feedback.

1452
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,000
That.

1453
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Uh.

1454
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It would be fun.

1455
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
To be able to.

1456
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Attempt the fight.

1457
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Much earlier.

1458
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Even.

1459
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Even.

1460
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
If the difficulty.

1461
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Of the fight.

1462
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Isn't.

1463
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Quite correspondent.

1464
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The.

1465
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
When you have access to it.

1466
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So.

1467
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,000
If.

1468
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Abarth took like.

1469
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I don't know.

1470
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
600 corruption.

1471
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It would take you.

1472
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
A bit longer.

1473
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,000
To get to.

1474
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You would have.

1475
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You would have.

1476
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Easier time.

1477
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Fighting it.

1478
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Because if you can do.

1479
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,000
600 corruption.

1480
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You're going to have.

1481
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
A lot easier time.

1482
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Fighting Abarth as well.

1483
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
But we wanted.

1484
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And that's also why.

1485
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
We provide you like.

1486
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Ten.

1487
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Harbinger eyes.

1488
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
For testing.

1489
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Like attempting it.

1490
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
If you really want to.

1491
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Push yourself.

1492
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And try to learn the fight.

1493
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Already immediately.

1494
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
At that point.

1495
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So.

1496
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Okay.

1497
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
That's fair.

1498
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So what about.

1499
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The time requirement.

1500
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
On your very first character.

1501
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
There are catch up mechanics.

1502
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
In your alts.

1503
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But the time requirement.

1504
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
In moving from normal monos.

1505
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Into the corrupted versions.

1506
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
On your first character.

1507
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
What's the changes.

1508
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Happening there.

1509
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,000
If any.

1510
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I think the only changes.

1511
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,000
For that.

1512
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Come from.

1513
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The weaver tree.

1514
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I don't think.

1515
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
If we have any other changes.

1516
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Coming.

1517
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But you can specialize.

1518
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Weaver tree.

1519
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,000
A bit.

1520
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So that you can get there.

1521
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Faster.

1522
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Not by much.

1523
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But it's already.

1524
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Pretty fast.

1525
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
If you just push one.

1526
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Timeline.

1527
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
With the mechanics.

1528
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
That exist in game.

1529
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Like.

1530
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Cliff of Envy.

1531
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And then you use the catch up.

1532
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Mechanic.

1533
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
For the other timelines.

1534
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,000
It's.

1535
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's.

1536
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It's surprisingly fast.

1537
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Already.

1538
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And.

1539
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Speaking of the alts.

1540
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We are adding.

1541
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Couple.

1542
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Couple new cool things.

1543
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
For.

1544
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Alts.

1545
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
To be faster.

1546
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So.

1547
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The.

1548
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Normal timeline.

1549
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Is now shared.

1550
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So if you have a character.

1551
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,000
In.

1552
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Empowered Monoliths.

1553
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And you make an old character.

1554
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You don't need to go through.

1555
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,000
All of them anymore.

1556
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You just go do one of the.

1557
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Nineties.

1558
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I believe.

1559
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And.

1560
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You go.

1561
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Straight to empowered.

1562
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Again.

1563
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,000
If you want to.

1564
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
That is a massive change.

1565
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah.

1566
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yes.

1567
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And then.

1568
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The other one is.

1569
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
We had.

1570
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Items to push corruption faster.

1571
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But.

1572
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Let's say that you have.

1573
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Let's say that you have.

1574
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That one character.

1575
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,000
A thousand corruption.

1576
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah.

1577
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It can feel a bit daunting.

1578
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,000
To think.

1579
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Okay.

1580
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
If I have like.

1581
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
This crazy gear.

1582
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Prepared for my next character.

1583
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And you just want to go.

1584
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You know.

1585
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Fight.

1586
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Actual harder.

1587
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Harder corner with that.

1588
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It takes a while.

1589
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
To get back to the thousand.

1590
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So.

1591
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
One of the Bowen echoes.

1592
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Allows you to.

1593
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Catch up corruption.

1594
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
From the highest corruption.

1595
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,000
In the stash.

1596
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So.

1597
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
If you have one character.

1598
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
A thousand corruption.

1599
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And then you make the alt.

1600
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Once you complete the Bowen echo.

1601
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It gets to that corruption.

1602
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That the builder character was.

1603
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh.

1604
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That's also really big.

1605
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That's a good change.

1606
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That's very big.

1607
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
That's very big.

1608
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yes.

1609
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And that's something that you can farm.

1610
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
On the first character.

1611
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And then use on the second character.

1612
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Still.

1613
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Because it's shared across the stash.

1614
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
As well.

1615
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Nice.

1616
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The only.

1617
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The only play more.

1618
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
That doesn't have that.

1619
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Is if you're playing.

1620
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Solo character found.

1621
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Because it.

1622
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's like actual.

1623
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Full individual character.

1624
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And stash.

1625
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
With nothing shared.

1626
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But solo accounts found.

1627
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And then just.

1628
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
No challenges.

1629
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Past that.

1630
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Yeah.

1631
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Yeah.

1632
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It is.

1633
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It is stash shared.

1634
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So yeah.

1635
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Everything.

1636
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
As long as the two characters.

1637
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Have the same.

1638
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Access to the same stash.

1639
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Then they will have.

1640
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,000
This mechanic.

1641
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Working with them.

1642
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That's fair.

1643
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
One of the questions.

1644
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
We have in the list.

1645
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Is the massive amount.

1646
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Of extra content.

1647
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Included in the new season.

1648
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And the question.

1649
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Was about.

1650
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,000
If whether or not.

1651
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Capping corruption.

1652
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Scaling.

1653
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Have been brought back to the table.

1654
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But we kind of already.

1655
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Covered that part.

1656
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So I'm just going to skip that one.

1657
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And instead.

1658
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Bring up another question.

1659
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Which is from another.

1660
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Last Apoch creator.

1661
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Called Lizard.

1662
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
IRL.

1663
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And he was.

1664
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Talking about.

1665
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The idea of the.

1666
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Expectant.

1667
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Approach.

1668
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The EHG.

1669
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Has to the game.

1670
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The question goes as follows.

1671
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And that is that.

1672
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
A lot of us are rather interested.

1673
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
In hearing this.

1674
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And it's to circle back.

1675
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
To a commonly asked question.

1676
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
From the past.

1677
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And that is to ask.

1678
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
What the expected.

1679
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,000
DPS.

1680
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Threshold.

1681
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,000
EHD.

1682
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Wants players to reach.

1683
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,000
To handle.

1684
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
X amount of corruption.

1685
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So essentially.

1686
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What I'm trying to get.

1687
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Here is.

1688
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It seems like.

1689
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
The expected.

1690
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Endgame approach.

1691
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Is to make the normal.

1692
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Version of Abarth.

1693
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Be a fight.

1694
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Most people can handle.

1695
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Or if not all people.

1696
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Can handle this.

1697
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So I guess.

1698
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The question.

1699
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,000
To come down.

1700
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
To actually get.

1701
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
A proper question.

1702
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Out of this rant.

1703
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
With me.

1704
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Rambling on.

1705
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Is there a DPS.

1706
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Threshold.

1707
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That you guys.

1708
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Want people to achieve.

1709
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
At say.

1710
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The Abarth fights.

1711
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And the short answer.

1712
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Is no.

1713
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
We don't have.

1714
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
A really fixed.

1715
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
A fixed DPS.

1716
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
That we've.

1717
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Like.

1718
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Gone and measured.

1719
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Like.

1720
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Oh.

1721
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
This character.

1722
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,000
With this type of build.

1723
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Can do this much DPS.

1724
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Or anything like that.

1725
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
We don't strictly.

1726
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Like.

1727
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Just measure DPS.

1728
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And compare that.

1729
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
From build to build.

1730
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
As a balancing metric.

1731
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Really.

1732
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Because there's lots of things.

1733
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Lots of secondary effects.

1734
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That builds do.

1735
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Like.

1736
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Abilities they have access to.

1737
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,000
That can.

1738
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Really change.

1739
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,000
How they perform.

1740
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
In different situations.

1741
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So like.

1742
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,000
If.

1743
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
As an example.

1744
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I guess.

1745
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
If a boss.

1746
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Is applying slow to you.

1747
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And your build.

1748
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Because you've gone full glass can.

1749
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And full DPS.

1750
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And you don't have a way.

1751
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
To cleanse that slow.

1752
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You can't really complete.

1753
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That fight effectively.

1754
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Maybe you're like.

1755
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Okay.

1756
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I have to go rethink my build.

1757
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,000
A little bit.

1758
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And I've got to.

1759
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Take some DPS away.

1760
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And.

1761
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Suddenly.

1762
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So you have like.

1763
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,000
A way to get.

1764
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Cleansing into your build.

1765
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And suddenly.

1766
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
This build.

1767
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
That has less DPS.

1768
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Is actually better.

1769
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Overall.

1770
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And so.

1771
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Like.

1772
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Strictly just DPS.

1773
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Isn't.

1774
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It doesn't tell the whole story.

1775
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And it does.

1776
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I guess it is.

1777
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Something that we can use.

1778
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
To like.

1779
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Get a view of.

1780
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Some parts of what the build can do.

1781
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And it is probably the most important part.

1782
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Of what a lot of builds can do.

1783
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,000
But.

1784
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Once you get into really.

1785
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Really heavy late game.

1786
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Defenses and utility.

1787
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Become more and more.

1788
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And more and more.

1789
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And more important.

1790
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And so we don't.

1791
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Really want to put a number out there.

1792
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
To say like.

1793
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
This is what we expect your.

1794
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Your DPS to be.

1795
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
At any point.

1796
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And we don't have good tools.

1797
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,000
For our players.

1798
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
To measure their DPS.

1799
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Strictly as well.

1800
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
So it's.

1801
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Especially character to character.

1802
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Comparison.

1803
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yeah.

1804
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah.

1805
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Target dummies.

1806
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Being in the game.

1807
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's like.

1808
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Just a little.

1809
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Side question to that.

1810
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Is there any ideas.

1811
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Or are you guys against.

1812
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,000
The idea of adding.

1813
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Like a DPS.

1814
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Meter check.

1815
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
On the target dummies.

1816
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Is that something you guys.

1817
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Would consider.

1818
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's.

1819
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It gets suggested.

1820
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Pretty frequently.

1821
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's not something.

1822
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
We're interested in right now.

1823
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Okay.

1824
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Moving on.

1825
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
To talk about the portals.

1826
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Which I think.

1827
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Is a really cool way.

1828
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Or a nice way.

1829
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
To provide a.

1830
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Key sync.

1831
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,000
If you will.

1832
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I think that having a.

1833
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Currency sync.

1834
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Of the different.

1835
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Currency is very important.

1836
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
In ARPTs in general.

1837
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And.

1838
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But it does bring up.

1839
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The question of.

1840
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,000
How valuable.

1841
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Running the actual.

1842
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Dungeons will be.

1843
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Because the portal.

1844
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Will just take you.

1845
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Straight to the boss room.

1846
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,000
For example.

1847
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Jewelry.

1848
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,000
If you go through.

1849
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Different doors.

1850
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You get to choose.

1851
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Right.

1852
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
This door.

1853
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Allows you.

1854
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,000
The boss.

1855
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,000
To drop.

1856
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,000
X amount of extra.

1857
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Exalted items.

1858
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And this one says.

1859
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Well now you're going to drop.

1860
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Extra glyphs or whatever.

1861
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So the question would be.

1862
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Are the portals.

1863
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Going to give you.

1864
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Random set of these.

1865
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Or you're just bypassing.

1866
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And the boss.

1867
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Will just give you.

1868
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Less loot.

1869
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,000
As a result of you.

1870
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Skipping the dungeon.

1871
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
No.

1872
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Has anyone.

1873
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Gone to a door.

1874
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And been like.

1875
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm going to see.

1876
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
What the other door.

1877
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Actually has.

1878
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And like go back.

1879
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Through the maze.

1880
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
The other one.

1881
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And check it.

1882
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And be like.

1883
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
No the first one was better.

1884
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm going to go back that way.

1885
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
No one does that.

1886
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Ever.

1887
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You get to the door.

1888
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And you're like.

1889
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yep.

1890
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'll take that one.

1891
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Whatever it is.

1892
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I guess that's what I got.

1893
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So yeah.

1894
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We are.

1895
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
We are.

1896
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The portal charm.

1897
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Does pick one of them.

1898
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Randomly for you.

1899
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
So you do still get those.

1900
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Mods.

1901
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
And so it doesn't affect.

1902
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The actual.

1903
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Final outcome.

1904
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Of your rewards.

1905
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
For the dungeon.

1906
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Also important.

1907
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
That it does that.

1908
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Because those modifiers.

1909
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Are also.

1910
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Buffing the boss.

1911
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Yes.

1912
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So.

1913
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Follow up.

1914
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
We actually.

1915
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,000
We actually had a bug.

1916
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,000
We had a bug.

1917
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah.

1918
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Where they weren't applying.

1919
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So.

1920
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Using a portal charm.

1921
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
To go fight dungeon bosses.

1922
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Was actually the optimal way.

1923
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
If you just wanted to kill it.

1924
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Because it was easier.

1925
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Because the mod weren't applying to it.

1926
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So.

1927
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yeah.

1928
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And we are bringing.

1929
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Like random things.

1930
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Into the dungeons as well.

1931
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So like there are.

1932
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You like.

1933
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
A loot lizard can spawn in a dungeon.

1934
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And like.

1935
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So there are things like that.

1936
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
That can happen in there as well.

1937
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So my follow up questions.

1938
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Is more than about.

1939
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
The actual value of running it.

1940
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
When we have access.

1941
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
To just skipping straight to the boss.

1942
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And we get the juicing up.

1943
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Of the loot.

1944
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
With difficulty added.

1945
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,000
What's the point.

1946
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,000
In running the dungeon then?

1947
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I mean.

1948
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Maybe you don't have a portal charm yet?

1949
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You don't have a portal charm.

1950
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Okay.

1951
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Because I mean.

1952
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Are there plans.

1953
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
To adding more content.

1954
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Inside these dungeons.

1955
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
To make them more attractive.

1956
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
For people to choose to run.

1957
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Rather than skipping.

1958
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I was about to ask Gassi.

1959
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
How many times have you actually.

1960
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Farmed the dungeon.

1961
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
For the purpose of farming the dungeon.

1962
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And not.

1963
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Whatever is at the end.

1964
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Of the dungeon.

1965
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Oh.

1966
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The boss uniques.

1967
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Or the.

1968
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah.

1969
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You're going like.

1970
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Way back.

1971
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You're going like.

1972
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Multiple years back now.

1973
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
If you're saying.

1974
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
The temporal sanctum.

1975
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Was good for like.

1976
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Belts.

1977
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Or boots.

1978
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Or stuff like that.

1979
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You're going way back.

1980
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Then.

1981
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I was about to say that.

1982
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yes.

1983
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Yes.

1984
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
We.

1985
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah.

1986
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Eventually.

1987
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
But the dungeons.

1988
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Need to feel way better.

1989
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
From like.

1990
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,000
User experience.

1991
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Before we feel like.

1992
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's worth.

1993
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Making the reward so good.

1994
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Because.

1995
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
If something is really.

1996
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Unfun to do.

1997
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But.

1998
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It's the most rewarding.

1999
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
People are going to do it.

2000
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And they're going to.

2001
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Really hate.

2002
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Playing the game.

2003
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
While doing it.

2004
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So.

2005
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
The user experience.

2006
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
To be good.

2007
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Before.

2008
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Stuff like that.

2009
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Will happen.

2010
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And there is a bunch of tech.

2011
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You're going to see.

2012
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,000
In season two.

2013
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
For the tombs.

2014
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Especially.

2015
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
That I think we're going to be.

2016
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Looking to leverage.

2017
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
For dungeons in the future.

2018
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So.

2019
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
There's.

2020
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
There are a lot of things.

2021
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We want to do.

2022
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I feel like the dungeon system.

2023
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Is a really.

2024
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,000
There's a lot of.

2025
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Untapped potential there.

2026
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
For.

2027
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Interesting content.

2028
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
For.

2029
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Fun content.

2030
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,000
For.

2031
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Rewarding content.

2032
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
All these things to happen.

2033
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But.

2034
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,000
They're.

2035
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The quality of that experience.

2036
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Isn't.

2037
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
At a point where we want to.

2038
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Really.

2039
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Incentivize people to be.

2040
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Heavily interacting with it.

2041
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Like.

2042
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
We like.

2043
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Some light interaction there.

2044
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Because I think it's fun.

2045
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The first few times.

2046
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Especially.

2047
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And then.

2048
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Your.

2049
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,000
80th time.

2050
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Through the temporal sanctum.

2051
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And you're like.

2052
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Ah.

2053
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
This dead end again.

2054
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah.

2055
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,000
No.

2056
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I know that feeling.

2057
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
All too well.

2058
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Especially when you play.

2059
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Builds that wants it.

2060
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,000
You know.

2061
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Vessel's Drive.

2062
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Jewelers Obsession.

2063
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Mountain Helmet.

2064
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Etc.

2065
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,000
For the different dungeons.

2066
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Right.

2067
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
But let's move on to.

2068
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Class reworks.

2069
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
We've already.

2070
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Teased a little bit.

2071
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
With Electrify.

2072
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Time Rod.

2073
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Judgment.

2074
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Of the storm.

2075
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
We're going to talk a little bit more.

2076
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
About the Sentinel rework.

2077
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And.

2078
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
What I want to do.

2079
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Is take a moment.

2080
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
To take a.

2081
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
The cool things.

2082
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Aside.

2083
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Such as being able to wield.

2084
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,000
A two-handed weapon.

2085
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And a shield.

2086
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,000
For example.

2087
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's a cool thing.

2088
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
We'll take that aside.

2089
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So what's the approach.

2090
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,000
To the season.

2091
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
In making melee.

2092
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
A more attractive.

2093
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,000
A more attractive.

2094
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Playstyle.

2095
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Compared to the current meta.

2096
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Killing things.

2097
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Entire screens.

2098
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Actually.

2099
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Of monsters.

2100
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Just from afar.

2101
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Yeah.

2102
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I mean.

2103
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Do you want to talk?

2104
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Yeah.

2105
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Okay.

2106
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
You can go ahead.

2107
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
If you got something for this.

2108
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah.

2109
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yeah.

2110
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So.

2111
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I mean.

2112
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Obviously.

2113
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
We could make melee.

2114
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Every single skill.

2115
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Literally.

2116
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Hit the entire screen.

2117
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
But is it melee then?

2118
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Not really.

2119
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Right.

2120
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So.

2121
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It's a.

2122
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's like an age-old question.

2123
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
In RPGs.

2124
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,000
How.

2125
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Or in games in general.

2126
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,000
How.

2127
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Do you do that?

2128
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
There's.

2129
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,000
There's a.

2130
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
There's a lot of things.

2131
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You can do there.

2132
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Very.

2133
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Difficult.

2134
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And.

2135
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Time-consuming.

2136
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And whatnot.

2137
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I think.

2138
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
A lot of the stuff.

2139
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We're trying to do.

2140
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,000
With melee.

2141
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Is making the.

2142
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Like.

2143
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,000
The feel.

2144
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Of their abilities.

2145
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Feel a lot better.

2146
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So.

2147
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Like.

2148
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Getting more responsiveness.

2149
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And getting.

2150
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Like.

2151
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Better VFX.

2152
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Getting better SFX.

2153
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Things like that.

2154
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Having enemy reactions.

2155
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And like.

2156
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
A lot of those things.

2157
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
A lot of the.

2158
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Like.

2159
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Having.

2160
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Better fit and finish.

2161
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
On those.

2162
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Abilities.

2163
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Makes just playing them.

2164
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,000
A lot more fun.

2165
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And getting the power balance.

2166
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,000
In there.

2167
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
As far as how fast.

2168
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You can kill things.

2169
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Is.

2170
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Kind of a different conversation.

2171
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But is.

2172
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Maybe that's more.

2173
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
What people are interested in knowing.

2174
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Is like.

2175
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Can I just kill stuff faster.

2176
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,000
As melee.

2177
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And we are adding a ton.

2178
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Of.

2179
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Different ways to kill things faster.

2180
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
In melee.

2181
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I guess.

2182
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Especially in.

2183
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Especially in Sentinel right now.

2184
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,000
That's the big.

2185
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The big focus.

2186
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And like.

2187
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
We're getting.

2188
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
You know.

2189
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Abilities.

2190
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
There's lots of.

2191
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Abilities that we designed.

2192
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Specifically to.

2193
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Make you more efficient.

2194
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
On melee.

2195
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Focus classes.

2196
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So like.

2197
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Even just down to the base functionality.

2198
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Of lunge.

2199
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Where.

2200
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It.

2201
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Like.

2202
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You're targeting an enemy.

2203
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And it gets you right up close.

2204
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Really fast.

2205
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It is one of the fastest moving abilities.

2206
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It is.

2207
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,000
You know.

2208
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It's a very efficient movement ability.

2209
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
At engaging into close range combat.

2210
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And.

2211
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And.

2212
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Leaning into that as much as possible.

2213
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I think is.

2214
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Is the important part.

2215
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It's also very.

2216
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah.

2217
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It's also very difficult.

2218
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
To have like a global.

2219
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Something.

2220
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Something globally for melee.

2221
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
That doesn't bleed into.

2222
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Non-melee.

2223
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So.

2224
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Like.

2225
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,000
If you have.

2226
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Let's say that you have a.

2227
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Enemies near you.

2228
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Deal less damage.

2229
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Well then.

2230
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Every single ranged build.

2231
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Will just go into melee range of enemies.

2232
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Because now they deal less damage to it.

2233
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So it's.

2234
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It's very difficult.

2235
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,000
To.

2236
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Do something.

2237
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Especially for classes.

2238
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Like.

2239
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Like.

2240
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
We don't have a class.

2241
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,000
That is just melee.

2242
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Every class can.

2243
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Do other things.

2244
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,000
For example.

2245
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Sentinel.

2246
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Well.

2247
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,000
You have minions.

2248
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You have.

2249
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
You can do throwing.

2250
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You can do spells.

2251
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So.

2252
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's very difficult.

2253
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
To.

2254
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Buff the one side.

2255
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Without.

2256
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Accidentally bleeding.

2257
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Into others.

2258
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Obviously.

2259
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
We are.

2260
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,000
We are.

2261
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Looking into ways.

2262
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,000
To do that.

2263
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
But it's very.

2264
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Very difficult.

2265
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,000
To find something.

2266
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That works very well.

2267
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It also comes into.

2268
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Like.

2269
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Boss.

2270
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Like.

2271
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Like.

2272
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Enemy attacks as well.

2273
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,000
With.

2274
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
With having.

2275
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So like.

2276
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Someone.

2277
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Like.

2278
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The things that are.

2279
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Attacking you.

2280
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Being.

2281
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Having abilities.

2282
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
That they can use.

2283
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Only on.

2284
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Enemies that are.

2285
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
At long range.

2286
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And then incentivizing.

2287
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Characters that are not.

2288
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Melee characters.

2289
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
To stay at long range.

2290
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Through their own trees.

2291
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
So it's this.

2292
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
This tension that they have.

2293
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Of.

2294
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Okay.

2295
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
If I'm going to stay at range.

2296
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I'm going to get hit.

2297
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
With these abilities.

2298
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That melee won't get hit with.

2299
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Or that it's easier to dodge.

2300
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
In melee.

2301
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Because of the shape of the ability.

2302
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Or something like that.

2303
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yeah.

2304
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
We have a lot of.

2305
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Cone shaped.

2306
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Like.

2307
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You know.

2308
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Triangles.

2309
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So if you're close to the boss.

2310
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
You just take a small sidestep.

2311
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And you're out of it.

2312
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Whereas if you're far away from it.

2313
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
You have a very big distance.

2314
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
You have to go through.

2315
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I think a good example.

2316
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Is the Aberos.

2317
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Like the.

2318
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
The triple.

2319
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
The slam.

2320
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It hits front.

2321
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
And then the sides.

2322
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
If you're right next to it.

2323
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It's very easy to dodge.

2324
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It's pretty hard to take away from it.

2325
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So yeah.

2326
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
We had a question.

2327
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
From another LE content creator.

2328
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Perry the Pig.

2329
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Was talking about.

2330
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You know.

2331
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Beyond the melee play style.

2332
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
With the introduction of Uber Arborath.

2333
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
The question had.

2334
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Was about.

2335
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Having tools for melee players.

2336
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Utilized when it comes to.

2337
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Positional important fights.

2338
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Such as endgame pinnacles.

2339
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Like the new Aberos fight.

2340
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So you're saying that.

2341
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
With the way the abilities are designed.

2342
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It is.

2343
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Beneficial to be in melee range.

2344
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Which is more lucrative.

2345
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Or beneficial for melee players.

2346
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,000
In general.

2347
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That they don't seem to have.

2348
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
The need for any specific new tools.

2349
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
To mitigate damage.

2350
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Is that what I'm understanding?

2351
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
We'd like.

2352
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,000
We are.

2353
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
We're always exploring.

2354
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
The ways to actually do that.

2355
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
But a lot of it comes from.

2356
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Enemy ability design.

2357
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Yes.

2358
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
There's a lot to that.

2359
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah.

2360
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So Mike.

2361
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
You mentioned.

2362
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
There being tools added.

2363
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
To making it more effective.

2364
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
In terms of the power scaling in melee.

2365
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Because you talked about.

2366
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
SFX.

2367
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,000
VFX.

2368
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
All those things.

2369
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Making it feel good.

2370
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
But there's a difference.

2371
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Between the build feeling good.

2372
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And then.

2373
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Being put into the game.

2374
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And now it's being compared.

2375
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
To builds that are clearing.

2376
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Significantly faster.

2377
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Especially in the game.

2378
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,000
That is.

2379
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Incentivizing very heavily.

2380
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
On favor farming.

2381
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Which means clear speed matters a lot.

2382
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Minion builds.

2383
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Suffers from this as well.

2384
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
In terms of clear efficiency.

2385
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,000
You mentioned.

2386
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
There being.

2387
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Abilities.

2388
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Or.

2389
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Introductions of tools.

2390
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
That were the.

2391
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Toolkit for melee players.

2392
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
To utilize.

2393
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
To increase the efficiencies.

2394
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Is this something we see.

2395
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,000
In season two.

2396
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And if so.

2397
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,000
What.

2398
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Specific.

2399
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Specific examples.

2400
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,000
For season two.

2401
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I don't have anything.

2402
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Off the top of my head.

2403
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
That I can share right now.

2404
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Okay.

2405
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000
The.

2406
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I think it comes down to.

2407
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I think a lot of it right now.

2408
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Is.

2409
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,000
It's going to be like.

2410
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Small balance changes.

2411
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And I say small.

2412
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That'll have big impacts.

2413
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000
As things like.

2414
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't.

2415
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't.

2416
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't.

2417
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I don't have a good.

2418
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Fix.

2419
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
A hard example.

2420
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Something we're actually doing.

2421
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But as an example.

2422
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Something we could do.

2423
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Hypothetically.

2424
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Is like.

2425
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Even just taking a second.

2426
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Off the cooldown.

2427
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Of something like lunge.

2428
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Or giving you.

2429
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Or giving.

2430
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Less pressure.

2431
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,000
On.

2432
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
An item slot.

2433
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
That has.

2434
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Increased cooldown recovery.

2435
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,000
On it.

2436
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Or something like that.

2437
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Like there's.

2438
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
There's little things we can do.

2439
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
That either hit.

2440
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Like wide range of.

2441
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
A wide range of builds.

2442
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Or not.

2443
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So we can.

2444
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Maybe have.

2445
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Maybe there's like.

2446
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
An item slot.

2447
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Where.

2448
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Like cooldown recovery.

2449
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Exists.

2450
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And there's another.

2451
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
We put something else on there.

2452
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That's really good for.

2453
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Like long range characters.

2454
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And so they.

2455
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,000
They no longer want to get.

2456
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,000
That cooldown recovery.

2457
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So then.

2458
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Then their movement abilities.

2459
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Are slower.

2460
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So there's.

2461
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,000
That.

2462
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Like sometimes it's like.

2463
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
The pressure gets put on.

2464
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
These abilities.

2465
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And the balance from.

2466
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Like really far away.

2467
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Sometimes even.

2468
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And.

2469
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I.

2470
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I don't think that there's.

2471
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I don't think we're actually.

2472
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
That far away from.

2473
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Having melee feel really good to play.

2474
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
In a broader sense.

2475
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And I think that a lot of the changes.

2476
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,000
That we're making.

2477
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Bringing to.

2478
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Especially.

2479
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Things like volatile reversal.

2480
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And forge guard.

2481
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That the changes there.

2482
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Is so huge.

2483
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And we still got.

2484
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
We still have that to get into.

2485
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yeah.

2486
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Yeah.

2487
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Speaking of.

2488
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah.

2489
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Speaking of all the cool things.

2490
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Gazze.

2491
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
How hard would it be.

2492
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
For you to.

2493
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Just capture.

2494
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
If I actually show my screen.

2495
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I'm in a CT build right now.

2496
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And.

2497
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I.

2498
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I've been.

2499
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I'll make it work.

2500
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I have stupid stripping stuff.

2501
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So I don't leak anything crazy.

2502
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,000
But we could just.

2503
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
You know.

2504
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Show you some of the.

2505
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Start it up.

2506
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And I'll see if it screws it up.

2507
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And I'll fix it.

2508
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'll.

2509
00:54:59,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'll sort it.

2510
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Don't.

2511
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Don't.

2512
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Don't.

2513
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Don't tell anyone else.

2514
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Okay.

2515
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,000
It's just.

2516
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Sure.

2517
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
We're all.

2518
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
We're not going to say anything.

2519
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Let's see if I can.

2520
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yeah.

2521
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Because.

2522
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Model reversal.

2523
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Specifically.

2524
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Is like.

2525
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It is an.

2526
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's a.

2527
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's a.

2528
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Travels or ability.

2529
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That.

2530
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Doesn't regard a target.

2531
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Like a launch.

2532
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And isn't.

2533
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It doesn't regard a shield.

2534
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Like shield rush.

2535
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I mean.

2536
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Sure.

2537
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,000
You can.

2538
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Expect shield rush.

2539
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
To not have.

2540
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Not regard that.

2541
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
But it is.

2542
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
A mobility skill.

2543
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,000
For sentinel.

2544
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Which is.

2545
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Going to help.

2546
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And I've got some.

2547
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Other cool stuff.

2548
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Now.

2549
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Because we totally reworked.

2550
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
What the reversal is.

2551
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,000
So yeah.

2552
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,000
That's fair.

2553
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
If you.

2554
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Turn off your camera.

2555
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And then start the stream.

2556
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I think that will.

2557
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Actually add up perfectly.

2558
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yeah.

2559
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I mean.

2560
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
We can.

2561
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
We can try that.

2562
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Or just start the stream.

2563
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And I'll see.

2564
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I can just add.

2565
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Let's.

2566
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Let's.

2567
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Let's see.

2568
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
What if I just do this first.

2569
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Oh.

2570
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Beautiful sound.

2571
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I need to do this.

2572
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Let me do.

2573
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Yeah.

2574
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It's going to.

2575
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Screw it up completely.

2576
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Let me just add that.

2577
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Give me a sec.

2578
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You might want to just go full screen.

2579
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I think.

2580
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Maybe.

2581
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
A little easier.

2582
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,000
In a moment.

2583
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
That's the wrong one.

2584
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
In the capture.

2585
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Quick.

2586
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Before someone stops us.

2587
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah.

2588
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I had to like.

2589
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Take all of my idols out.

2590
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So I don't.

2591
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You know.

2592
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Leak anything.

2593
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Okay.

2594
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Your.

2595
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Your screen is now full screen.

2596
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,000
And then.

2597
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Then I.

2598
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And I had to replace.

2599
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,000
My.

2600
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Some of my items.

2601
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,000
To not.

2602
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
To just be the base set items.

2603
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Because.

2604
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,000
You know.

2605
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,000
You can.

2606
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yeah.

2607
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Anyways.

2608
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Okay.

2609
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So.

2610
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Voltar reversal.

2611
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Is now.

2612
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
A combo ability.

2613
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
That.

2614
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
First.

2615
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It jumps.

2616
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Forward in time.

2617
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And then.

2618
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
When you use it again.

2619
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It.

2620
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Goes back.

2621
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,000
And it does.

2622
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Some melee attack.

2623
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,000
On both.

2624
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Both cases.

2625
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I think.

2626
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I'm just going to.

2627
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Unspec this.

2628
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So I can.

2629
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,000
You can.

2630
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I can show you the default.

2631
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So.

2632
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
The first.

2633
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And then.

2634
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
If I do second.

2635
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It just slams backwards.

2636
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Where I was.

2637
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So.

2638
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It's.

2639
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's.

2640
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's.

2641
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It's pretty cool.

2642
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:07,000
It's.

2643
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's pretty cool.

2644
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
And you can do.

2645
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You can do some interesting stuff with it.

2646
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
For example.

2647
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Devouring Orb.

2648
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Has.

2649
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Some cool new.

2650
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
New tech here.

2651
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Where.

2652
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
You can consume.

2653
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
All other.

2654
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Orbs.

2655
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,000
So.

2656
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You actually have it here.

2657
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
If I just cast.

2658
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Devouring Orb.

2659
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Here.

2660
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Normally.

2661
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,000
If you cast another one.

2662
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It's just there.

2663
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But now.

2664
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
It consumes the other one.

2665
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And.

2666
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
It does more damage.

2667
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And it's bigger.

2668
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
As a result.

2669
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
One of the cool things here.

2670
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Is that.

2671
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,000
You can.

2672
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Bring them.

2673
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,000
With you.

2674
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
With the.

2675
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And.

2676
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
That means.

2677
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,000
That you can.

2678
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Like pile them up.

2679
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Into like.

2680
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,000
This one big.

2681
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Pool of stuff.

2682
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And then it does a lot more damage.

2683
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And there's.

2684
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Other.

2685
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Other interesting stuff.

2686
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Like.

2687
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You can.

2688
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You can actually make it.

2689
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Not be.

2690
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
A traversal skill.

2691
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It still has a cooldown.

2692
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,000
But.

2693
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Then you can use.

2694
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Other abilities if you want.

2695
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And there's just.

2696
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,000
There's just.

2697
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,000
A bunch of.

2698
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Interesting stuff here.

2699
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
There's a.

2700
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,000
There's a.

2701
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So.

2702
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The skill design.

2703
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
The base function.

2704
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,000
You have the.

2705
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,000
The first.

2706
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And the second one.

2707
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So.

2708
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You are in the.

2709
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You have the ability.

2710
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
To go back in time.

2711
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So.

2712
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
We can do stuff.

2713
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
In that time period.

2714
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
For example.

2715
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,000
We can just.

2716
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Provide you frenzy.

2717
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
When you are between.

2718
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
The first and the second.

2719
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But.

2720
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,000
If you want to.

2721
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You can just remove.

2722
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
The second combo.

2723
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Altogether.

2724
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So.

2725
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Now you can actually just.

2726
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Have it as a proper.

2727
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Traversal skill.

2728
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
That doesn't go backwards.

2729
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Ever.

2730
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Or.

2731
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And that removes.

2732
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
The possibility of staying.

2733
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
With a frenzy.

2734
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,000
For example.

2735
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yes.

2736
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Because you no longer.

2737
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Have the ability.

2738
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,000
To go backwards.

2739
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So.

2740
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,000
What I.

2741
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
What I like a lot.

2742
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Is.

2743
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You know.

2744
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,000
There's my.

2745
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,000
My little.

2746
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Devouring orbs.

2747
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I put them back.

2748
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
And then.

2749
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,000
We'll just.

2750
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah.

2751
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
There's.

2752
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,000
There's some.

2753
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
There's some cool stuff there.

2754
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
What else?

2755
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,000
We have.

2756
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
We have so many changes here.

2757
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh.

2758
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh yeah.

2759
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Sigils of hope.

2760
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Is no longer sigils.

2761
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It's now.

2762
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Symbols of hope.

2763
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Symbols of hope.

2764
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Some reason.

2765
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah.

2766
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And we completely changed.

2767
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
The base functionality of it.

2768
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So previously.

2769
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
You had basically two.

2770
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Well.

2771
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I guess three ways.

2772
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Since we introduced the unique.

2773
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
But for the vast majority of the time.

2774
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Of the skill was.

2775
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
You cast it.

2776
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
It costs a lot of mana.

2777
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
And you have a duration.

2778
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,000
For the sigil.

2779
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
That gives you some buffs.

2780
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So now.

2781
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,000
They just.

2782
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Automatically generate.

2783
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Over time.

2784
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And then.

2785
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
When you actually use the.

2786
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,000
The button.

2787
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
You get a defensive buff.

2788
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And it consumes them.

2789
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And then you.

2790
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Wait.

2791
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Them to get again.

2792
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,000
So.

2793
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Okay.

2794
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
You see here.

2795
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I have five.

2796
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
It shows five.

2797
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,000
On the icon here.

2798
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Because I used.

2799
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
When I had five.

2800
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
And now they just.

2801
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Come back.

2802
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Ramping up.

2803
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah.

2804
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah.

2805
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Yeah.

2806
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And you can.

2807
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
You can like.

2808
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Influence how fast.

2809
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
They come back.

2810
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I think.

2811
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah.

2812
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Here.

2813
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And there's some other changes.

2814
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
In the skill tree here.

2815
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But the skill tree.

2816
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Like the overlay here.

2817
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Looks pretty much the same.

2818
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
But there's been.

2819
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Some changes.

2820
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Like for example.

2821
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
The divine flare.

2822
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I think you can.

2823
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Kind of maybe.

2824
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Even make it.

2825
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
An actual build now.

2826
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You remove.

2827
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
The defensive part of it.

2828
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But.

2829
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Now you just.

2830
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
You don't have to.

2831
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Generate the sigils anymore.

2832
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
To then use divine flare.

2833
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Now.

2834
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
They are just generated.

2835
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And then you just use divine flare.

2836
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Instead.

2837
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So.

2838
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It also saves you mana like that.

2839
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
A lot.

2840
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Other cool things.

2841
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It's vengeance.

2842
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
The first skill you get.

2843
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I think this cookie has.

2844
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Changed a bit.

2845
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Yeah.

2846
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Okay.

2847
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So.

2848
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You can now.

2849
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Convert it to void.

2850
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Which is.

2851
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Kind of cool.

2852
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Oh.

2853
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
We got a.

2854
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Nice little.

2855
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Scaler here.

2856
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
That gives you.

2857
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Fistpen.

2858
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
With.

2859
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Your extra.

2860
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Overcap.

2861
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Physical resistance.

2862
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And I think if you convert this.

2863
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
This also applies to the other ones.

2864
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So if you convert it to fire.

2865
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It goes to fire.

2866
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
If you convert it to.

2867
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Void.

2868
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I think you have fire.

2869
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Conversion somewhere.

2870
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Yeah.

2871
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
That too.

2872
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You can turn.

2873
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Your.

2874
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Iron blades.

2875
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
That nobody really used before.

2876
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Into.

2877
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Forge weapons now.

2878
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And.

2879
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
The iron blades.

2880
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Can also be.

2881
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Kind of useful.

2882
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
And there's some other stuff.

2883
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Like.

2884
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Buffing your erasing strike here.

2885
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You know.

2886
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
You're smashing your face.

2887
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Against Abby.

2888
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,000
With your vengeance.

2889
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
To get your damage.

2890
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Mitigation from vengeance.

2891
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And then you.

2892
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You know.

2893
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Smack it with erasing strike.

2894
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And do more damage.

2895
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Just.

2896
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Yeah.

2897
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Don't let me stop you.

2898
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Keep going.

2899
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
What else?

2900
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
What else?

2901
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
You can just hover over every node.

2902
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Real quick.

2903
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yeah.

2904
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Okay.

2905
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Okay.

2906
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Okay.

2907
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Okay.

2908
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Okay.

2909
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Here.

2910
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Here's.

2911
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Here's big.

2912
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,000
This is a big one.

2913
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So.

2914
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Previously.

2915
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,000
In the past.

2916
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,000
When you.

2917
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Combined.

2918
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Siege Baras.

2919
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
With Divine Fury.

2920
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,000
The Divine Fury.

2921
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Which is just.

2922
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Adds.

2923
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Like.

2924
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,000
New.

2925
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You know.

2926
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,000
The POE.

2927
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Sorry.

2928
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,000
D2.

2929
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Lightning Fury.

2930
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
When you hit something.

2931
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,000
It just.

2932
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Throws more stuff.

2933
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So.

2934
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Previously.

2935
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,000
These two.

2936
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Did not work together.

2937
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Well.

2938
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,000
That's changed.

2939
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So now.

2940
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Now.

2941
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Now it does work.

2942
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So you can.

2943
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
You can throw a lot of.

2944
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Lightning.

2945
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
With Javelin now.

2946
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
That looks amazing.

2947
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Show me that one more time.

2948
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,000
It looks good.

2949
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Yeah.

2950
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,000
For the people in the back.

2951
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Need to see that again.

2952
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Yeah.

2953
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It's pretty fun.

2954
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It helps a lot.

2955
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It helps a lot.

2956
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It helps a lot.

2957
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It helps a lot.

2958
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Yeah.

2959
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Spear scaling.

2960
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
With Javelin is automatic.

2961
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And as Forge Guard.

2962
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
You can now do.

2963
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Yeah.

2964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Spear with a shield.

2965
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I'm not sure if I want to.

2966
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Open my passive trees.

2967
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,000
For you here.

2968
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yeah.

2969
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Right.

2970
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
That's a mind deal.

2971
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,000
There's.

2972
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Yeah.

2973
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
There's a lot of changes.

2974
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,000
In there.

2975
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
So maybe.

2976
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Maybe we'll save that for future.

2977
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Mulder Strike.

2978
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Like.

2979
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
You can now.

2980
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Oh.

2981
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Shotgun.

2982
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah.

2983
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
You can shotgun now.

2984
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So you have some really good single target.

2985
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,000
With Blade Storm now.

2986
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Which is.

2987
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That's beautiful.

2988
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It turned.

2989
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
It turned the skill into an actually.

2990
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Really good skill now.

2991
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
You're saying it was really bad.

2992
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And now you actually made it good.

2993
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Is that what you're saying?

2994
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It lacked on the.

2995
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Like the single target.

2996
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Like you couldn't invest into making it.

2997
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
A really good for single target.

2998
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Yeah.

2999
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
You could do stuff like.

3000
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Smite proc.

3001
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Stuff like that.

3002
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,000
But now.

3003
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
You can actually make.

3004
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
The skill do you really good damage on its own.

3005
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
What else?

3006
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Any Forge Strike stuff?

3007
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I've got Void.

3008
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I think both.

3009
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Forge Strike and Smelder Sprat.

3010
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Are just.

3011
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Better.

3012
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Basically.

3013
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Better.

3014
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Ring of Shields.

3015
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yeah.

3016
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Ring of Shields.

3017
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
This note that nobody ever took.

3018
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I think you might be able to do something with it.

3019
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Because.

3020
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So.

3021
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Ring of Shields.

3022
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Is.

3023
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Is a minion skill.

3024
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I don't think many people know that.

3025
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But.

3026
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It's a minion skill.

3027
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And.

3028
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
It had this.

3029
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Fire damage for a time here.

3030
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
But nobody will use.

3031
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,000
But.

3032
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It might.

3033
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Work.

3034
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Now.

3035
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
We've done a lot of.

3036
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Like small changes around.

3037
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Judgment.

3038
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Because.

3039
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,000
One of the things with.

3040
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
With Void.

3041
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
The Reverser was that.

3042
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,000
It was providing.

3043
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
A lot of mana.

3044
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
If you build it like that way.

3045
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,000
So.

3046
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
There's like the.

3047
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Judgment.

3048
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Mana dump build.

3049
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
That you had to use.

3050
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
For the reverse to get mana back.

3051
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So.

3052
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,000
We.

3053
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
We kept how much mana.

3054
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You can actually consume.

3055
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Without.

3056
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Without nerfing the damage.

3057
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,000
So.

3058
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It doesn't empty your mana pool.

3059
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Like crazy anymore.

3060
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Which is.

3061
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,000
It's kind of nice.

3062
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
And also it just.

3063
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Does more damage.

3064
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Well.

3065
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
That's a nice new change.

3066
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
A lot of quality life in that.

3067
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah.

3068
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Shield throw.

3069
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
No longer has a cooldown.

3070
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
As a baseline.

3071
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Which is kind of cool.

3072
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It still has it.

3073
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So that you can only throw.

3074
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
A shield at a time.

3075
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
So if your shield is still.

3076
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You know.

3077
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Ping-boing between enemies.

3078
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You can throw another one.

3079
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Well.

3080
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Now with one point.

3081
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
You can also remove that.

3082
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
So you can't just.

3083
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Throw them.

3084
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
As much as you want.

3085
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Previously this node.

3086
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I think regard.

3087
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Going through.

3088
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
A lot of points.

3089
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
To even get there.

3090
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
And if you still want to play it.

3091
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,000
With a cooldown.

3092
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You can do that.

3093
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And do more damage.

3094
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And then.

3095
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
It allows also.

3096
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Now.

3097
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Can chain off you.

3098
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So.

3099
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,000
You can do more.

3100
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Seeing target damage.

3101
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
If you want.

3102
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
And you can.

3103
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Combine it with like.

3104
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You could just.

3105
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Be like a.

3106
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Hybrid.

3107
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Of.

3108
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,000
You know.

3109
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Shield throw.

3110
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And then something else.

3111
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Use it in the cooldown.

3112
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And whatnot.

3113
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And so it's just spamming the one skill.

3114
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
So this is part of like.

3115
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
The throwing.

3116
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Niche.

3117
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,000
That you're like.

3118
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Kind of.

3119
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Setting into the sentinel.

3120
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Yeah.

3121
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
There's a lot of.

3122
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I think shield bash.

3123
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Just does more damage.

3124
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Oh yeah.

3125
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
One thing that people have been asking.

3126
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
For a long time.

3127
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It's.

3128
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Drive.

3129
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
With void conversion.

3130
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You have that now.

3131
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Nice.

3132
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
There's a.

3133
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
There's a lot of.

3134
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Changes.

3135
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Around here.

3136
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So a lot of people.

3137
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Love.

3138
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Spin to win.

3139
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
What are the changes.

3140
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,000
For season two.

3141
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Since we're opening up.

3142
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,000
This can of worms.

3143
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
What's the changes.

3144
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
To warp path.

3145
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,000
If any.

3146
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Uh.

3147
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't think.

3148
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
There's too many changes.

3149
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:56,000
On warbath.

3150
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Specifically.

3151
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Some.

3152
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Some buffs.

3153
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Here and there.

3154
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I think.

3155
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Warbath is already good.

3156
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Yes.

3157
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Especially if you're playing.

3158
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It doesn't avoid nights.

3159
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
With the echoes.

3160
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And.

3161
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
The masteries.

3162
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I mean.

3163
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Just the changes.

3164
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,000
To the passive trees.

3165
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Are making it.

3166
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
A lot better.

3167
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Regardless of how you play.

3168
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Basically.

3169
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And you were not able.

3170
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
To show the skill tree.

3171
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I'm probably already.

3172
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Getting fired.

3173
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
From showing this.

3174
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I'm.

3175
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Maybe I'll not get sued.

3176
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
If I don't show them.

3177
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But yeah.

3178
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
There's a lot of.

3179
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
There's a lot of.

3180
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,000
There's a lot of.

3181
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
There's a lot of.

3182
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Changes in the passive trees.

3183
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And you'll definitely.

3184
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Learn about them.

3185
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
So.

3186
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah.

3187
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Yeah.

3188
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
We're learning right now.

3189
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Like I'm not going to stop you.

3190
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Anything else you want to show us?

3191
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah.

3192
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Hmm.

3193
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Maybe.

3194
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Maybe we just show the heart cheaker.

3195
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Like this too.

3196
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It's way.

3197
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Way cooler.

3198
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Well.

3199
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Okay.

3200
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I.

3201
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
When I do this.

3202
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I need to go.

3203
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Check that I don't actually leak anything there.

3204
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
So I'm going to close my screen now.

3205
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And Mike can talk about heart cheaker.

3206
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,000
While I.

3207
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,000
While I.

3208
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
While I set up my character.

3209
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
No.

3210
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I'm going to hide it from YouTube.

3211
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Yeah.

3212
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Do that as well.

3213
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
In case.

3214
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Are there.

3215
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Oh.

3216
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Let's do it.

3217
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Never mind.

3218
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,000
One second.

3219
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Let me.

3220
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Let me hop onto.

3221
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Onto a marksman real quick.

3222
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,000
There we go.

3223
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You're off screen as well.

3224
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Everything's set.

3225
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Fine.

3226
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I have a lot.

3227
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I have a lot of DMs in my slack.

3228
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I bet.

3229
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Thank you.

3230
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,000
By the way.

3231
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
It is fine.

3232
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You know.

3233
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
One of my follow up questions.

3234
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Was about Sigil of Hope.

3235
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
To get you talking about it.

3236
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
But you covered that already.

3237
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,000
So.

3238
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We're good.

3239
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Oh yeah.

3240
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I have idols.

3241
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Here I am.

3242
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Not showing.

3243
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,000
So.

3244
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Maybe when you're checking that.

3245
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Maybe we can have Mike.

3246
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Elaborate a little bit.

3247
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
On the part you said.

3248
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Carver.

3249
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Where you said that.

3250
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Forge guards is better.

3251
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So I'm guessing my question.

3252
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Would be forge guard.

3253
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And manifest armor.

3254
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Maybe Mike could spill some beans.

3255
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
On what he.

3256
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
What Carver started.

3257
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Meaning.

3258
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
When he said they're better.

3259
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I mean.

3260
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
So a lot of the stuff with.

3261
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Forge guard.

3262
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Mechanically.

3263
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
We were actually pretty happy with.

3264
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Where it's.

3265
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Sitting and feeling.

3266
01:07:59,000 --> 01:07:59,000
And.

3267
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
But because it did lose some.

3268
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Damage numbers from.

3269
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
From volatile reversal.

3270
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
We have buffed up some.

3271
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:06,000
There's some.

3272
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Like.

3273
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Hey this now does.

3274
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
This number is higher.

3275
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,000
This number is bigger.

3276
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
So there's not a lot of like.

3277
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Huge mechanical changes.

3278
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Other than the.

3279
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
One huge passive node.

3280
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That has.

3281
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
A lot of implications.

3282
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Around.

3283
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Around the.

3284
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Basically every ability.

3285
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
That it has.

3286
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
The big thing for forge guard.

3287
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It's the.

3288
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Two-hander.

3289
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And a shield.

3290
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah.

3291
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
It allows you to do some cool things.

3292
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
One thing that.

3293
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
You couldn't take the manifest armor node.

3294
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Where it gave it a sword.

3295
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Like.

3296
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Like a weapon.

3297
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And a shield.

3298
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
That you can only ever use a one-handed weapon.

3299
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,000
With that.

3300
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Now you can use a two-handed weapon.

3301
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You can have your manifest armor clone.

3302
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
A two-handed weapon.

3303
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And a shield.

3304
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
At the same time.

3305
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So like.

3306
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Yeah.

3307
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,000
There's.

3308
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
There's a manifest armor buff.

3309
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Right.

3310
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Just right there.

3311
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,000
From that node.

3312
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So a lot of these like.

3313
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Knock-on effects.

3314
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And things where like.

3315
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,000
If you're.

3316
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
If you're doing.

3317
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Like forged weapons.

3318
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And you're trying to use.

3319
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Like shield scaling stuff.

3320
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,000
At the same time.

3321
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It wasn't really viable.

3322
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Because you wanted to have a two-handed weapon.

3323
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:05,000
For manifest weapon.

3324
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Spawning.

3325
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
So it's.

3326
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,000
There's.

3327
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,000
There's.

3328
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
That node has such huge implications.

3329
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And ripples across all of Forge Guard.

3330
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
That it's.

3331
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Like.

3332
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
There wasn't a lot that needed to change.

3333
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Without having it touch.

3334
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Basically every tree.

3335
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And at the same time.

3336
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
We did bump up some numbers as well.

3337
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,000
That's fair.

3338
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
At least.

3339
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Sorry.

3340
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
At least two uniques.

3341
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
That we made for this patch.

3342
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Had to be.

3343
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Slightly.

3344
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Looked again.

3345
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Because Forge Guard's node exists enough.

3346
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,000
So.

3347
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yeah.

3348
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
So one of the questions.

3349
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I had as a follow-up.

3350
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
For the Forge Guard minion.

3351
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Specifically.

3352
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
With manifested Forge weapons.

3353
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Is that.

3354
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It feels very.

3355
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,000
One-dimensional.

3356
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
On the terms of the aspect.

3357
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Of playing minion builds.

3358
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
With Forge Guard mastery.

3359
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
As a whole.

3360
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So.

3361
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I guess the question I have.

3362
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
If there are any plans.

3363
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Whether they're for patch 1.2.

3364
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Or beyond.

3365
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
That we'll see Forge Guard minion play.

3366
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Properly utilize the minions.

3367
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
In a way that is more comparable.

3368
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,000
To.

3369
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Other masteries.

3370
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
That also uses minions.

3371
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Such as the Acolytes.

3372
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Yeah.

3373
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
So we really want to keep the minion.

3374
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Play.

3375
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
The gameplay feel.

3376
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Of minions.

3377
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
To be unique and distinct.

3378
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,000
From.

3379
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Class to class.

3380
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,000
So like.

3381
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
The obvious.

3382
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
The really easy ones to talk about.

3383
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Is companions versus.

3384
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Like primalist companions.

3385
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Versus necromancer minions.

3386
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah.

3387
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
And there's a really obvious difference.

3388
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
The way we approach those.

3389
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
The companions can be revived.

3390
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
You have far fewer of them.

3391
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
The necromancer minions.

3392
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Are designed to be sacrificed.

3393
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Literally.

3394
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
With the ability to sacrifice.

3395
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And.

3396
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So like.

3397
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
That's really easy.

3398
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
To look at them differently.

3399
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And then the.

3400
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
The Forge.

3401
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Forge Guard minions.

3402
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,000
It's.

3403
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,000
It's in a.

3404
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
It's a tricky thing to.

3405
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:37,000
To.

3406
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Nail down an identity for it.

3407
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And we kind of look at them.

3408
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Almost like an extension.

3409
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Of the character.

3410
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,000
A little bit.

3411
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,000
And.

3412
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Because they're so heavily.

3413
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Tied to your gear.

3414
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And.

3415
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Because they're so heavily.

3416
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Tied to your gear.

3417
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
The one thing people expect from them.

3418
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Is them to actually.

3419
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Mimic the unique effects.

3420
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
That your gear has.

3421
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I think that's the key.

3422
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Missing mechanical piece.

3423
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
For Forge weapons.

3424
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Which they still will not do.

3425
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,000
In season two.

3426
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I'm sorry.

3427
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
But we are looking to.

3428
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Extract some of the essence.

3429
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Out of those.

3430
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Unique items.

3431
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
That you want to capture.

3432
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,000
For.

3433
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
For future.

3434
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Stuff down the road.

3435
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah.

3436
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And just.

3437
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Random note.

3438
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So.

3439
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
There's this.

3440
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
New ring that we added.

3441
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I think it was in.

3442
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:16,000
1.1.

3443
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Maybe.

3444
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,000
The.

3445
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Yeah.

3446
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Phantom grip.

3447
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
That had some.

3448
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Interesting bug on it.

3449
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And.

3450
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Since we fixed that bug.

3451
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
We.

3452
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
We just gave.

3453
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,000
A flat.

3454
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Really big buff.

3455
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Both damage and.

3456
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Defense.

3457
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,000
To Forge weapons.

3458
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
So.

3459
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
If you were.

3460
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,000
One of those people.

3461
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Who were having like.

3462
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Really crazy setup.

3463
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
With the ring.

3464
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
In the bug form.

3465
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You probably got nerfed a bit.

3466
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
But for everyone else.

3467
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Forge weapons are better.

3468
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Like.

3469
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
If you didn't have like.

3470
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Crazy setup.

3471
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Abusing the bug.

3472
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Your Forge weapon.

3473
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Should be better.

3474
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
This match.

3475
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Also.

3476
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I'm ready.

3477
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I'm in.

3478
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Heart Seeker.

3479
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Right now.

3480
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,000
If you.

3481
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Let me know when the stream's up.

3482
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
And I'll put it up.

3483
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Back up.

3484
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,000
It is.

3485
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
It is up.

3486
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Misa again.

3487
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Your full screen.

3488
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,000
And ready to go.

3489
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Yeah.

3490
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So this is a very interesting skill.

3491
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Okay.

3492
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So.

3493
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Skill itself.

3494
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
The base functionality.

3495
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Is as simply as.

3496
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
You shoot an arrow.

3497
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,000
To a target.

3498
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It ignores everything.

3499
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
On its way.

3500
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
To whatever you were aiming.

3501
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And then.

3502
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
It hits that.

3503
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
And then it has a chance.

3504
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
To hit it again.

3505
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
So basically.

3506
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
It goes through it.

3507
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Comes back.

3508
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And hits again.

3509
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
And one of the key.

3510
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Mechanics of this.

3511
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Is to.

3512
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Increase.

3513
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
The recurve chance.

3514
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So you can hit the same target.

3515
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
With one use of the ability.

3516
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Many times.

3517
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,000
So if you guys remember.

3518
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Guided arrow.

3519
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
From D2.

3520
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,000
In its quarry.

3521
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,000
When.

3522
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It was able to pierce.

3523
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And hit the target.

3524
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Multiple times.

3525
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
We basically just did that.

3526
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
And added the skill tree.

3527
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Okay.

3528
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,000
There's a.

3529
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
There's a.

3530
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Very long.

3531
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Interesting discussion.

3532
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And a lot of.

3533
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Design.

3534
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Portions of this.

3535
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
One being.

3536
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,000
How.

3537
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
What is the.

3538
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
How do we do the.

3539
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
The chance to hit the target.

3540
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Multiple times.

3541
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So.

3542
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,000
In D2.

3543
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
You just have a pierce chance.

3544
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Right.

3545
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,000
And.

3546
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Each percentage that you get.

3547
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Is just way better than previous.

3548
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
So if you go from.

3549
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
50% to 75% chance.

3550
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And then you go from 75% to 100% chance.

3551
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
You're just.

3552
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
It's so much more.

3553
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Powerful.

3554
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
So we didn't want to have this.

3555
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Where.

3556
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It's just.

3557
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Every single point.

3558
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
It gets crazy good.

3559
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
For multiple reasons.

3560
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It.

3561
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Makes it harder for us to.

3562
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Provide the chance.

3563
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
In gear and whatnot.

3564
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
You have to be very careful.

3565
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
To not allow you to hit like.

3566
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Over 95% chance.

3567
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
We want.

3568
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
There to be some.

3569
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Volatility.

3570
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,000
So that.

3571
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
It's not always hitting.

3572
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Five times.

3573
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Every single time.

3574
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Or six times.

3575
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Or seven times.

3576
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Or whatever.

3577
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,000
So we didn't.

3578
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We couldn't really go with.

3579
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,000
A.

3580
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You have.

3581
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You know.

3582
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
The first one.

3583
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Every single time.

3584
01:13:59,000 --> 01:13:59,000
You just pierce once.

3585
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And then you.

3586
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Invest into.

3587
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Another appears chance.

3588
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Or stuff like that.

3589
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,000
So.

3590
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
What we ended up being.

3591
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Is.

3592
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Every single time.

3593
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It successfully recurves.

3594
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
The next one.

3595
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
The chance is just.

3596
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Multiplied.

3597
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,000
By.

3598
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:15,000
A number.

3599
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
That keeps going down.

3600
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So if you start with.

3601
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I wonder if we have an example here.

3602
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
So let's say that you have.

3603
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
200% chance.

3604
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
You're guaranteed.

3605
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
On the first.

3606
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
To hit again.

3607
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And then.

3608
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
That 200% chance.

3609
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Gets multiplied by.

3610
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
0.8.

3611
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,000
The ones.

3612
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,000
My.

3613
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I'm not going to do math.

3614
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,000
On stream here.

3615
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Sorry.

3616
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Yeah.

3617
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
So.

3618
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Yeah.

3619
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So you just keep.

3620
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Going down.

3621
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Until.

3622
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Eventually.

3623
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
It's no longer.

3624
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,000
A guaranteed chance.

3625
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And now you run into this.

3626
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Point where.

3627
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
You have this chance to.

3628
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Get like.

3629
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
A really nice chain.

3630
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Of getting multiple hits.

3631
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Or it just fails.

3632
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,000
So there's.

3633
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
That's where the.

3634
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Volatility comes from.

3635
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And then we did.

3636
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
A lot of.

3637
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Cool stuff.

3638
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
On the skill tree.

3639
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
But before I go there.

3640
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Do you have any questions.

3641
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,000
On that?

3642
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:02,000
No.

3643
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I think that.

3644
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
That sounds like.

3645
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,000
A really cool way to.

3646
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Create a volatility.

3647
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Without it feeling bad.

3648
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I like that.

3649
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yeah.

3650
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
We did a lot of math.

3651
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And simulations.

3652
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And.

3653
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Probably.

3654
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Somebody could go.

3655
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Dig it up.

3656
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
From some of our chats.

3657
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,000
But yeah.

3658
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
It was fun.

3659
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Maybe showing action a little bit.

3660
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Once you're.

3661
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Yeah.

3662
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Okay.

3663
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
So.

3664
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I have.

3665
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I have.

3666
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Oh yeah.

3667
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
This is a base skill only.

3668
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
So I don't have much.

3669
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,000
But.

3670
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,000
It's all.

3671
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I have some gear.

3672
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
That keeps me.

3673
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So.

3674
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It's just.

3675
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You know.

3676
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
It goes through the enemy.

3677
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And it goes back.

3678
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And it hits again.

3679
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
That's nice.

3680
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
So.

3681
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
One of the main reasons.

3682
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,000
For this skill.

3683
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Is that.

3684
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
We didn't have like a.

3685
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Like a strong.

3686
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Like a single target.

3687
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Like a physical based skill.

3688
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Like.

3689
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
We have the.

3690
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:50,000
We have the.

3691
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
We have the detonate arrow.

3692
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
You can't convert the physical.

3693
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
So basically.

3694
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
The only physical abilities.

3695
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Are just.

3696
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Flurry.

3697
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Puncture.

3698
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And the multi shot.

3699
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
And you can make multi shot.

3700
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Into a single target ability.

3701
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,000
But.

3702
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's not really.

3703
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,000
A single target ability.

3704
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:03,000
By base.

3705
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
So that's what.

3706
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
The heart seeker.

3707
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Is.

3708
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
By.

3709
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
By it's.

3710
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Like.

3711
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Basic design.

3712
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Doing.

3713
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,000
All right.

3714
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
You can clear with it.

3715
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
For example.

3716
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
If you take this node.

3717
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,000
So.

3718
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
We were talking about the.

3719
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,000
The chances.

3720
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
On how many times.

3721
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
It goes through an enemy.

3722
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:21,000
So we actually.

3723
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Pre-calculate this.

3724
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,000
So.

3725
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
If you kill an enemy.

3726
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And you have this node.

3727
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
For every additional chance.

3728
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
It would hit the enemy.

3729
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
The additional time.

3730
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It would hit the enemy.

3731
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Instead.

3732
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Puncture.

3733
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Comes out.

3734
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
So.

3735
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,000
If you.

3736
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Let's say that you had.

3737
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
You know.

3738
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Ten hits.

3739
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And you just one shot.

3740
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,000
The enemy on the field.

3741
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
First hits.

3742
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
You get ten punctures.

3743
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Just flying around.

3744
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
To other enemies.

3745
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,000
So that's.

3746
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Huh.

3747
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Kind of.

3748
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,000
That.

3749
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,000
That's basically the.

3750
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Only node.

3751
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Inside the skill tree itself.

3752
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:50,000
That builds.

3753
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Like.

3754
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Like AOE.

3755
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Yeah.

3756
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Oh yeah.

3757
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I guess.

3758
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Another thing about the basic functionality.

3759
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
If the target dies.

3760
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
It will just find a new target.

3761
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
To hit.

3762
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:01,000
With the remaining.

3763
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Recurves.

3764
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I think that's really important.

3765
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,000
So.

3766
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
It doesn't just like.

3767
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Vanish.

3768
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
It'll just.

3769
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
It'll seek another one.

3770
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
To damage to.

3771
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Yeah.

3772
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
And there's a screen wide.

3773
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Or.

3774
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,000
You can.

3775
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You can shoot it.

3776
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,000
It's a.

3777
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It's a very large.

3778
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Range of retargeting.

3779
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Yeah.

3780
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
The retargeting is very large.

3781
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Long range.

3782
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Okay.

3783
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,000
It'll just.

3784
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
It'll just keep hitting the same target.

3785
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And then.

3786
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
If it dies.

3787
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I think.

3788
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I think the retargeting.

3789
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It's probably like half a screen or something.

3790
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I don't remember exactly how far.

3791
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,000
But it's.

3792
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
It's pretty far.

3793
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yeah.

3794
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Okay.

3795
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I mean.

3796
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
If you could probably go.

3797
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Find out.

3798
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:35,000
By going into an area.

3799
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
With some normal monsters that die.

3800
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Then I can actually show.

3801
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
This node too.

3802
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But yeah.

3803
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Some other stuff.

3804
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So.

3805
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Obviously we have some.

3806
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Just base.

3807
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,000
You know.

3808
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Recurve chance.

3809
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And then.

3810
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:48,000
This is.

3811
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
We talk about the volatility.

3812
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,000
So.

3813
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
This is a cool node.

3814
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Because this just.

3815
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Sets it.

3816
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
So that it'll never go below.

3817
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
66%.

3818
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
So.

3819
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
This allows it to.

3820
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Potentially.

3821
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Go for some.

3822
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Crazy.

3823
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Amount of hits.

3824
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Yeah.

3825
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:04,000
And then.

3826
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Obviously.

3827
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
We had to put a deck scale over there.

3828
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:07,000
So.

3829
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Stack decks.

3830
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And you get more.

3831
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Recurve chance.

3832
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
We got.

3833
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Cold conversion.

3834
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And we mentioned about the frostbite.

3835
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
So there's.

3836
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Some frostbite supports.

3837
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,000
On.

3838
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Rogue.

3839
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,000
There.

3840
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
You can convert it to fire.

3841
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Obviously.

3842
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
We have.

3843
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Decent amount of.

3844
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Bleed.

3845
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And poison support.

3846
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Like for example.

3847
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Here you can convert your armor shred.

3848
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Into poison chance.

3849
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Kind of reminds.

3850
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I think runemaster.

3851
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Has armor shred.

3852
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
To frostbite chance.

3853
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So.

3854
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:39,000
That there.

3855
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Yeah.

3856
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Obviously we have.

3857
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
The crit hit base stuff here.

3858
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And then you can combine this.

3859
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,000
So you can go.

3860
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Gold crit.

3861
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,000
You can go.

3862
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Fire crit.

3863
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,000
If you wanted to.

3864
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,000
For example.

3865
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,000
You know.

3866
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Like.

3867
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You know.

3868
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Dragon song.

3869
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
With the crits.

3870
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Or you could do.

3871
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Rhino winter.

3872
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:57,000
As you can see.

3873
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
They're proccing there.

3874
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
They're proccing a lot.

3875
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
They're proccing a lot.

3876
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Yeah.

3877
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
They're proccing a lot.

3878
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Yeah.

3879
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You can do some.

3880
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Fun stuff here.

3881
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
You can make it.

3882
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You can make it.

3883
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Into mana generator.

3884
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
The base mana cost.

3885
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I have a bow.

3886
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That's reduced mana cost.

3887
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I'm so excited for this skill.

3888
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Yeah.

3889
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It has a pretty low.

3890
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
It has a pretty low.

3891
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Base mana cost.

3892
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Obviously you can increase it.

3893
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
But with some of the passives.

3894
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,000
The drog has.

3895
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:23,000
But you can.

3896
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Just also turn it into.

3897
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,000
The.

3898
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Mana scaler.

3899
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,000
But yeah.

3900
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,000
There's.

3901
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
There's some cool stuff here.

3902
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
You can also.

3903
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
You can change.

3904
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
How the.

3905
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I should probably put bow back on.

3906
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I think.

3907
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Like the.

3908
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
See how the.

3909
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
The visual pattern.

3910
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Yeah.

3911
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
It changes the visual here.

3912
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Because.

3913
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,000
We.

3914
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
This was another thing.

3915
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,000
We debated a lot.

3916
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Is how should it look like.

3917
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,000
When it.

3918
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,000
You know.

3919
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Recurs back.

3920
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Because.

3921
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
This looks really cool.

3922
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
When it goes like that.

3923
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
But not everyone liked it.

3924
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,000
So.

3925
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
That's why we just put it.

3926
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Into a node instead.

3927
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And it.

3928
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It has a slow chance there.

3929
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So it's.

3930
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Not entirely just.

3931
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:07,000
For the.

3932
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
The theme.

3933
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,000
But.

3934
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Yeah.

3935
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,000
All right.

3936
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I really want to show you this.

3937
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
So let me.

3938
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Let me.

3939
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Yeah.

3940
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Knock yourself out.

3941
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I mean.

3942
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,000
It's fine.

3943
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
You got a couple.

3944
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
A handful of more questions.

3945
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Before we're done.

3946
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:20,000
So just take your time.

3947
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Don't worry about it.

3948
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:23,000
We got time.

3949
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
We got time.

3950
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Yo.

3951
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
We got plenty of time.

3952
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Go for it.

3953
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I'm going to show you there.

3954
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
The page funks right there.

3955
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,000
A little leak.

3956
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I should probably do.

3957
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Specialized puncture too.

3958
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Even.

3959
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I don't need to do that.

3960
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,000
But.

3961
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
So you see some punctures are flying off here.

3962
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Jesus Christ.

3963
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Obviously this is a pretty weak enemy.

3964
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,000
So.

3965
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
But this is a way to build it.

3966
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Oh my god.

3967
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And then.

3968
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
I guess another cool thing.

3969
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:55,000
There's a.

3970
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
There's a.

3971
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Unique weaver.

3972
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
That I don't currently have here.

3973
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,000
That.

3974
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Converts puncture to cold.

3975
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Currently in the game.

3976
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
What it does not do.

3977
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Currently.

3978
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
It doesn't convert the plea chance.

3979
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,000
From.

3980
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
The blood thirst.

3981
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:10,000
The frostbite.

3982
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
But it does.

3983
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
In season two.

3984
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
So you can do.

3985
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
A frostbite puncture.

3986
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Plus.

3987
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Heartseeker.

3988
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Stuff.

3989
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
If you want.

3990
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Feels good.

3991
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So how are you going to make.

3992
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I should try.

3993
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I'll have a conversion here.

3994
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
How are we going to make.

3995
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Other builds compete.

3996
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
With this type of clear speed.

3997
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I'm pretty sure.

3998
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
We are in.

3999
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Like.

4000
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
The lowest.

4001
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Yeah.

4002
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:33,000
So here's.

4003
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Here's the.

4004
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Gold converted one.

4005
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So.

4006
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
When you don't have a target to hit.

4007
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
It's just going to bounce back and forth.

4008
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Where you aimed.

4009
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Yeah.

4010
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Okay.

4011
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Okay.

4012
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
So you could actually stack up.

4013
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
A bunch of arrows.

4014
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Before a boss.

4015
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Because attackable.

4016
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Yeah.

4017
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,000
And then.

4018
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
There's a fire.

4019
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
That is.

4020
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Looks fantastic.

4021
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Yeah.

4022
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
You can also turn this into.

4023
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
A throwing ability.

4024
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
You actually show that.

4025
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
On the trailer.

4026
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It comes from a unique.

4027
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
That I don't currently have.

4028
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
It's a triggered throwing ability.

4029
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
At that point.

4030
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Isn't it?

4031
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Yeah.

4032
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Yeah.

4033
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
So you don't actually.

4034
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Throw it yourself.

4035
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
It just comes from the unique.

4036
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,000
But you have.

4037
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:13,000
You have some.

4038
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Interesting support here.

4039
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
For throwing and spell.

4040
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Builds.

4041
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
For example.

4042
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,000
The.

4043
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,000
You know.

4044
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:19,000
The.

4045
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
The dragon zone.

4046
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
That I was showing earlier.

4047
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,000
And it's interesting.

4048
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Because this scales.

4049
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
With how many times you recurve.

4050
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
So there's a.

4051
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Reason for you to stack.

4052
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
The recurve.

4053
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
As much as you can.

4054
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Because you just want.

4055
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,000
The buff to go.

4056
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
As high as you want.

4057
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Right.

4058
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
And it also keeps throwing.

4059
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:39,000
So.

4060
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
This is where the.

4061
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:41,000
You could.

4062
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Also.

4063
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Use this as a support kill.

4064
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,000
For.

4065
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Some throwing marksman.

4066
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Build.

4067
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Maybe that.

4068
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You know.

4069
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Those exist as well.

4070
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,000
So.

4071
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,000
There's a.

4072
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,000
There's a lot of.

4073
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Cool stuff.

4074
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Cool stuff in Heartseeker.

4075
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I'm.

4076
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
It is important to note.

4077
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
That this is a.

4078
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
A marksman specific ability.

4079
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
You cannot use this.

4080
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
On Falconer or Blade Dancer.

4081
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Yes.

4082
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Yes.

4083
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
This is only for marksman.

4084
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Yep.

4085
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So it's past the chain.

4086
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Basically is what you're saying.

4087
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I think it's a 30.

4088
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
30 point.

4089
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It's 30 points.

4090
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I would.

4091
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I would.

4092
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I would look at the game.

4093
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
But then I would show the skill tree.

4094
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And I'm.

4095
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Yeah.

4096
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I don't know.

4097
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
It's all good.

4098
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I do have a question.

4099
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I don't think there's a lot of changes.

4100
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
For the passives on marksman though.

4101
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:18,000
But yeah.

4102
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
It's.

4103
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,000
It's.

4104
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Locked to marksman.

4105
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Let's not get you sued.

4106
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
We appreciate the showcase.

4107
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I did have a question.

4108
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Regarding.

4109
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Like.

4110
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Extra skills.

4111
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Past the chain.

4112
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Right.

4113
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,000
We.

4114
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
We know there's one lacking for the lich.

4115
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
And.

4116
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
We know there was one missing for the paladin.

4117
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Is that still the case for season two?

4118
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Yes.

4119
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
The only new.

4120
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
The only brand new ability for season two is heart seeker.

4121
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And it's a doozy.

4122
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,000
There's.

4123
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Volatile reversal is essentially a new skill.

4124
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Because it's so heavily reworked.

4125
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
But yeah.

4126
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
The only new one is heart seeker.

4127
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
We are still looking to.

4128
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,000
We.

4129
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I know what the.

4130
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Like we.

4131
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
As a team.

4132
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
We know what the.

4133
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
The.

4134
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I love this build.

4135
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Sorry.

4136
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Getting distracted by card flank.

4137
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
The.

4138
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
We know what the abilities that are going to go in those slots are going to be.

4139
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And.

4140
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
We have started working on some of those.

4141
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
New abilities for future updates.

4142
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
That sounds amazing.

4143
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I mean.

4144
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Right now we have like this electrical theme.

4145
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Going on for the.

4146
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Paladin.

4147
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Specifically.

4148
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Would it be.

4149
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
A far stretch to.

4150
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Seize another type of.

4151
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Minion archetype for that.

4152
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I'd have to ask.

4153
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I'm sorry.

4154
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,000
It's just me.

4155
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I think we're going to be leaning more into the.

4156
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Holy warrior side of the character than the minion side.

4157
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Because we want to keep minions.

4158
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
More a focus on forge guard than on Paladin.

4159
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:40,000
So.

4160
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I think that's unlikely.

4161
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Okay.

4162
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I have to ask.

4163
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
You know he's not made yet.

4164
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Yeah.

4165
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
What happens in development room.

4166
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,000
You know.

4167
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Yeah.

4168
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
You know.

4169
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I got some ideas.

4170
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
You set me up.

4171
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,000
You know.

4172
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I think.

4173
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I think it's time to.

4174
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
For me to close this.

4175
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
To not keep Mike distracted.

4176
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Sorry.

4177
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,000
My bad.

4178
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Yeah.

4179
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000
All good.

4180
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Yeah.

4181
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I'll.

4182
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I'll close.

4183
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Let me get that out.

4184
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Let's do it this way.

4185
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,000
There we go.

4186
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
We're back on track.

4187
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Let me get this.

4188
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
You got some more questions.

4189
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I heard.

4190
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,000
No.

4191
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
That kind of covers.

4192
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
That part.

4193
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
On the topic of minions though.

4194
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I do have a couple of mini questions.

4195
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,000
That lined up.

4196
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
So it's a pretty good segue.

4197
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Into that one.

4198
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Especially after seeing.

4199
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
The heart seeker.

4200
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Having.

4201
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You know.

4202
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Clear speed.

4203
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Is obviously going to be.

4204
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Depending on you know.

4205
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
The difficulty.

4206
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And the damage output.

4207
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You can do of course.

4208
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
But the area coverage.

4209
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Is clearly very very vast.

4210
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And this weaves back.

4211
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Both to the melee question.

4212
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
We talked about earlier.

4213
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,000
But also.

4214
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Specifically melee minions.

4215
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
And the first question.

4216
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I have on the minion parts.

4217
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Is actually minion AI.

4218
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Can feel.

4219
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Or very often feel.

4220
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
A bit frustrating.

4221
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So.

4222
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,000
My question is.

4223
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
If there are any plans.

4224
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
In making them more aggressive.

4225
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
To begin with.

4226
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Yeah.

4227
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So.

4228
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Every minion right now.

4229
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Is its own.

4230
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Entity.

4231
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Its own thing.

4232
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
It thinks for itself.

4233
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
There's no hive mind effect.

4234
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Happening here.

4235
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And I think that in.

4236
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
There's a few ways.

4237
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,000
We can.

4238
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Tackle.

4239
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Making minions more efficient.

4240
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
At.

4241
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Like target acquisition.

4242
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And.

4243
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And all that sort of stuff.

4244
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And it's.

4245
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,000
It's.

4246
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I think there's a few.

4247
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
There's.

4248
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
We don't have a ton of changes.

4249
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:17,000
For season two.

4250
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Coming for this.

4251
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I think there's.

4252
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,000
A few.

4253
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,000
There's a few.

4254
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Few things that are getting added.

4255
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And specifically.

4256
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
As far as like.

4257
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Items.

4258
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
And new balancing things.

4259
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
That can make them stronger.

4260
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
But there's.

4261
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Behavior wise.

4262
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
We don't have any big changes yet.

4263
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,000
For those.

4264
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I do still.

4265
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I really want to do.

4266
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
That minion stances thing.

4267
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
We've talked about a few times.

4268
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
So players can be like.

4269
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I want mine to be more aggressive.

4270
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
We have tried turning up.

4271
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
The aggressiveness of minions.

4272
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
A few times.

4273
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And.

4274
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
It doesn't always work.

4275
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
The way you want it to work.

4276
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Especially with the way.

4277
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,000
With how minions.

4278
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I guess.

4279
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
With the way their AI works.

4280
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
In general.

4281
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
The other option.

4282
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,000
The other approach.

4283
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Is making a hive mind.

4284
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Of some sort.

4285
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Where something was like.

4286
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Okay.

4287
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Well I've got.

4288
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Eight minions.

4289
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And there's.

4290
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Eight targets.

4291
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I'm going to send one minion.

4292
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
To every target.

4293
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Type thing.

4294
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Right now.

4295
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And that.

4296
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
That naturally happens.

4297
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,000
A little bit.

4298
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
If the enemies are spread out.

4299
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,000
But if all the minions.

4300
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Are the same distance.

4301
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Have the same closest target.

4302
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
They'll all focus.

4303
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
That first target.

4304
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Right away.

4305
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,000
And so yeah.

4306
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,000
We.

4307
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
We're really happy.

4308
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,000
With the ability.

4309
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
To target.

4310
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,000
With like.

4311
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
To force targets on.

4312
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,000
With the.

4313
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
With the A key.

4314
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
By default.

4315
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,000
You can be like.

4316
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Okay.

4317
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Attack this target.

4318
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And that does work really well.

4319
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
But we know a lot of people.

4320
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Don't want to.

4321
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Do that.

4322
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Or need to do that.

4323
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And sometimes it's.

4324
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Nicer if they do spread out.

4325
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
And attack multiple targets.

4326
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And that doesn't.

4327
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Allow you to be like.

4328
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Okay.

4329
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Spread out.

4330
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
And attack multiple targets at once.

4331
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Because that's that coverage.

4332
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
That you're talking about.

4333
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
So this is something that we are.

4334
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Looking at still.

4335
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,000
But it's not something we have.

4336
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Big sweeping changes for.

4337
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
In season two.

4338
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Fair enough.

4339
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:46,000
So.

4340
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Yeah.

4341
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Sorry.

4342
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Like.

4343
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I can continue a bit.

4344
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,000
So.

4345
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Yeah.

4346
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I think one thing.

4347
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
There's a couple.

4348
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
A couple of cool things.

4349
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Like.

4350
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Dreadshade now.

4351
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Is permanent.

4352
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So that's going to help.

4353
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Your.

4354
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Your Acolyte.

4355
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Summoners a bit.

4356
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And then.

4357
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
You know how you have.

4358
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Crazy amount of.

4359
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Like.

4360
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Movement speed for some minions.

4361
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And they start.

4362
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Sliding and skating.

4363
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:07,000
You know.

4364
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Yeah.

4365
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
There should be some improvements to that.

4366
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
So they don't just like.

4367
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Slide.

4368
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Right across the enemies.

4369
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
That they were supposed to stop to hit.

4370
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Hopefully.

4371
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:18,000
What else?

4372
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Mana costs.

4373
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
On some of the Acolyte.

4374
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I think.

4375
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Skills are lowered a bit.

4376
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Like for example.

4377
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Walletal zombie.

4378
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
The bear.

4379
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,000
You know.

4380
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
The summon bear.

4381
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:28,000
On primalist.

4382
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
We're reducing the cooldown.

4383
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:31,000
On the swipe.

4384
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
A lot.

4385
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And then we are giving it a.

4386
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Like strength scaler.

4387
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,000
So it just get.

4388
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
The bear just gets.

4389
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Additional melee damage.

4390
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
From strength.

4391
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I think it's like.

4392
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
One per three strength.

4393
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Or something like that.

4394
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:43,000
So.

4395
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,000
You know.

4396
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Strength stacking primalist.

4397
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:46,000
The bear might.

4398
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I'm really excited to see.

4399
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
What someone does with pedal set.

4400
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
In.

4401
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Oh yeah.

4402
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Yeah.

4403
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Yeah.

4404
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Yeah.

4405
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Yeah.

4406
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Let's not.

4407
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Let's leak all the.

4408
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
All the.

4409
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
The set changes here.

4410
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,000
But yeah.

4411
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Bebel sets might be.

4412
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Pretty good there.

4413
01:28:59,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Yeah.

4414
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So there's some set changes.

4415
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
There are some.

4416
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Sabertooth fixes coming too.

4417
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:05,000
They.

4418
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
They.

4419
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Now swipe every time they leap.

4420
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Not just when they use their own ability to leap.

4421
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
They.

4422
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Um.

4423
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
There was some.

4424
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,000
We.

4425
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Sabertooth.

4426
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Sabertooth.

4427
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
That was fixed.

4428
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And then we gave it a couple new nodes.

4429
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I think.

4430
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yeah.

4431
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
So it's actually pretty good now.

4432
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I think.

4433
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yeah.

4434
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Okay.

4435
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So.

4436
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I was still doing the rounds.

4437
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
As I explained earlier.

4438
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Talking to some.

4439
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Uh.

4440
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Creators that mainly make.

4441
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Carnival last Epoch.

4442
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And.

4443
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Obviously.

4444
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
I have some mini questions.

4445
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Which I kind of baked in.

4446
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
But one question that.

4447
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Myself was very interested in hearing.

4448
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Was also coming from.

4449
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Actually RPG Aaron.

4450
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
As well as dreadful.

4451
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
And it's a two question part.

4452
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
So I'm going to start with one of them.

4453
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,000
And that is.

4454
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,000
The.

4455
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Weaving back to melee issue.

4456
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
And that is that they feel lackluster.

4457
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
For both.

4458
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
For melee minions as well.

4459
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:44,000
That they feel lackluster.

4460
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
In terms of clearing.

4461
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Compared to range.

4462
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Because of area coverage.

4463
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And.

4464
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,000
So.

4465
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I guess one of the big questions there.

4466
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Is there going to be improvements.

4467
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
On melee minions.

4468
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
To allow them to hit a wider.

4469
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Uh.

4470
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Target.

4471
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
With their attacks.

4472
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Like.

4473
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Basically.

4474
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Will they have bigger AOEs.

4475
01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Is what I'm asking.

4476
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
I don't think we have any.

4477
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Specific changes to that.

4478
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Uh.

4479
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I think that.

4480
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
The bigger problem for melee minions.

4481
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Would be just.

4482
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Like.

4483
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
How easily can they.

4484
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Like.

4485
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Engage with the new pack of enemies.

4486
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Like.

4487
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
They don't have the run there.

4488
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:14,000
So maybe.

4489
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Giving them some dashes.

4490
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,000
On stuff like that.

4491
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Is going to help a lot.

4492
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:19,000
But like.

4493
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I don't think.

4494
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I don't think there's an.

4495
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Almost like.

4496
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Any skill in the entire game.

4497
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Like a melee skill.

4498
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:26,000
That is just like.

4499
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
An actual single target.

4500
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
They all.

4501
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:29,000
All have like.

4502
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
A small AOE.

4503
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
So.

4504
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,000
As long as the enemies.

4505
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Are close to.

4506
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Each other.

4507
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
It does help.

4508
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:36,000
There are.

4509
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
There are the little changes.

4510
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:37,000
That we mentioned.

4511
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Just a second ago.

4512
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,000
With.

4513
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Um.

4514
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Bear getting swipe.

4515
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And Sabretooth.

4516
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Getting.

4517
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Uh.

4518
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Better.

4519
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:42,000
The fury.

4520
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Fury swipes.

4521
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Happening more often.

4522
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Uh.

4523
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
With its leap engagement.

4524
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,000
And so yeah.

4525
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
There are some little things.

4526
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,000
But there's not.

4527
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Like a.

4528
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
A huge systematic change.

4529
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:52,000
To like.

4530
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,000
All melee minions.

4531
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Getting more AOE.

4532
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Or something like that.

4533
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Yeah.

4534
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
We also just have.

4535
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Yeah.

4536
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Like Meg said.

4537
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,000
All the minions.

4538
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Like.

4539
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
They are their own thing.

4540
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Uh.

4541
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
And we have a lot of them.

4542
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Um.

4543
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
We'll.

4544
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Every now and then.

4545
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,000
We'll.

4546
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
We'll find things to buff.

4547
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,000
So yeah.

4548
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Let us know.

4549
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
What needs to be buffed.

4550
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And we'll buff them.

4551
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
In the future.

4552
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Uh.

4553
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
So yeah.

4554
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I got you.

4555
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Um.

4556
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Another part of this question.

4557
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,000
There is.

4558
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I was talking to these creators.

4559
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,000
As well.

4560
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Which I'm curious about.

4561
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
As well.

4562
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Is.

4563
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Build diversity.

4564
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
When it comes to minions.

4565
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Now we have the unique play style.

4566
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Of Forged Guards.

4567
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
With their type of specific minions.

4568
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
When we.

4569
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:25,000
If you look at the Acolyte.

4570
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:26,000
For example.

4571
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Due to the strength.

4572
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Scaling and power.

4573
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Of the double shade play.

4574
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Infernal and dread shade.

4575
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
We're now getting permanent dread shade.

4576
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
That sounds fantastic.

4577
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
But due to the power scaling.

4578
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Those.

4579
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
It's been very often.

4580
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,000
More favorable.

4581
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
To put them all.

4582
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Stacking all the power.

4583
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Onto one minion.

4584
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Like an archmage.

4585
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Or an abomination.

4586
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
More so.

4587
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Than actually having.

4588
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
An actual army.

4589
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Uh.

4590
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Playing for you.

4591
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
In terms of actual performance.

4592
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
So I guess the question.

4593
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
For season two.

4594
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Or beyond.

4595
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Are there any intentions.

4596
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
In addressing the diversity problem.

4597
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Of actual in-game performance.

4598
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Of minion builds.

4599
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:57,000
With that in mind.

4600
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I remember at least.

4601
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
A couple minion builds.

4602
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
That were army builds.

4603
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
And they were absolutely crazy.

4604
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And we had to nerf them multiple times.

4605
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Because they were so crazy.

4606
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So it's a.

4607
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:09,000
It's a.

4608
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It's a.

4609
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
It's a very fine line.

4610
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
That needs to walk.

4611
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Especially for something like.

4612
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:15,000
You have a minion.

4613
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
That does everything for you.

4614
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
And you just run around.

4615
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
And they do everything for you.

4616
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
So yeah.

4617
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,000
It's a.

4618
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
It is.

4619
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
We don't have any.

4620
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
It's like.

4621
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
We are not targeting specifically.

4622
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
So that.

4623
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Single minion builds.

4624
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Are better than the others.

4625
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It just.

4626
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,000
When people.

4627
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Minimax.

4628
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Complicated game.

4629
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Something.

4630
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Is always better.

4631
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And sometimes.

4632
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It's.

4633
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Single minion builds.

4634
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
It hasn't always been the case.

4635
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Yeah.

4636
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
It hasn't always been the case.

4637
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
So I would expect.

4638
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That eventually.

4639
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
There will.

4640
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Be a.

4641
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Minion army build.

4642
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:49,000
That's going to be.

4643
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Crazy good again.

4644
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
And then we have to nerf it.

4645
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
So yeah.

4646
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
And this is not.

4647
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
What we're seeing in season two.

4648
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
That might be something.

4649
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
We'll talk about.

4650
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,000
In the season two.

4651
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Yeah.

4652
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I don't think we have.

4653
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Balance changes.

4654
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
And itemization.

4655
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
The changes might.

4656
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Make.

4657
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,000
That the thing.

4658
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I don't know.

4659
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:05,000
We'll see.

4660
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Okay.

4661
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I don't have.

4662
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Any crazy changes.

4663
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,000
To minions.

4664
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Specifically targeting.

4665
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Minion army builds.

4666
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:13,000
To be better.

4667
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Okay.

4668
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,000
To be the answer.

4669
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Yeah.

4670
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I do have one last.

4671
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Mini question.

4672
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I don't want to take the interview off.

4673
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
With too many mini questions.

4674
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I know it's me.

4675
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I have to ask some of them.

4676
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
The last mini questions.

4677
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I have specific.

4678
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Specific for minions.

4679
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:24,000
At least.

4680
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Is golem specifically.

4681
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
It feels more like.

4682
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
A consistent.

4683
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Utility option.

4684
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
For minions builds.

4685
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Rather than having.

4686
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
A performing option.

4687
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
As an actual.

4688
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Offensive addition.

4689
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:35,000
To a minion build.

4690
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I believe this is from.

4691
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Frozen Sentinel actually.

4692
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And that said.

4693
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Will we see.

4694
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Some specific changes.

4695
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
To minions in general.

4696
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
For the season.

4697
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Which you already covered.

4698
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,000
But in this case.

4699
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
We're talking about the golem.

4700
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
One of the best references.

4701
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I have for this.

4702
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Is the pyre node.

4703
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
That the golem has.

4704
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Which consumes minions.

4705
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
To do fire damage.

4706
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Like it charges up.

4707
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
It's taking all of these minions.

4708
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
And consuming them.

4709
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Only to.

4710
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Light the little tiny match.

4711
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
And hope that does damage.

4712
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
What's up with that?

4713
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
That specific node.

4714
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I don't think there's any changes coming.

4715
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Okay.

4716
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,000
But yeah.

4717
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
These are just.

4718
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Where.

4719
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
We have.

4720
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
We have so many nodes.

4721
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
In so many skills.

4722
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
That some just.

4723
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Some may need more love.

4724
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
That's it.

4725
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,000
We just.

4726
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
We just need to get the.

4727
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
The feedback.

4728
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
And we need a couple more.

4729
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:21,000
You know.

4730
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Devs to just.

4731
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Just hire some devs.

4732
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
For us to fix skills.

4733
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
And buff them.

4734
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,000
You know.

4735
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
You just need a.

4736
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
It's a.

4737
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
It takes a lot of time.

4738
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Because we could just.

4739
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
You could just make number go big.

4740
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
And then things die.

4741
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Right.

4742
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,000
That.

4743
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
You could make a.

4744
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Vengeance literally one shot.

4745
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
To the entire game.

4746
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
With a single thing.

4747
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
But.

4748
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
We generally.

4749
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Want to be a bit more.

4750
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Involved.

4751
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
With the.

4752
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,000
The buffs and changes.

4753
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:47,000
So that.

4754
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
It isn't just.

4755
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
A number go big.

4756
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Kind of thing.

4757
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Of course.

4758
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I like that approach.

4759
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And I think that you.

4760
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Especially seeing the heart seeker.

4761
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,000
It seems like that's really.

4762
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
The theme of it.

4763
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:57,000
To have more.

4764
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Interesting mechanics.

4765
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And options to play with.

4766
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
So it's not just.

4767
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,000
You know.

4768
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Big number go up.

4769
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Right.

4770
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
I think that's a really good approach.

4771
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Stepping aside.

4772
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Away from minions.

4773
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
For the most part.

4774
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Not entirely.

4775
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
In the trailer.

4776
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
There was images.

4777
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Showing.

4778
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:11,000
One of them showed.

4779
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
A lot of new unique items.

4780
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And it was really cool.

4781
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
But it was one in particular.

4782
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
That stood out for myself.

4783
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And a lot of people in my chat.

4784
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And we talked about this.

4785
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
And it is.

4786
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Nest of nightmares.

4787
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Now we don't get to see much of it.

4788
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
But what we see in the teaser.

4789
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Is a line of text saying.

4790
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Applying spiders.

4791
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
On melee hits.

4792
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Now there's a wording in the game.

4793
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
That says summon this.

4794
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Summon that.

4795
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Like the bee gloves.

4796
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:33,000
And stuff like that.

4797
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
So we've already come to the conclusion.

4798
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
This is not a minion stuff.

4799
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
But we really want to know.

4800
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
What is applying spiders.

4801
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
On melee hits.

4802
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Could you elaborate on this?

4803
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Yes.

4804
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I can tell you exactly.

4805
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
What the ailment spiders does.

4806
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Spiders is a new ailment.

4807
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Okay.

4808
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
It lasts four seconds.

4809
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
And can stack up to four times.

4810
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
It gives the afflicted actor.

4811
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Five percent flat added chance.

4812
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,000
To be critically hit.

4813
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Per stack.

4814
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
So it is.

4815
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Five.

4816
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Ten.

4817
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Fifteen.

4818
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Twenty percent chance.

4819
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Added to be crit.

4820
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:07,000
So basically.

4821
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
If you've got four stacks.

4822
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Of spiders on something.

4823
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:10,000
You only need to hit.

4824
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Eighty percent crit.

4825
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
To always crit.

4826
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Does this stack.

4827
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
With acid skin?

4828
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
This is just.

4829
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Its own.

4830
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Added 20.

4831
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
On top of whatever else.

4832
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:20,000
They might have.

4833
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Yeah.

4834
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Oh shit.

4835
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Okay.

4836
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Yeah.

4837
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I like.

4838
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I like the sound of this.

4839
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
That's good.

4840
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
And because it's applied to the target.

4841
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
It does affect.

4842
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Other people hitting it as well.

4843
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:29,000
So like.

4844
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
If you're.

4845
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
If your minions hit it.

4846
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
They get that as well.

4847
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
If other people in your party hit it.

4848
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
They get that as well.

4849
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
So it's everything hitting the target.

4850
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
All right.

4851
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Another question we have is.

4852
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Idol crafting.

4853
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
We talked about idols before.

4854
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
You're removing the.

4855
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Was it the flat HP.

4856
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
From the stout idols?

4857
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Yeah.

4858
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Yeah.

4859
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Yeah.

4860
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
That's only on stout.

4861
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Does this include the big idols?

4862
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Yeah.

4863
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,000
So the big idols.

4864
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:53,000
That can have double life.

4865
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I think there's only one big idol.

4866
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
That can have double life.

4867
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
And that's on.

4868
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Acolyte.

4869
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I think.

4870
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
It might be.

4871
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
There's a lot more pressure.

4872
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
You won't want it.

4873
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Yeah.

4874
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Yeah.

4875
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Yeah.

4876
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I think it's one of the three.

4877
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I think that might.

4878
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Might still exist.

4879
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Okay.

4880
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So the season two is introducing.

4881
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Weaver's touch.

4882
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Craftable idols.

4883
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
With four modifiers.

4884
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Rather than two.

4885
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
So I guess the question here.

4886
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Is if you could share some information.

4887
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
What type of modifiers.

4888
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
We can expect in the side and slots.

4889
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Or are we going to sit.

4890
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And expect us to go for.

4891
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Trying to weavers.

4892
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Touch our way into double life.

4893
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And armor.

4894
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And arrest roll.

4895
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Or is there any.

4896
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Just more offensive scaling.

4897
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Could you elaborate more.

4898
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
On the modifiers.

4899
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
We will see on these.

4900
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Yeah.

4901
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I don't think we can go.

4902
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I don't think we can do specific.

4903
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I don't think.

4904
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I don't have a list of specific ones here.

4905
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,000
But yeah.

4906
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,000
There'll be.

4907
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
There'll be more interesting things.

4908
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Rather than just like flat stats.

4909
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Quite so much.

4910
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
So you'll start to see.

4911
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Don't.

4912
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I don't want to.

4913
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I don't know if I'm allowed to say.

4914
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Specific ones or not.

4915
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,000
That's why I took.

4916
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
That's why I took them out.

4917
01:37:59,000 --> 01:37:59,000
From my inventory.

4918
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
When I was looking at.

4919
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I mean.

4920
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Are we talking more offensive.

4921
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Mechanically changing modifiers.

4922
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Or are we.

4923
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Are they also including.

4924
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Like baseline stats.

4925
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Such as life resistance armor.

4926
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Stuff like that.

4927
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I guess that's a better question.

4928
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
It's a mixture of both.

4929
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
For sure.

4930
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
The ones that do call out.

4931
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Specific skills.

4932
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Are.

4933
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
I don't think they ever call out.

4934
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Like offensive clearing skills.

4935
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:21,000
As.

4936
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Specific ones.

4937
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So it's.

4938
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It's like there's.

4939
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,000
There's.

4940
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
If it does ever.

4941
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,000
If a.

4942
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Idle.

4943
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Enchantment.

4944
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Does ever call out.

4945
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,000
A specific skill.

4946
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I think it only ever calls out.

4947
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Defensive skills.

4948
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Or utility skills.

4949
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
And.

4950
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Then they can call out.

4951
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Specific.

4952
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Classes.

4953
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Like.

4954
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
One of those.

4955
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Like something for fire skills.

4956
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
You know.

4957
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Things like that.

4958
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
So the categories of.

4959
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Abilities that it'll do sometimes.

4960
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I think the.

4961
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Important takeaway.

4962
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
About.

4963
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Idols.

4964
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Things.

4965
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Is that.

4966
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
There's new power.

4967
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
In idols.

4968
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
That did not exist there before.

4969
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I think that's.

4970
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Hence the curiosity.

4971
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
That said though.

4972
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
When you said that the.

4973
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Flat life and stat idols.

4974
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Were removed.

4975
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
The follow-up question.

4976
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Are.

4977
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Is it.

4978
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Are there any improvements.

4979
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Coming to the baseline idols.

4980
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
That exists in the game.

4981
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Now that we are not.

4982
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Going to see double life.

4983
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Stout idols.

4984
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
So there are any other changes.

4985
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Happening to the baseline idols.

4986
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Besides that.

4987
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:17,000
There.

4988
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
There is.

4989
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
New power in idols.

4990
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
That you haven't seen before.

4991
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Okay.

4992
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
That's it.

4993
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Yeah.

4994
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:23,000
So that's not just.

4995
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
The weaver's touch.

4996
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
That's how I understood it.

4997
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
So this is baseline.

4998
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
All of them gets new added.

4999
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Modifiers that can roll.

5000
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Specifically the.

5001
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Size one and two.

5002
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Idols.

5003
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
There's.

5004
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
There's a bunch of new ones for that.

5005
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Okay.

5006
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Okay.

5007
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Perfect.

5008
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Next question we have.

5009
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Is champion modifiers.

5010
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Coming to the game.

5011
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
And we have.

5012
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Zero information.

5013
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Of what type of modifiers.

5014
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,000
They can be.

5015
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Can we get some.

5016
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Knowledge on this.

5017
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Are you sure it's zero.

5018
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I'm pretty sure.

5019
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I saw some of the trailer.

5020
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I think.

5021
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I think.

5022
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Yeah.

5023
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
It's very minimal.

5024
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
It's borderlining.

5025
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Zero.

5026
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Then.

5027
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Those ones are.

5028
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Those ones are generally more specific.

5029
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
For.

5030
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
They'll call out.

5031
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Individual abilities.

5032
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Really.

5033
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Frequently.

5034
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
So those ones are.

5035
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
They're frequently more specific.

5036
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,000
And.

5037
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Narrow.

5038
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,000
And niche.

5039
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Things.

5040
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
That you're going to be getting out of those.

5041
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
So those.

5042
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Those are.

5043
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Those are designed to be more specific.

5044
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Yeah.

5045
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,000
I think that.

5046
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
The important bit here.

5047
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Is that.

5048
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
They are always sealed.

5049
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Which means.

5050
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
You cannot put.

5051
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Any of the champion affiches.

5052
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Into legendaries.

5053
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
That's the.

5054
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:26,000
You can make.

5055
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
You can make.

5056
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Set items.

5057
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,000
With them.

5058
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Because you can just.

5059
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Craft.

5060
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Craft.

5061
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
The set.

5062
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Affix in there.

5063
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
But you cannot.

5064
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Make.

5065
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:35,000
A.

5066
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Champion.

5067
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Affix.

5068
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Into.

5069
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,000
A.

5070
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Legendary.

5071
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
So a lot of people.

5072
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Have been having.

5073
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
A different takes on this.

5074
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,000
With it.

5075
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
With which modifier.

5076
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Were sealed.

5077
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Champion modifiers.

5078
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Are sealed.

5079
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So they cannot go on unique.

5080
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Games.

5081
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Set item.

5082
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Craft.

5083
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Chards.

5084
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Can become.

5085
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
An actual.

5086
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Prefix.

5087
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Suffix.

5088
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Modifier.

5089
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:52,000
On the item.

5090
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
And affix.

5091
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
But so the set item.

5092
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Can be put on a unique.

5093
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Because my understanding.

5094
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Was that was not possible.

5095
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Okay.

5096
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Those are also not going to be able to put there.

5097
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Okay.

5098
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
When a set shard.

5099
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Gets applied to an item.

5100
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
That item.

5101
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Becomes effectively.

5102
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:06,000
A set item.

5103
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Okay.

5104
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
And set items.

5105
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Cannot be combined.

5106
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
With unique items.

5107
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
To make a legendary.

5108
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Good.

5109
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Then we got that cleared.

5110
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
For everyone.

5111
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Because so many people.

5112
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Have had different takes on this.

5113
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And I'm like.

5114
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Mike said.

5115
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
It's not possible.

5116
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
But what about the sealed.

5117
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Affix.

5118
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I'm pretty sure.

5119
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
That was champion modifiers.

5120
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Let's just get that out of the way.

5121
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
So we have that clear state.

5122
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
That clearly stated.

5123
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Here in the interview.

5124
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Perfect.

5125
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
We are running.

5126
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Really tight on time.

5127
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Right now.

5128
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,000
But.

5129
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
One last question.

5130
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Before.

5131
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I'm going to jump into some Q&A.

5132
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
You can tag Mike.

5133
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Sorry.

5134
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Not Mike.

5135
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
But Wick.

5136
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Or Photon in the chat here.

5137
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
If you have any questions.

5138
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
He'll pick them out.

5139
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
He's already spammed me up.

5140
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:39,000
On Discord.

5141
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
With some questions.

5142
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
But before the Q&A.

5143
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
We have a question.

5144
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
From yet another.

5145
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Last Epoch creator.

5146
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
His name is Frozen Sentinel.

5147
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I call him the spreadsheet god.

5148
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:47,000
At this point.

5149
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And his question was.

5150
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
With more items.

5151
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And item types.

5152
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Being introduced.

5153
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
How is balance approach.

5154
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Coming.

5155
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Being approached.

5156
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
When it comes to.

5157
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Merchant guild.

5158
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Versus.

5159
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Circle of Fortune.

5160
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Well.

5161
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Specifically.

5162
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
It's talking about like.

5163
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,000
So this is like.

5164
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
An additional layer.

5165
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
To the.

5166
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Itemization hunt.

5167
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
So.

5168
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I think most of the.

5169
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Weaver.

5170
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Weaver tree stuff.

5171
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Should work.

5172
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:16,000
With.

5173
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Circle of Fortune.

5174
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
So that you'd still have.

5175
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
That's.

5176
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Extra multiplier there.

5177
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
So it's not.

5178
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Suddenly that everyone plays MG.

5179
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Because there's no reason to play.

5180
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
CoF anymore.

5181
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
And there's some stuff.

5182
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
In the weaver tree.

5183
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
That we'll get into.

5184
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Another time.

5185
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
That you can.

5186
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Influence.

5187
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
The item types.

5188
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:36,000
You're getting.

5189
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
A little bit better.

5190
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And.

5191
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
The cof.

5192
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Does scale off of that.

5193
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:41,000
As well.

5194
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So they play off each other.

5195
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,000
And.

5196
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
It gets amplified.

5197
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
As a cof player.

5198
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Okay.

5199
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:47,000
So we know.

5200
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
We have some new.

5201
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Glyphs.

5202
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And runes.

5203
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,000
For example.

5204
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
The whole.

5205
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Shifting the.

5206
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
The modifier tiers.

5207
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:53,000
On the.

5208
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Sorry.

5209
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
The tiers on the modifiers.

5210
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Can shift.

5211
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Right.

5212
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Is this something.

5213
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:57,000
We'll see.

5214
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Not constellations.

5215
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
But prophecies for.

5216
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
In Circle of Fortune.

5217
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Is that something.

5218
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
We can expect to see.

5219
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Moving forward in season two.

5220
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
For getting the new runes.

5221
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:06,000
The new crafting materials.

5222
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
One of the new runes.

5223
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Will it be.

5224
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Will it have a prophecy.

5225
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Yes.

5226
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:13,000
But.

5227
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
CMF.

5228
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I'm sorry.

5229
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
My head's inside.

5230
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
But merchant skill doesn't.

5231
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
You can't trade.

5232
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,000
You can't.

5233
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Buy and sell those things.

5234
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
On merchant skill anyways.

5235
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:25,000
But yeah.

5236
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Cof does get a little bit.

5237
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Of a boost.

5238
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Of one of them.

5239
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:29,000
It's getting back.

5240
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Now I can hear you.

5241
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I didn't hear shit there.

5242
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Can you say that.

5243
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:33,000
One more time.

5244
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
You chat here.

5245
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Because that's all that matters.

5246
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I think so.

5247
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Did I miss it.

5248
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I think I missed it all.

5249
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:41,000
They're saying.

5250
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Poggers.

5251
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Watch it later.

5252
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Yeah.

5253
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
You were asking about.

5254
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:44,000
You were asking about.

5255
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
The prophecies.

5256
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So.

5257
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
One of the three new runes.

5258
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Will have a prophecy.

5259
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Yeah.

5260
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:51,000
I think through no weaving.

5261
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
But the rest.

5262
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Will.

5263
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:55,000
The CMF.

5264
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Beliars.

5265
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Will get more of those.

5266
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Through just.

5267
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
The CMF perks.

5268
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
And the other prophecies.

5269
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Like.

5270
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
If you have a rune prophecy.

5271
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
That could potentially.

5272
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Give you the other new runes.

5273
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,000
But there isn't.

5274
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
A specific.

5275
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Targeted.

5276
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Prophecy.

5277
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:09,000
For.

5278
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Havoc.

5279
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Or redemption.

5280
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:12,000
All right.

5281
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Since we're running.

5282
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
A little low in time.

5283
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I'm just going to dive.

5284
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Straight into the Q&A.

5285
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Again.

5286
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
You can type.

5287
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
At.

5288
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:19,000
EHG.

5289
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Underscore.

5290
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Wick.

5291
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Or underscore.

5292
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Photon.

5293
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:22,000
For any questions.

5294
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
He's picking them out.

5295
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
So I'm just going to go from the list.

5296
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
He sent me here.

5297
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
He's been picking the questions out.

5298
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
And the first one is.

5299
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
How do you plan to handle.

5300
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Patches.

5301
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Slash.

5302
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Bug fixes.

5303
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
With the new cycle.

5304
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Season.

5305
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
In the new season.

5306
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Yeah.

5307
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Like.

5308
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I don't understand.

5309
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Like.

5310
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Handle them.

5311
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:43,000
We're rolling out.

5312
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
As soon as we can.

5313
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Hot fixes.

5314
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Yeah.

5315
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Yep.

5316
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Hot fixes.

5317
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Yeah.

5318
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Is.

5319
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I'm sorry.

5320
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Yes.

5321
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Yeah.

5322
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Oh.

5323
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,000
It's Q&A.

5324
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
We'll do some rapid fire with them.

5325
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Push about fast and furious.

5326
01:44:59,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Yes.

5327
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
For family.

5328
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
So the next one is about family.

5329
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:02,000
It's with minions.

5330
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Falling further and further behind.

5331
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
In the overall state of balance.

5332
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Is their plan.

5333
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Change.

5334
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
The upcoming release.

5335
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
To help those archetypes out.

5336
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Yeah.

5337
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
There's so much being shaken up.

5338
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
By.

5339
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Item changes.

5340
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Coming this.

5341
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,000
This season.

5342
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
That it's going to be.

5343
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I wouldn't bring any.

5344
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Preconceived notions like that.

5345
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Into the new season.

5346
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
All right.

5347
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Are the time rot nodes.

5348
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Additive.

5349
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Or multiplicative.

5350
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
With each other.

5351
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
They are all three.

5352
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Different multipliers.

5353
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
If talking about the rot creep.

5354
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Yes.

5355
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But within itself.

5356
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Right.

5357
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,000
With itself.

5358
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Yeah.

5359
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
They're all multiplicative.

5360
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
With each other.

5361
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
The time rot chance.

5362
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Is its own.

5363
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Like a bucket.

5364
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Of a multiplier.

5365
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And then the.

5366
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
The other two are also.

5367
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
So you get three different multipliers there.

5368
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
All right.

5369
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Will arena prophecies.

5370
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Still appear.

5371
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
If you have removed arenas.

5372
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
With the new weaver tree node.

5373
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I don't know.

5374
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
The answer is yes.

5375
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I think so.

5376
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Yeah.

5377
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
But you can.

5378
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
You can just.

5379
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
To lock arena prophecies.

5380
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I think there's a new.

5381
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I think there's a new lens.

5382
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Coming in.

5383
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
In season two.

5384
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
That should.

5385
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Make your life.

5386
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
A bit easier.

5387
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Okay.

5388
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Next one is.

5389
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I feel like.

5390
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
For ARPGs.

5391
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
The history is better told.

5392
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Through end of chapter.

5393
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Cut scenes.

5394
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Any plans.

5395
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:25,000
On expanding.

5396
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,000
That front.

5397
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I know.

5398
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I know we've talked about.

5399
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Having better cut scenes.

5400
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:32,000
In the game.

5401
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
And that's something.

5402
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
That people have been.

5403
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Pushing for a lot.

5404
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Me amongst them.

5405
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
For sure.

5406
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I think that those are.

5407
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Improved cut scenes.

5408
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Yeah.

5409
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Storytelling.

5410
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:44,000
It's a huge way.

5411
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:45,000
We've been talking about this.

5412
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:45,000
For years.

5413
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:46,000
About how.

5414
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Like.

5415
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
You can.

5416
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
You can get the story.

5417
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:50,000
From like Diablo 2.

5418
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,000
By just watching the cut scenes.

5419
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:52,000
For the most part.

5420
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,000
And there's not that many.

5421
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Cut scenes there.

5422
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:56,000
And.

5423
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,000
You know.

5424
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Like.

5425
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I think.

5426
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I think adding in those.

5427
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Would be.

5428
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Really hugely beneficial.

5429
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
We don't have any major ones.

5430
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Expansion.

5431
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Because there are.

5432
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
There are.

5433
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,000
There are those.

5434
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Little cut scenes.

5435
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,000
We do have for them.

5436
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Which are great.

5437
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:10,000
But yeah.

5438
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Getting more.

5439
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I'd love to have more.

5440
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
And as we add more chapters.

5441
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,000
All right.

5442
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
So here's another question.

5443
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Which is from Mike.

5444
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,000
It's a bit personal.

5445
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I was very curious about this.

5446
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I even wrote to Fulton about this.

5447
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Saying.

5448
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
What happened to Mike?

5449
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Like.

5450
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Is this good?

5451
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Or is it bad?

5452
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I don't know what is happening.

5453
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
And the question is.

5454
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
When are you releasing the workout routine.

5455
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And diet plan.

5456
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
You look amazing.

5457
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
You've lost a lot of weight.

5458
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,000
You look fantastic.

5459
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And I was like.

5460
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
What is happening?

5461
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I don't even know how to answer it.

5462
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Or ask it.

5463
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
But here's the question.

5464
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Yeah.

5465
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Thank you very much.

5466
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
It is all good.

5467
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:42,000
It is.

5468
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Yeah.

5469
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
It is a lot of hard work.

5470
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And.

5471
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Eating less.

5472
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
And working more.

5473
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Eating less.

5474
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Working out more.

5475
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
It is.

5476
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Yeah.

5477
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
There's.

5478
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
There's no secret to it.

5479
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
You've.

5480
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:56,000
You gotta.

5481
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Calculate how many calories you need to maintain your body weight.

5482
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
And eat less than that.

5483
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
And track them rigorously.

5484
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
And that's literally all I did.

5485
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
All right.

5486
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
It's definitely fair enough.

5487
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Thank you.

5488
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Yeah.

5489
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Feels good.

5490
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Just got in.

5491
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Just got the home gym set up.

5492
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Nice.

5493
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Next door.

5494
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
And starting to get into that pretty hard.

5495
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Which is great.

5496
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Perfect.

5497
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Next question is.

5498
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Can we be able to trade mats?

5499
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
We are not.

5500
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
You're not able to trade mats.

5501
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And that's not something we're currently looking at doing.

5502
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
It's possible we could in the future.

5503
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
But right now it is nothing.

5504
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
No.

5505
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
No trading on mats.

5506
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Yeah.

5507
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
This is the one thing that we mentioned earlier.

5508
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Is that.

5509
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,000
It would regard very major changes to how item factions currently work.

5510
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Fair enough.

5511
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Yeah.

5512
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Any improvement slash changes to localization coming?

5513
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Yes.

5514
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Yes.

5515
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Yes.

5516
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Yeah.

5517
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I think that's it.

5518
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Yeah.

5519
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
We want.

5520
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
We want the localization to be good.

5521
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Yeah.

5522
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,000
So.

5523
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Yeah.

5524
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
It's always.

5525
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
We either just expanded it.

5526
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Or are expanding the languages.

5527
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I don't know.

5528
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I don't know if that's out yet or not.

5529
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,000
All right.

5530
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
A lot of languages now.

5531
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Fair enough.

5532
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Will we be able to control somehow the Weaver's tablets via the COF Observatory Prophecies?

5533
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:25,000
There is nothing specifically interacting with the COF and the Weaver stuff like that.

5534
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
There are things that naturally just work together.

5535
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
But there isn't a very specific interaction like that.

5536
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Yeah.

5537
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:39,000
So if you have something in COF that says like you just get more of this thing and then the Weaver stuff drops that thing, you get more of that thing from dropping it.

5538
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:39,000
All right.

5539
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,000
What about making it easier to actually pick up items from the floor without having to click precisely on it?

5540
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
UI scaling is coming.

5541
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
So you'll be able to make them bigger if you'd like to be able to have a bigger target to click.

5542
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Nice.

5543
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
So that's just loot filter improvements.

5544
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Is that my understanding of it?

5545
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:57,000
No.

5546
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Like we're scaling the entire UI options now.

5547
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
So you can crank the size of everything, the whole UI up or down.

5548
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Yeah.

5549
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Player agency again.

5550
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I've said this before.

5551
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I think it's fantastic.

5552
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Yeah.

5553
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I think here's also like a pickup radius or like how far away you can click to pick up items to not run to it.

5554
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
I don't remember if we have any changes to that.

5555
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
It is something we discussed at some point.

5556
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
And I think it was overall just yes, we should do it.

5557
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I don't remember if we did it.

5558
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
It's one of those.

5559
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
I guess we're going to bring it up now and see if we can, you know, if we didn't, maybe we can.

5560
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:33,000
You know, I don't know.

5561
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
That's good.

5562
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
I mean, that's also one of those.

5563
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
You can only make it bigger.

5564
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
You can never go back once you made it bigger.

5565
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
So it's a very touchy topic, right?

5566
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Next question is plans for seasonal objectives.

5567
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
That's something we're very interested in down the road.

5568
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Season two does not have seasonal objectives with like the whole thing.

5569
01:50:53,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I think there's there are lots of great examples of that where there's like complete these bosses and, you know, finish this challenge in game.

5570
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And you get this like cosmetic thing for the season to remember to like, so you can remember having completed that challenge in the game.

5571
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:07,000
You look back at that season.

5572
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
These are all awesome stuff.

5573
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:09,000
You get achievements.

5574
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
We're interested in diving into that world.

5575
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
We don't have them for season two yet.

5576
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:23,000
We have invested time into making the game better instead of keeping you playing more from giving you free MTX.

5577
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Basically, it's friendly.

5578
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
It is something that we definitely want to do.

5579
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
They're really cool.

5580
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
We just have other priorities being on the game right now.

5581
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:32,000
That's fair.

5582
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Is the Uber Abaroth fight accessed through the same method as the normal one?

5583
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
No, kind of.

5584
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
You need to kill a normal Abaroth to get Uber Abaroth.

5585
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:51,000
It drops a WoW Echo that you put into your Echo Web if you have a high enough corruption on it.

5586
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
And then you'll fight Uber Abaroth.

5587
01:51:53,000 --> 01:52:02,000
And important to note is that even though it is in the Echo Web, modifiers or corruption does not affect the difficulty of that.

5588
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
It's a static fight.

5589
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,000
And you will have access to it way before your character is trying to fight it.

5590
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
So similar to the Abaroth.

5591
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:11,000
All right.

5592
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
It is a lot harder to fight than normal Abaroth.

5593
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,000
So a good follow-up question to this is actually what corruption is the Uber Abaroth balance around?

5594
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
What do you expect players to be at when they can't clear him?

5595
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
A lot.

5596
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Can we tell you when you can access it?

5597
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Is that something we can say?

5598
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I don't know.

5599
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yeah, I think we can say when you're able to access it.

5600
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yeah.

5601
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Yeah, it's 500 corruption.

5602
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
500.

5603
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
And that is...

5604
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
You need a minimum 500 to access it.

5605
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,000
But even if you're able to farm 500, it's going to be a very, very difficult fight.

5606
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:43,000
All right.

5607
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:48,000
So you should be significantly higher for it to be a comfortable fight is what you're saying.

5608
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Yeah.

5609
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:54,000
The interesting bit is that once you put it into your Echo Web, if you fail, you can just, you know, you can go again.

5610
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Ah, that's nice actually.

5611
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:03,000
There might be some stuff like maybe not giving you the loot.

5612
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I'm not sure.

5613
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
But we probably do need to do something there.

5614
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
But yeah, you can just keep fighting it.

5615
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Okay.

5616
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Next question is, can Woven Echo's items change the corruption of the Echo it is applied to somehow?

5617
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:24,000
There is one Woven Echo that does change the corruption of that timeline.

5618
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
We already talked about that one.

5619
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Yeah, the one that copies the highest corruption of that player.

5620
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Yeah.

5621
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
So that's the only one so far that is fitting this question.

5622
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:38,000
There might be one more.

5623
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:43,000
I don't think there's any Woven Echo that change the corruption of the Echo it's.

5624
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
No, because the corruption is based on the timeline.

5625
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
So whatever the timeline's corruption is, the corruption is for the Echoes.

5626
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Okay.

5627
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Following this up, we have, can there be more sinks for rare materials?

5628
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Oh, sinks.

5629
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Yes.

5630
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:12,000
But, I mean, the, well, some, one of the rare materials is going away.

5631
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,000
And the new ones that are there are, you know, like, I think you're going to be wanting to use them up on your items.

5632
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Because I think you're going to get more opportunities to craft good items.

5633
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Because there's going to be more base types that are potentially awesome.

5634
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Because these new crafting materials are available for you.

5635
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
So I think, yeah, just the existence of them is going to make you use more of them.

5636
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Okay.

5637
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Fair enough.

5638
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Can you guys talk about how much better arenas are now?

5639
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:41,000
If at all.

5640
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Sorry.

5641
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I'd add that.

5642
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,000
You can influence them through the Weaver tree.

5643
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I mean, one is you can just not do them at all.

5644
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
But you can also just add some other stuff to it.

5645
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And the base functionality of it is also, I think they are, the enemies are faster.

5646
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I think they, so they come to you much faster if you stand in the middle.

5647
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I think.

5648
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Time between waves, I think, is reduced as well.

5649
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Yeah.

5650
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Yeah.

5651
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
We did a bunch of, like, small adjustments to it.

5652
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:21,000
I've heard, I've had at least a few people say that, that hated them, say that they're kind of fine now.

5653
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
So.

5654
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Okay.

5655
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
That's a good sign for me.

5656
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I was never a big fan of them.

5657
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
I'll have to try them out.

5658
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,000
There's more mechanics, like, of the, like, the side mechanics and things that spawn in the know as well.

5659
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Mm-hmm.

5660
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:34,000
All right.

5661
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Next question.

5662
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I think there's, like, no way that any of the extra mechanics could appear in them.

5663
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
But I think at least champions can now.

5664
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Well, that's, that's kind of big, though.

5665
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I think.

5666
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
If it's true, since you said think.

5667
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Yeah.

5668
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I'm, like, 80% sure on that one.

5669
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Okay.

5670
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Next question is, can you guys talk about, no, sorry, are portal charms consumables?

5671
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Yes.

5672
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I believe you guys covered this in the last interview.

5673
01:55:59,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Yes.

5674
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:11,000
And a good refresher is that you can trade any of the three existing dungeon keys in Majelka in Divine Era.

5675
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I think there's an NPC there that you can trade up those keys for portal charms.

5676
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
So, that's it.

5677
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Yeah.

5678
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,000
If you only care about temporal sanctum, but you have a lot of the other two, you can just trade them up for what the portal charms.

5679
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:24,000
All right.

5680
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Is the damage taken increase from dual wield being changed?

5681
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:31,000
No.

5682
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:32,000
No.

5683
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,000
This is a very interesting, like, both the deciding and balancing topic.

5684
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Because it's like, okay, do we want dual wielding to be, like, so we have a sword and board, then we have, like, two-handing, and then we have dual wield.

5685
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Where should the dual wield fall in, like, in the middle?

5686
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Like, should it be doing the most damage?

5687
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Should it be doing more damage than a sword and board, but be slightly tankier than with a shield or with a two-hander?

5688
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:10,000
And I think we fell on that you just take more damage, but you're, in most cases, doing more damage.

5689
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Fair enough.

5690
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Are Forge Guard minions robots?

5691
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
I have no idea what that means.

5692
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
That was the question I got.

5693
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Yes.

5694
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:22,000
And no.

5695
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Okay.

5696
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Yes, and no.

5697
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
They have feelings.

5698
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I mean, I think I can make a robot out of Lego.

5699
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
My manifest armor has feelings, okay?

5700
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,000
I mean, that's coming from a true summoner perspective.

5701
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I didn't know you were a real summoner, Karv.

5702
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
What has changed?

5703
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I've been a summoner player since forever.

5704
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:47,000
What do you mean?

5705
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Well, not always.

5706
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Not always.

5707
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
We've seen how happy you were playing Heartseeker.

5708
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
I'm just saying.

5709
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Yeah, there you go.

5710
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Speaking of Heartseeker, what level is it to learn Heartseeker?

5711
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
It's past the chains.

5712
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
How many points in?

5713
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
20 for the base class, and then how many points in for the marksman?

5714
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:10,000
30.

5715
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I think it's 30.

5716
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I can make a look.

5717
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I can confirm.

5718
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I'm sure it's 30.

5719
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Okay, so around 50 skill points in, which means...

5720
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Yes, regards 30, yes.

5721
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Yeah, so the level then would be, depending on how many skill points you got from the campaign,

5722
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,000
right?

5723
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Yeah.

5724
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
And that kind of summarizes the Q&A.

5725
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Before the little outro, I have two more things to cover there in the outro.

5726
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:39,000
I'm curious, Mr. Minion Lover, what are you playing as your starter for Season 2 yourself?

5727
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Ooh, I don't know.

5728
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
It has to be minions now.

5729
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I'm just saying.

5730
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I mean, does Falcon count?

5731
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
I could play a bow falconer.

5732
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I don't know.

5733
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Who knows?

5734
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
A falcon does not count.

5735
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:53,000
No.

5736
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Okay.

5737
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Okay.

5738
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
I think I'm going to play...

5739
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Either I'm going to play Heartseeker or I'm going to play something Sentinel, Void Knight,

5740
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:02,000
probably.

5741
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Void Knight.

5742
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
What about you, Mike?

5743
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
I'm running it.

5744
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I've been saying this for months now.

5745
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I'm going full Heartseeker.

5746
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
There's no question in my mind.

5747
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It is...

5748
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
My favorite class has always been Marksman.

5749
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
And it's the first time we've had a new skill for it since it launched.

5750
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
It is Marksman, Marksman, Marksman for me.

5751
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:18,000
I'm playing Heartseeker.

5752
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Fair enough.

5753
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Fair enough.

5754
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,000
So the last question before the outro, we're going to wrap this up, is obviously the common

5755
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
question that we've seen on Twitter when we talk about Bex many years ago.

5756
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:29,000
You all know what it is.

5757
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
And that is patch notes when?

5758
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:33,000
When they're ready.

5759
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Just don't give us a patch of three days before launch.

5760
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Give us at least a week.

5761
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
You will have several dates to read through all of the changes for sure.

5762
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:46,000
But I don't know.

5763
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I don't think we can give you the actual dates.

5764
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
We asked.

5765
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
We're not allowed to say the patch notes date.

5766
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I'm sorry.

5767
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
We did check before this.

5768
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Okay.

5769
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
A follow-up to that.

5770
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:00,000
When you say several days, can we as a collective then say that we would prefer to see them around

5771
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
a week before and not just a couple of days?

5772
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Is that something that is more in line with what's going to go down?

5773
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Or we're talking literally a couple of days?

5774
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Give or take.

5775
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
I think we'll keep staying on the several.

5776
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Okay.

5777
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Yeah.

5778
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
We just can't.

5779
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
We asked, but we weren't.

5780
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
We've only done too much damage anyway.

5781
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Okay.

5782
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Come on.

5783
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Let's keep our jobs here.

5784
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Avoid the suing process.

5785
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,000
We're going to wrap this up by thanking Mike and Carver coming on for this interview.

5786
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
It's been a blast.

5787
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Thank you so much for putting your job at risk and everything.

5788
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Appreciate that very much.

5789
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Next week, Friday, same time, I believe, right?

5790
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
You guys will be having a friend of mine talkative try to talk about itemizations.

5791
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I'll be sure tuning into that.

5792
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Hope you guys that are watching will tune into that as well.

5793
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
And show us the love for last Deep Book.

5794
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:52,000
And I'm very excited for the launch on the 2nd of April.

5795
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Thanks so much for coming in, boys.

5796
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
And I'll see you guys later.

5797
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Thanks for having us.

5798
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Great time.

5799
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Yep.

5800
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Thanks.

5801
02:00:59,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Bye.

5802
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
And we're out.

5803
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Woo.

5804
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Let me see.

5805
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Uh.
