11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
okay three two one greetings and welcome travelers to a very special episode of the still sane podcast

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
i am here with the amazing team behind last epoch season two tombs of the erased to talk all about

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
this latest update coming to the game it has been nine months they have been cooking and i thought it

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
would be an awesome way to introduce all of you and to just break the ice if all of you could talk

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
about your single favorite feature that is coming in tombs of the erased what are you most excited for

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
can we start with judd let's start with you man for sure for sure uh yeah we have a lot of heavy hitters

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
coming in season two in this regard um i'll speak to one that i'm personally really excited about that

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
might not get a lot of coverage elsewhere in the conversation um so for gamepad we've actually updated

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
every single skills targeting logic across the game and there was way more intuitive to how you'd

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
want them to play so for example if you were playing ballista in the past it would be that you would

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
if you're focusing on an enemy it would actually summon the ballista on top of the targeted enemy

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
which would aggro the enemy and probably surrounding enemies and they'd swarm your ballista and pretty

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
quickly dispatch it and kill it and that's not exactly how you'd want ballista to be played

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
with the update we've made it to where even if you're focused on a target enemy

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
uh it'll act more appropriately where it'll cast it to the side or outside of the group of monsters

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
which is a way better situation for ballista we've also updated all the mutations of skills so anything

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
inside the skill trees that actually might change the targeting logic or more desirably uh have the

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
target logic change uh for example things like a terror's blessing there is a there's a node called purge

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
which cleanses ailments off of allies and uh with the with the update if you do have an ally that has

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
an ailment on it purge and it turns blessing will prioritize healing that character instead those are

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
just a couple examples every single skill in the game has gone through this treatment and been touched

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
um oh and and there's also we've updated it to have some target memory as well uh so for example if

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you're a ranged character imagine that you're a mage and you're casting fireball uh previously it

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
would be that if you're casting fireball at an enemy a couple times they start to chase you

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
you start to kite it you start to run in the other direction what you would previously have to do is

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
flick your joystick to the left run away uh then you have to flick it back to the right and start to

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
you know sling the spell again and flick it back to the left um in the update we will memorize the

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
target in which you were casting the spell at previously and as long as there's not a new target

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
recognized uh in the direction that you're facing with the gamepad uh you can just quickly it'll

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
just quickly turn around and cast the spell at that previous enemy which makes it just way way more

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
fluid um and so a lot of really great gamepad updates coming in season two uh there's even more

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
changes to support this like the inventory management updates that we have coming and there's a lot more

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
uh updates that we have coming for gamepad in future seasons as well that are already well underway

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
um and remember if you guys like playing on gamepad uh it is something that you're able to hot swap to

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
from keyboard and mouse which is just a real cool feature to have that's really exciting i know a lot

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
of people love the options and there's a lot of you know i think like older gamers too that really like

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the ease that gamepad provides so that's that's awesome you guys focused on that man it's very cool

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
all right oh yep hands raised right now yeah so uh yeah that was me indicating the rsi that you get

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
from playing oh yeah yeah i think i think half our team has terrible carpal tunnel from uh picking up

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
a whole lot of loot over the years so yeah i i mostly pay with gamepad uh just just due to that

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
100 all right ross what are you looking forward to man yeah i'm personally i'm most excited for the

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
procedurally generated tomb and cemetery side zones that we've added um in season two there are a few

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
features that would be developed specifically for long-term use and this is one of those um what we've built

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
allows the studio to both release new content faster and improve existing content uh for example

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
you know let's just see in future seasons we add new areas that are tied to seasonal mechanics or we

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
want to improve existing areas like dungeons or base monolith echoes uh the new system we've worked on

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
enables to do that a lot faster than previously um specifically in relation to season two though um we

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
haven't had side zones in end game before uh and tombs are really the starting point for all of the new

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
end game content that we've added uh these new zones feel good in terms of not being too large not

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
being too small uh there's no loading screens when going back and forth we've got new enemies bosses and

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
rewards with them as well uh with the extra time we've had we've actually made some solid last minute

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
improvements here too like rotating the layouts to navigate areas better with wasd movement um which

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
we're also adding this season so basically you're always traveling in a direction that's comfortable for

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
wasd in terms of you know the exits and entrances from areas that sounds like a small thing but it's

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
great if you're using that control scheme uh note that future zones there will be built with this in

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
mind you know we're likely to revisit older content too in this regard as well um but yeah for me looking

67
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
forward to playing all the content this season but the procedural generation system has me the most

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
excited for you know the future development of the game the wasd change sounds big i know what you mean

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
it sounds small but it makes a massive difference especially if you're grinding through these many

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
times over and you want to try out the beta and you got an extra few weeks to work on it so

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
wasd should feel a little bit better than it was going to on that april 2nd initial launch

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
absolutely oh i'm excited for that awesome okay carve let's close this out what are you most

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
excited yeah there's a lot of things but my price is probably on the the viewer tree

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
because it allows me to do a lot of cool stuff in the model is like not have arenas anymore and a lot

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
of uh target farming for items wait a second you don't like arenas either what i do like arenas i

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
don't like them in the model yet okay when i do i'll go very cool i saw that mike leaked the entire tree

77
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
on stream last week yeah we might maybe look at some notes today potentially at some point oh okay

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
exciting well you guys before we dive into the main topic of today's chat which is all about

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
itemization and you have a bunch of exciting things to share i had one question that i just wanted to

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to ask all of you because personally i've played about 150 hours of last epoch i'm not a blaster by any means

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
but the i usually bounced in the end game and i think that a lot of other players shared that

82
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
sentiment but in these past nine months it sounds like you have done tremendous work on that end game

83
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
loop and just providing new options not in not only in terms of content but itemization as well

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
did one of you want to tackle that what what is this new end game supposed to feel like supposed to do

85
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and accomplish yeah and so in terms of the goals uh in short we wanted to improve end game respond to

86
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
player feedback and set us up for future content and you can split all these between short-term goals

87
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and long-term goals so i'll start with the short-term goals so uh looking back season one added a pinnacle

88
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
boss um the which the game lacked um it didn't feel right that there wasn't a satisfying endpoint uh for

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
end game in this regard um both in terms of difficulty and narratively um so this was great

90
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
content uh but it didn't add much to the end game holistically um so the primary short-term goal with

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
season two was providing more content broadly at end game uh giving players more to do and allowing

92
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
them to sink more time into min-maxing their characters uh we knew we wanted to provide some

93
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
element of player agency in terms of influencing the monolith um that's the weaver tree that car was

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
mentioning um we knew we needed new bosses new enemies and we wanted to tie in more end game

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
itemization and crafting into the monolith um we've only really had that with the eternity cache

96
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
which is more in dungeons so not specifically tied to the monolith um we were also keen to add our first

97
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
side zones to echoes as well um as that experience just didn't exist before um and then the secondary

98
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
short-term goal there was responding to player feedback so that includes a lot of changes like overall

99
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
game balance so buffs to perform underperforming skills and reducing the power of a few extremely

100
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
over performing skills uh improving the balance between ward and health uh adjusting enemy damage

101
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
over time and by adjusting i mean reducing it um and making changes to boss ward um and we've also

102
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
added a bunch of quality of life features that people have been asking for things like auto stashing

103
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
mastery respect and so on uh so all these short-term goals are around basically wanting to keep

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
players more engaged with the end game so exactly interesting try um in terms of long-term goals

105
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
that was simple uh we knew we needed to develop a procedural generation system for long term as

106
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
mentioned before uh and we also wanted to add in mechanics in season two that would also integrate

107
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
well with future seasonal content of the game so things like the weaver tree and woven echo influence

108
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
those features will likely make an appearance when we're talking about future seasonal mechanics

109
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
uh so yeah to recap improve end game respond to player feedback and just set things up nicely for

110
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the long term the woven echoes look very interesting especially the post from the first day of hype week

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
yesterday a few of the previous i'm just very excited for the special encounters and reward types that are

112
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
locked behind those and i know this you know wasn't in in my list but uber avarath okay how hard is he has

113
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
anyone in the office downed him easily or or is this like a we'll leave it to the players to try to

114
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
down this dude eventually car have you done yeah i don't i don't i don't think there's been many people

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
who have done it did you uh you know did you do it ethically or was it a little bit of a dev build you

116
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
know giving yourself some power i've done both i've done both i've done both awesome i think we've had some

117
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
i think we've had some community tester members that have done it uh yeah yeah we have people spend a

118
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
lot of time testing that fight should be pretty blood free so that's good we okay well that's exciting

119
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
i'm really excited to dive into that end game and the rest of these item related questions so let's

120
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
kick it off with that end game itemization so first question i wanted to touch on is how much control over

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
your end game do you now have with itemized or craftable end game encounters and as you just said

122
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
they will be expanded continuously so do you have any you know ideas of what you want to do in the

123
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
short term so uh most of seasons two's end game content is via woven echoes which are items that

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
drop and then you place them into the echo web um note that these woven echoes aren't craftable as

125
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
such you know you're not sitting there and re-rolling them they're looking for specific modifiers and

126
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
things like that uh in terms of setup all you need to do is insert them into the echo web and run them

127
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
uh some woven echoes have corruption requirements to be able to place them but that's about it

128
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
um so in terms of influencing the monolith in terms of its rewards and encounters most of that is done

129
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
via the progression and the faction and usage of the weaver tree rather than modifying woven echoes

130
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
directly if that makes sense um in the past we've talked about itemizing monolith modifiers you

131
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
know we even come up with a fairly concrete plan for that uh but for now we're more keen on keeping

132
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
echoes easy to run with pretty little setup um one element that we will be using more in future

133
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
updates though is woven echo influence so you know when placing a woven echo there'll be a circular area

134
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and that area will influence nearby monolith echoes so as as mentioned before when we have a new seasonal

135
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
mechanic in a future update perhaps you'll be able to use woven echo influence to add elements of that

136
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
mechanic to surrounding echoes and things like that but yeah to summarize you influence the experience

137
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
in the monolith through the systems provided by the faction rather than crafting on the woven echoes

138
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
got it okay and uber ever is the top tier woven echo correct is is there anything that's kind of

139
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
close to him that requires a really high corruption to fight there so i think it's like 500 corruption

140
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
or something that you need to access it but it's way more difficult than 500 corruption is so we just

141
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
the same with normal abhorus where we give you access to it earlier than you probably are ready for it in

142
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
many cases just because we just we don't want to make you slog through like a long time and then you just

143
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
instantly kill whatever comes your way but in terms of difficulty uh abhorus is probably the second

144
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
hardest encounter in the game unless we like start thinking about pushing high very high corruption and then

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
you doing this uh woven echoes there because some of them do scale with modifiers and corruption but in terms of like

146
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
the earliest that you get access to uh abhorus will be the second hardest fight still then we have uber

147
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
abhorus and there are some there's some bosses coming back that people have wanted to see and some not wanted to see that are

148
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
are going to be uh regarding some corruption you're obviously talking about lagone right the ones people

149
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
don't want to see right there there will be no one echo with lagone okay there's no logo on there

150
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
awesome okay he i have not been stuck on a boss in an aarpg as long as i was with lagone and then when

151
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
it clicked it clicked and i've been able to down him easily every time so it just it took a little bit

152
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
all right he's not that bad guys he's not that bad okay thanks for that answer ross that's awesome

153
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
okay this next one has to do with something that the community brought to my attention so there's a

154
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
there's a bunch going on with legendary potential in this update uh however lots of people have expressed

155
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
that if you find an item with one legendary potential it's it's kind of useless it's kind of a feel

156
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
bad moment so are there any additional options coming for lower legendary potential items like

157
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
the one lp items that i just mentioned or are those going to stay as like the oh well that could have

158
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
been a two or three right yeah um so we're adding a couple of new features to help with the sort of uh

159
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
actually saying the the life cycle of uniques um so let's just say you've got a bunch of relatively

160
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
common uniques uh with low legend legendary potential uh previously that was unfortunately the end of

161
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
the road for those items um however with the new end game crafting options via woven echoes you have

162
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
a chance to redeem these items um so for example one woven echo has a crafting reward that allows you

163
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
to insert a bunch of unique items with real legend potential and mass re-roll the values on those items

164
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
so that so that has a low chance to improve the legendary potential of those items and a higher chance

165
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
to effectively fail and set the legendary potential to zero note though that if that does happen you can of

166
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
course use the nemesis system to improve that and see what happens you know you might get lucky with

167
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
the affixes that are chosen there or you might regain the legendary potential there um one additional

168
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
note on legendary potential is that it is of course weighted depending on the unique in question so for

169
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
rarer uniques one legendary potential is already great um and it's even more powerful now with a recent

170
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
change to the eternity cache that i think judd and mike have hinted at previously um so hopefully carve is set up to demo that for us just now

171
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
um he's been granted immunity to show things at this point so he's safe you know his career

172
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
no problems there okay awesome sounds good carve go for the screen share and we'll swap you on over

173
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
yeah and before i actually show what it is okay we can we can do a hi we're talking about about why

174
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
uh because uh that's uh yeah let me know when you have i think it should be good uh i'll look at chat

175
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
one more time just to make sure it's all set chat can you see the leaker's screen right now

176
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
good to go go for it we're just teasing here okay we know leaking here so you know how you you have these

177
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
very good items that you get your one lb on and then you probably farm it a couple times before you

178
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
actually hit your uh t7 int or whatever you want and then you somehow you know get lucky and you get

179
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
two lp and you feel like okay i just got a massive upgrade because two lp is better than one lp on the

180
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
item that you already have one lp then you farm basically the same item maybe a bit better than

181
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
you use on the previous uh slam uh and then you just miss you just miss you don't get the t7 at all

182
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and now your two lp that you thought you felt like was an upgrade is basically going to the trash

183
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
bin well there's a there's a use case for that in in season two but that item doesn't really go to

184
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:35,000
trash bin anymore because um we are now allowing you to select one affix as a guarantee as long as

185
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:46,000
the dungeon that you do is at least tier two so i i got lucky and i have a two lp red ring here so i can

186
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,000
just guarantee the int there and then i get something extra cool oh

187
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and this does mean that it's also easier to get uh one affix on your legendaries as well

188
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
for example you don't really need to farm on average for red rings anymore to get that you just

189
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
slam it there now on the first attempt unless of course we allow you to uh go full rng mode and

190
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
that just still picks it at random because you know streamers need to show that they are they are

191
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
good at the game and they're lucky but yeah for us peasants we can we can just force and the one affix

192
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,000
we want the other affixes for like 2 lp 3 lp are still going to be random of course but yeah that's

193
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
awesome it's going to help a lot people are freaking out they're very very excited for this change

194
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that's awesome you you may have maybe maybe deliberately missed out one potential thing that

195
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
could happen here as well car i maybe oh yeah yeah uh so you know how you when you're crafting your normal

196
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
items in the forge and sometimes you get this nice sound and instead of craft like getting plus one

197
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
tier you get plus two tiers with the critical success now there is a very very low chance

198
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
uh when you're making legendaries to get critical success with uh eternity cash too which then just

199
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,000
takes another affix from the item so this could have been uh 3 lp but uh as with just getting legendary

200
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
potential on uniques the the more powerful the item is the less likely you are to crit success and

201
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
it's very rare to begin with but so don't expect it to be happening on your red rings anytime soon but

202
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
there's a chance now there's a chance here we have some some numbers on that chance like are we talking

203
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,000
you know one percent half a percent low enough that you don't really think about it and then if it

204
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
happens it happens it happens and you're you're happy oh sweet

205
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
well that's pretty awesome should i should i take the magic away carve

206
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
for now yeah for now i'll have to uh prepare another thing all right we're gonna take the magic away

207
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
everybody okay i'm sorry we'll see more magic in just a second i promise i promise everybody

208
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:36,000
all right there we go okay magic is gone for now that was pretty awesome yeah wow sweet thanks for

209
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
sharing that carve okay we've been we've been excited to share that one i i was i was seeing more huge w's

210
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
in the chat than i've ever seen before on the live stream pretty awesome okay so after that wow that was

211
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,000
a big one okay another i think this was the most requested question in like discord on the subreddit

212
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
when i was doing some prep sessions on youtube and twitch people are also curious about idol crafting

213
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
okay they're like super interested in additional details on how that's gonna work you know what these

214
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
idols are gonna look like and i know you did elaborate a little bit on idols in yesterday's post

215
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
but if there's anything else you'd like to share here today with everybody watching feel free go for

216
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
it what's going on with idols yeah season two yeah i can i can just show it in action quickly oh my gosh

217
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
oh he's leaking again okay he's fast oh he's going again okay here we go here we go here we go he's

218
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:50,000
really fast we're back in game go for it man yeah so when you complete tombs or cemeteries uh or some of

219
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the woven echo versions of these you'll see this little uh thing here um on my left side and this is

220
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
where you get to place uh your class specific idols uh so here i have a couple that don't have any

221
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:15,000
enchants yet and then here i have a couple that do have so you simply put it here uh i'm in a cemetery

222
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
so i have two uses if this was on a two it would be uh only be one and i'll just enchant it it'll

223
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:32,000
give it a uh new usually a load here so this this gave me a tier two enchant uh this can go all the way

224
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
to tier seven and it gives you some weaver's touch as well which you see on the top on the item uh

225
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:48,000
so it has four weaver's touch and uh just like weaver's will items um you can just go slay enemies

226
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and it'll upgrade or you can use uh that's the wrong rune uh you can use rune of weaving that will then

227
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
convert uh some of that uh in our case it put all of it and it just upgraded so now i have a tier six

228
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
of that um that's really interesting because generally you would actually get the second

229
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
affix there as well uh so that's an interesting uh coincidence let's see if we can get it on the other

230
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:27,000
one uh there we go so here we have two uh new affixes and they are tier five and tier one so we

231
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
are missing but eight total tiers if you're very lucky just like with weaver's items like weaver's

232
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:42,000
real items you can get up to double t7 here uh which in viewers will items would be like quadruple t7

233
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
but that's obviously very rare so yeah i'd expect people to get like tier seven and then like tier two

234
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,000
three maybe four on top or something like that um and uh of course i didn't get what i wanted

235
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
both of those affixes are kind of useless for me so what i can do is for 500 memory ember which is the

236
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
currency that you can farm now uh for the faction you can re-enchant this

237
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
so what it does it just removes the existing affix or your touch and then it adds a new one

238
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
could be lucky or unlucky coding the same one but uh and then you can just keep doing this so when you

239
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
get your perfect normal affixes then you'll just keep re-enchanting until you hit very high weaver's

240
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
touch and the correct affixes on the enchant affix and then done so this is going to be a big thing for

241
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
the memory ember um and memory amber and i was just going to ask really quick that's only found in

242
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
tombs and cemeteries or do you can you find that in other you know instances throughout the game you

243
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
can find it elsewhere too but i would suspect most of your memory ember comes from doing tombs and

244
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
cemeteries and yeah uh i believe these are also already teased as well you see these uh little

245
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,000
other idols here uh so obviously since you're putting more power into class specific idols the the normal

246
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
like the one by one and two by one and one by two idols would get left behind so in these tombs and

247
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,000
cemeteries you can find new subtypes of these smaller idols uh you can find minor uh small i think

248
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
minor was small lagonian previously so we renamed that and you see there's a different color affix on

249
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:48,000
the top uh so these uh idols have an exclusive better affixes compared to the non-weaver version of

250
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the titles and you will always be guaranteed to get at least one of these better affixes on this and

251
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:03,000
sometimes you get two um and most of these are hybrid affixes and better versions of the existing

252
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
ones but there's also some new affixes here uh that i don't think yeah fire pen fire pen and minion fire

253
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
pen is a new one um and then the increased health here with the health on kill is the basically the

254
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
upgraded version of the increased health on the stout uh idols that currently exists i think it goes to

255
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:32,000
six yeah six percent so there's some there's some pretty good weaver idols too uh that you can you can

256
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
find yeah it looks like it now people are pointing out the uses on the woven enchanter is that tied to

257
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
anything or is that a base amount or every time you clear one of these uh cemeteries

258
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
tombs you get one in cemeteries where i am currently you get two and then some of the higher end uh

259
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
woven echoes uh can grant up to four i think there's three and four uh for one of the higher ones

260
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
whoa look at those woven echoes right there oh that was interesting yeah they're they're they're

261
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
pretty cool wow i wonder nice icons on them i really like the icon i mean your cursor could slip like a few

262
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
inches maybe you know

263
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
do it yeah

264
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
this one isn't uh specific to itemization unless we are thinking corruption that's one

265
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
oh yeah yeah

266
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
there's some some cool things in there that was a good slip i liked it that that was a good slip i

267
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
wasn't even i didn't even remember which is where so that was actually just a random one

268
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and yes the the plus icon on those woven echoes tells you that you can get a weaver tree point by

269
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
completing that woven echo um the the the hammer implies that it has a crafting reward at the end and

270
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the skull is a boss encounter at the end and then the rest of them are more varied you're actually in we

271
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
are actually in a cemetery of reweaving right now uh i believe where one of these rewards is

272
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
you know not all of these woven echoes are going to be awesome for you you might not like them uh some

273
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
of them so what you can do is you know you can just post them here and

274
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
exchange them and hope that you get better ones you can exchange them all at once and and it'll come out with

275
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
three oh my goodness gracious you don't have to do three at a time yeah and it didn't waste that

276
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
yeah yeah you can just fill this up and it's just like puts them all there well that's that's pretty

277
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
nice if i do say so myself and it's it is pretty satisfying and we're leaking some more here teasing

278
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
teasing more it's yeah i love how it's just like looks there's like a little rhythm there too yeah oh

279
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
there's a little sound effect that we can't oh nice nice yeah i'm currently muted here so yeah that's

280
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:09,000
good yeah very cool well that was beautiful thank you for showing off those idols carve

281
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:17,000
people appreciate it oh wait what should i should what was that i'll i'll i'll just i'll just uh it's

282
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
it's just the exit back to the uh okay all right all right here i'll stop watching and the magic will

283
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
stop for just a little bit longer you guys maybe some more magic come on in i i believe i need to

284
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:38,000
prepare more magic now oh more magic okay okay awesome sweet that was beautiful okay it's it is

285
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
i'm sorry it's just making me giddy how happy everyone is in the chat you guys have done a phenomenal job

286
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:54,000
they're freaking out okay so uh moving on from idols now uh in the ziz and racks interview uh holly did a

287
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
great breakdown of set crafting and lots of people are happy this made the cut for season two because

288
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
it was like teetering on the edge there for a bit and bam revealed set crafting's in season two so on

289
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,000
that is there since this is the itemization talk is there anything extra we can dive into when it comes

290
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:23,000
to set crafting and what players should expect on launch day on the 17th yeah uh as i'm preparing here to

291
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:34,000
get my uh showcase of shattering them uh i guess i can talk a bit so set items are they're kind of

292
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
problematic in a way where if you can't modify them in any way it's like a it's like a dead-end item

293
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
right you either use it or you don't um obviously there's different ways to make them

294
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:56,000
be useful or modify them uh we didn't want to just do legendary potential but for set items because

295
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
it's it's we already have that we might as well do something other cool because we got ideas

296
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:13,000
um and this allows us to basically not have set items be a dead end in a sense like a dead slot like

297
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
oh there's no movement anymore yeah yeah i get that yeah yeah now now you will most likely keep

298
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
improving the set items that you have as you'll find better ones and you try to get uh you know

299
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
higher tiers of the set affix because they have all the way to tier seven and i am i'm ready to share

300
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
some more again oh you are okay we're swapping over to the magic screen again then

301
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:47,000
here we are you're good to go carve yeah so i am at the end of the great bridge uh where we see this

302
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:55,000
nice little green clovey thing uh where you can put your set items uh obviously i didn't have my

303
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
set items with me so i'll just open my stash from here and this little nice button uh and see where

304
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
we go there we go that's that's that's a couple sets there uh

305
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
i don't remember what the key combinations here are so i'm just going to do it this way i'm pretty

306
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
sure you can do it um manually but there we go shift that's that's the button and then again we see

307
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
a couple uses so you can just fill this up and then you do that we get the really cool

308
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
stuff here and we have a bunch of

309
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
affixes on the ground and each of these affixes so they have their name like this is corusor's blood

310
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
call so this is very this is only going to work uh on helmets

311
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and i can probably we can probably craft maybe some set items maybe

312
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:01,000
i'll show you some um that would be cool villatrias maybe everybody likes villatrias right yeah

313
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
so just like any other affix uh you can just craft it there now and now this is a villatrias

314
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:22,000
downfall reforged uh each of the set item we pick basically two modifiers uh what yeah and this is

315
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,000
this is now a tier one this would actually be a very good contender for just uh sealing off because

316
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
you get the shock duration per int and then you just get the the base uh conversion for meteor

317
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and then you can just craft other stats there again but some of them are really powerful at tier 7

318
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,000
uh but there are items that there are sets that would be way too good if the set affix would also

319
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
be great because uh villatrias has the spell damage per int and if you can see it we actually had to

320
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
nerf it it used to be one spell lighting damage per one int but we had to turn it down because it was just

321
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
so good uh when you were able to craft this on a very high-end base with other exalted affixes uh as

322
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:20,000
well is there is there any specific set chad would want to see all right chat come on spam a set

323
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:31,000
let's go what do we want to see go go go okay i see shattered lance yeah i saw two instant oh wow a lot of shattered lance

324
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
uh so you get your added health region and you get some gold damage and

325
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
yes we also had to cap the uh amount of increased damage you can get from shattered lands because the

326
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:58,000
buffs to health region so it it is relatively easy for very like specific uh masteries to get that and i

327
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
actually if you hide very quickly i can show you the tier seven of this all right yeah i'll hide all right

328
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
you go the screen's gonna look funky everybody we're we're kind of hiding let me i'm doing some magic here quick

329
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
there you go he's doing magic everybody okay am i am i am i yeah you're good we can't see oh wait wait actually

330
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
actually actually actually i don't actually know how to hide this let me uh which one i can just you know what i can just stop sharing quick

331
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
oh there you go yeah that works too that works too yeah i was gonna do some like hiding of all the

332
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
different sources and discord so or sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah

333
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
work your magic gotta leave some some stuff to find out okay no on launch day yeah all right we're good

334
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
all right here we go

335
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,000
so that is your tier seven and obviously all of the other affixes here are tier seven as well because magic be

336
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,000
magic um so it can grant you up to 30 added uh melee cold damage and this is kind of interesting

337
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,000
because you can also craft added milk only damage as a normal affix as well so you can get basically

338
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:14,000
twice but obviously the big thing here is the set bonus being just very good uh yeah wow there some of

339
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:22,000
these are pretty good some of these are pretty good okay we're really excited about being able to uh add set items

340
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
more now that we have this system in place so if the community has any ideas for really awesome set items do feel free to uh

341
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
you know plug them plug them in the forums and reddit and our social accounts uh we're really excited to start to add these again

342
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
because right now we have way more uniques than we have set items because you know it was a dead end item slot previously

343
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
how how did this come up like were you guys just workshopping super hard to try to come up with this

344
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
this new idea and you didn't want to step on the toes of legendary potential but you knew you didn't want

345
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:00,000
set items to always be best for some builds out there right i wonder if this one is one is actually one of those

346
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
uh ideas we've just heard in the community and we just kind of workshopped from there this idea this might

347
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,000
be one of those i'm not sure i i don't remember we've had this idea for uh quite a while yeah it just

348
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:23,000
it's a a lot of effort to come to make the system and this is a lot of new affixes with a lot of new

349
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,000
numbers uh it it took a long time getting all the numbers in there for this okay it took a long time

350
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
people are figuring out which of the affixes we take from the sets as well people are asking a crazy

351
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
question i'm not sure if this is allowed or not they're asking can we slap this on uniques

352
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:54,000
no the no without fix it no no the uh the the set affixes cannot be added into uniques okay great

353
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
also people were asking for the last bear that was the other one that i saw being asked a lot is that

354
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
one we could look at which i which slot there's a couple different slots oh gosh which slot first slot

355
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
first slot wins i don't know chest slot go for it

356
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
yes slot is endurance with leech oh this might be one of those sets that we actually buffed and we

357
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
changed the the bonus i'm pretty sure the bonus is better now than it used to be

358
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,000
i might be this i'm not sure if this is one it i think i think i don't think it used to have

359
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
endurance threshold per strength which it now has as a three piece um and obviously the three

360
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
piece set being the 30 strength here is still massive so this is one of those another another

361
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
of those affixes that you might end up just crafting as a tier one and then just sealing it away and then

362
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
crafting another t5 on top yep that's awesome

363
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
uh as you can see some of these so this is a suffix on the body armor it's a prefix so

364
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
is it the suffix or prefix just depends on what the stats kind of make sense to you and in some cases

365
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
uh put it where it has to compete with other powerful affixes um

366
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and here we get health region well increased health region the bear strength uh which is is a pretty

367
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
good especially because this is just either one right now

368
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
i think tier seven goes all the way to three percent strength if i remember correctly

369
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:43,000
so yeah awesome okay we'll definitely see some set items being used uh 100 in season two for sure

370
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
but yeah there's yeah there's a lot of affixes we've added this season you know there's the uh

371
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
set shards there's the affixes for the idols there's the champion affixes there was a there's

372
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
a lot of work to do there and a yeah uh there's there's there's more coming there as well can't see too much

373
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
do you know sweet there's been a lot of affixes have been added in season two yes

374
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
chat you got to calm down we're not going to ask them to show all of the set affixes it's not

375
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
happening okay we got to leave some for april 17th when they launch the game come on come on guys

376
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
yeah all right there's some cool stuff in there yeah definitely all right let's let the magic go away

377
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
okay just for a little bit though i'm sure it'll will return momentarily here you go

378
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
okay maybe we'll give you another another teaser at the end or something who knows

379
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
okay okay all right we'll have to see we'll have to see if chat behaves maybe chat you have to behave

380
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
okay or no teaser you heard carve

381
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
oh it says there we go all right cam's good okay this next one was

382
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
one that i thought would be a little interesting given how much qol is in last epoch i appreciate

383
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
that massively i can like stay in the game when i'm looking at everything whether it's theory

384
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,000
crafting a build or or anything of the sort so is there ever a chance we'd get an in-game compendium

385
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
of unique items with possible drop locations since there are specific places where certain items

386
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
dropped in last epoch it might be an awesome quality of life and incentive to go out and hunt

387
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
for these cool items you know i know you can go on the wiki right some players really like everything

388
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
in game though is that something you guys have ever thought about adding yeah yeah we're really keen on

389
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
things like this keeping players in the game is definitely something that we aspire very heavily to uh

390
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
to do we you know we do this through things like having the game guide in game that has just a wealth of

391
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
knowledge including even things like damage formulas um and then also things like the

392
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
merchant's guild bazaar that keeps you in game without having to go to any external resources to

393
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
target items or players like that so keeping players in game is a really big goal for the studio

394
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
um so this is something that's just right up our alley um maybe this takes shape as something like a

395
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
bestiary or something of that nature i think i think long ago we actually had a a decent mock-up for a

396
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
bestiary and i do think that this would be a very good value add especially as we continue to add

397
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
more and more unique items that are attached to certain activities or behind certain boss loot

398
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
tables uh so so yeah i think that's something that we absolutely could and would benefit from doing

399
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
um i think we have something what is the number of uniques that we have now in the game after this

400
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
patch we're gonna have over 300 or something like that guys a lot yes it's a lot

401
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
more than that yeah that's a lot will come yeah it's getting up there uh so yeah i think it's

402
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
something that we could absolutely do if anybody has any suggestions on how you guys would like to

403
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
see that implemented again we would be very happy to uh take a look at that and if it's something the

404
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
community wants and it's something that we can achieve yeah it's it's something that's again right

405
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
up our alley that's sweet exciting now you're all over 300 unique items now with every update are you

406
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
guys looking to hit like a like a certain number or threshold of uniques added or is it more like

407
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
hey if we have good ideas we're going to try to make them work and if they they make it through all

408
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
the sprints and everything and they're good to go we'll ship them sure yeah you know i i think

409
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
we want to be adding uniques um enough that it hits a wide number of players play styles character

410
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
builds etc etc and with the amount of masteries we have that number is of course a little bit larger

411
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
here uh so we're you know we're trending to have kind of a similar amount for each of these large

412
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
updates and i think that's something that will continue to uh stay at that level or increase

413
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
over time wow there are things that you know implementing a unique item is really it's it's

414
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
fairly low lift for the amount of payoff and we really really enjoy doing it they're just fun things

415
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
for the team to actually go and brainstorm and implement so uh yeah it's something that we we

416
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
definitely are not going to slow down on making unique items and now that we have set items

417
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
in a better spot we'll we'll start to see the variety of items like this uh vary a little bit

418
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,000
more as well good to hear and i might have totally missed this in uh the press already released

419
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
set items are there any new ones coming in this update or is that for future updates

420
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
i don't know if there is any more new ones coming because there was such a large effort in

421
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
getting these set getting all the acting across the line uh it was something that we were you know

422
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
i mean it was probably it was probably towards the uh third week of march or something like that we

423
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
were like can we get this across the line and oh my gosh and we uh we did we slid under the garage

424
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
door as it was closing closing with the uh set crafting but very glad that we did it's something

425
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
that we've been really excited about something that we've had on our minds for a very very long time

426
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
uh you know we've always been pushing for certain uniques to exist inside the game like we've had this

427
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,000
idea for a beekeepers set for some reason uh we as a studio love bees and so we have lots of bee items

428
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
in the bps builds and so uh with with that we'll be able to implement some of these fun ideas that the

429
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,000
team has been talking about for at this point years so okay one more total tangent question you love bees

430
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
you seem to love capybaras too and so does the community could there be i know there's a cosmetic

431
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
coming in the game but you know maybe you actually weave that into gameplay at some point in the

432
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
future you know capybara army sounds pretty cool too yeah do you guys want to see an army of capybaras

433
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,000
destroying your enemies is that is that what chat wants um very possible i wonder how i wonder i bet

434
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
the animation team would have a really good time with that uh i'm not sure if we're gonna do a capybara

435
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,000
swarm of enemies we'll see we'll see i had to throw that in there okay for sure everybody's spamming yes

436
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:53,000
god yes okay of course okay this next question is one of the i'd say one of the age old great

437
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,000
questions of arpgs and it's like a hot button topic in in the genre right now especially and i'd love to

438
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
hear your guys thoughts on it so some arpgs rely on best and slot items being picked up off the floor

439
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
or being crafted uh are you happy where last epoch currently sits on this access or do you think it'll

440
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:20,000
move more and more toward the best items being crafted from scratch as more items are available

441
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
of course there are lots of different systems in last epoch right now that allow you know dropped

442
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
items to be incredible uh but with all this awesome stuff implemented that's again you know lead more

443
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,000
toward that crafting end what do you guys think about it yeah the short answer is that we don't want to

444
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:48,000
spend we don't want to make you spend you know hours and hours on just in town crafting items we'd rather

445
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:55,000
want to see you go slay some enemies and find items and then improve them um that's why we have like the

446
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
exalted stuff for example like you cannot craft it you still have the like even with the new crafting uh

447
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
items like the runes you still have to get those exalted items to drop before you can modify them

448
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:15,000
further so yeah you i don't i don't think last epoch is going to be able to or like i don't think you're

449
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
going to be able to see in last epoch stuff where you pick up an item base and then you craft from the

450
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
ground up okay be the best in slots yeah i don't think that's going to be the case we value finding items

451
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a lot and then just allow you to modify them um different ways well yeah minimal downtime is nice

452
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
it's like the woven echoes right it's you're making choices on your tree and then you're just running

453
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
the woven echoes you're not spending time you know trying to craft and go to the bench and and do a

454
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
whole bunch of stuff there too so that's nice playing monsters is fun i would agree with you and then

455
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,000
having those awesome hits of dopamine when you get those awesome slams so yeah that sounds great okay

456
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:01,000
so here's another one uh that i'm curious about so in your eyes is there an ideal mix of unique items

457
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
and other rarity gear or or is it truly a build-by-build determining factor so kind of meaning like

458
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,000
do you do you think that full unique character builds should exist in your game and mass or are

459
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
the best in slot items almost always going to be those highest tier non-unique rarity

460
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
uh this is this is an interesting one because i don't we are not like very specifically

461
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
trying to make you always have us like a different uh item varieties on your gear it's more so some

462
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:48,000
builds just end up working with a hybrid of having some exalted in season two sets and then legendaries

463
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,000
uh maybe in the future we'll have some items that further in advance incentivize you to stack i don't

464
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,000
know different sets or something like that or exalted and you get bonuses from that so yeah we don't i

465
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:10,000
don't think we are very specifically trying to make sure that that never happens but uh with the the set

466
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:19,000
rework now we're definitely going to be seeing less of full legendaries uh okay than before uh which is

467
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,000
i'd say it's definitely a good thing but that's more so because set items are now just again good in

468
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
uh the use not so that we want you to always have a mix i'd expect there still to be builds that are

469
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:44,000
going to be eventually just using legendaries uh and in the future we might just get some other you

470
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,000
know

471
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
rarities that go in the mix who knows

472
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:57,000
definitely no you like to have open like uh or options open yeah more options is always good

473
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
now something that we've been seeing you know throughout this chat we saw a little glimpse

474
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
earlier woven echoes you know it sounds like everybody's very excited about the introduction

475
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
of these so i'm curious what other cool itemization changes might be coming with the introduction

476
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:19,000
of woven echo echoes in tombs of the erased yeah we could uh we could spend another

477
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
two hours here i guess because all of these there's a lot of changes that uh do a lot of things

478
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
even if we ignore like the woven echoes for six things but i can probably show you a couple

479
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
uh i have one actually prepared already oh already prepared okay magic happening here we go i'm ready

480
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
yes yes

481
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and i believe ross mentioned this earlier uh at the very beginning a bit uh we're having some

482
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:58,000
some things on those uh you know one lp two lp items like that like for example let's let's take

483
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
aberrant uh tonga of the aberrant seer for example this is a item that is quite likely to be able to hit

484
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
roll three or four legendary potential compared to a lot of other items like like red ring for

485
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:20,000
example uh but if you find this with one lp this is basically a dead item this doesn't really have a use

486
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,000
uh zero lp would be better because you could just toss it into the demesyshek and hope to get something

487
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:32,000
good or it would have to be at least like three so one of the things coming uh

488
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
this season is the ability to re-roll the lp

489
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,000
on uniques that have at least one legendary potential uh and if

490
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:56,000
it doesn't go up it's gonna go back to zero uh and again so what happens here is it uh

491
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,000
it basically considers it as finding the item again and then it checks for the legendary potential

492
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
if the legendary potential is not higher than the item it when it's here in the volume potential

493
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
it is gonna go to zero and then you get another chance to upgrade through the nemeshe deck

494
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
but sometimes sometimes you uh get an upgrade and that's pretty cool

495
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:32,000
uh don't expect your red rings to get extra lp again uh because they are already very unlikely to

496
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
get it with lp to begin with uh but there's a point where you know let's say that you're playing

497
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
a build that has two red rings and you have your tier seven already on both of them so the next

498
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:51,000
upgrade would be to get a two lp version right so now there is a chance to get that so

499
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
when you find that one lp red ring it doesn't just it's just it's not a dead item now you have a

500
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:03,000
chance to get like make an upgrade well two chances uh first here and then when it most likely fails

501
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
uh on the on the egg from the nemesis so i'm gonna expect some of these are gonna go to like

502
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:16,000
two lp and all of these are gonna go to zero uh well yeah here we go uh and as you can see

503
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:26,000
on the side here we have some crafting uh like uh affect shards and that is because you know weaver is

504
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
she doesn't want to take all of your things so when she takes away your legendary potential from

505
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:43,000
items she'll give you back some affect shards so all of these obviously went to zero lp as one would

506
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
expect uh most of these are probably going to be zero as well let's see if we get yeah there we go

507
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:57,000
two lp uh but most of these are zero which then allows you to then send them back to the nemesis egg

508
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,000
and you might get one lp back or you might get legendary affixes and whatnot so now we have

509
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,000
a method for these items that don't really do anything to have more chances to be useful right

510
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:21,000
uh and then another cool thing uh which was teased i think in the original trailer that people

511
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:29,000
thought was going to be this which was the unique uh re-roll uh so i can probably go set that up

512
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
actually uh real quick well i'll just stop my screen uh the frost or jet can probably talk a tiny

513
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:45,000
bit while i'm gonna do that yeah good we don't want to reveal any secrets it's pretty exciting

514
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:53,000
in the update we have uh 36 different unique woven echoes coming uh we just recorded the patch video uh i

515
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
recorded that and we're at the patch video just the high level overview of this patch is over 20

516
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
minutes long and i try to condense it as much as possible but it's just so dang much going into the

517
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
patch that uh it's very it's very very long in the patch i say there's 37 woven echoes and the team

518
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
called me out on it so i apologize there's 36 we'll get to 37 very shortly i promise you yeah just you know

519
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
slam in on the work for that one extra echo just put it in you know i agree i agree okay i'm ready again

520
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
are you ready all right go for it

521
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:40,000
okay so this is the thing that you saw teased uh in the very original teaser trailer uh which is has a

522
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:50,000
sacrifice and a reroll oh so this allows you to do i have another yeah so this allows you to sacrifice

523
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:02,000
a unique or set item uh or reverse reverse wheel item to reroll the the uh implicit so in here the

524
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
movement speed would be an implicit which or or already is uh the highest roll and then the the actual

525
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:16,000
affixes as well which also happen to be at max because this is a dev modded item uh and the cool

526
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,000
thing here is that the remember all of the all of the red rings that went to zero lp uh if i go to

527
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:32,000
the nemesis then they're most likely to get like some bad affixes so what you can do with those failed

528
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
legendaries is you could put them here uh like for example here i only have a well okay this is a very

529
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:44,000
bad example but i could imagine that the tier seven in here is like a tier four or something like

530
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:52,000
that so i could use this to reroll uh the values um here and obviously because this had everything

531
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:02,000
perfectly wrote before the stuff went down uh but this is a a way to basically those failed legendaries

532
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:10,000
uh to spend them and hopefully like over a longer period of time or just you know the first time

533
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,000
get lucky and improve your items so this is another way to slowly improve your items um and obviously

534
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:28,000
this has some restrictions so i cannot uh reroll one uh lp red ring with a zero lp it has to have at least

535
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:39,000
similar power level so in this case it would be uh badly rolled one like uh affix uh legendary red rings

536
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
most likely um got it but this is another again another way to keep like slowly upgrading your items

537
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:55,000
uh because we've had a lot of people ask for ways to you know be able to do something with uh

538
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
with the uniques because sometimes you get you know get lucky you get three lp or something like that

539
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:08,000
and then all of the other roles on it are terrible now through the nemesis egg which i think is probably

540
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:16,000
the best way to get uh like legendaries with like two affixes for something like like red rings like

541
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:23,000
the more rare items because it has a relatively high chance to just add affix on both of the rolls

542
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
like both of the upgrades and you can just use those as a reroll for whatever now which is pretty

543
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,000
exciting so all of those badly rolled legendaries now have a purpose

544
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
no that's great purpose yeah

545
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
and again here obviously you can open the stash through the uh the crafting window

546
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
it's we didn't just put stashes here um yeah you don't want to dirty up the place it looks beautiful

547
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:07,000
yeah there's actually another oh cool chains which is gonna be you know some magic is gonna happen um

548
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and this is specific to experimental crafting

549
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:21,000
uh a lot of people probably don't know much about it because it's really the hidden mechanic in the game

550
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:29,000
uh here we go i'll let you prepare really quickly yeah so where uh yeah so you find you kill exalt mages

551
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
uh and then they will kill you items or yeah or that yeah and they'll drop items with uh

552
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:45,000
with experimental affixes and then you use uh rune of research to seal that and then it has a chance to

553
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:54,000
drop you a clip of insight which then can can be used on a normal prefix to uh

554
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:02,000
uh turn it into an experimental affix and there is a deterministic way to figure out which

555
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
affix it turns into but that's it regards you to go to third party uh places because it's not you can

556
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
you can figure it out but there's a lot of just like trying to keep track of uh how much fortune

557
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,000
potential the item and what is the combined amount of tiers and different item bases uh have different

558
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:31,000
rules for it uh so we wanted to streamline that um and that rax rax has a great video on how to do

559
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:38,000
that if you want to do that in the next uh nine days yeah yeah so what what's happening is we are

560
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
removing uh both rune of research and cliff of insight entirely from the game uh and we are replacing

561
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,000
that crafting uh in a bow and echo and it's going to be a lot more straightforward there's obviously going

562
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:01,000
to be some randomization uh around this still uh it doesn't like guarantee you to remove a prefix

563
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
because it it has to remove a prefix in order to make uh room for another one uh we don't just let

564
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,000
you craft the uh the affix without without you know some some some sacrifice there

565
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:24,000
okay i think i'm finally done here i i applaud you man able to talk and do all this magic behind the

566
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:34,000
scenes i see your mouse hand moving like mad go for it oh goodness all right okay yeah so here i i just

567
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:43,000
run one of the bone echoes um that has the uh device that i'm not gonna try to pronounce

568
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
someone with better english can do that amateur amateur yeah thank you i had to look that up when

569
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
i was recording the patch but you say this yeah so what you do is you put either a boots gloves or belt

570
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:06,000
here and you can just pick the affix uh that you want to put onto your item now and there's a couple

571
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:17,000
things so it it has to have two prefixes and then it randomly replaces one of those prefixes and uh puts

572
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:26,000
the experimental ethics there not the bees or did i get kicked out uh this is uh this is uh

573
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:33,000
definitely not that's easier but uh one of the at least one of the uh experimental

574
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
affixes has been changed um so the experiment on beast one is now bees

575
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
there we go it took one of the affix out and it would be somewhere in a potion used there

576
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
because bees are awesome right oh yeah i think that was one of the first uniques i got i didn't

577
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
understand what was happening but i was annihilating everything in the first few acts and it was just

578
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,000
the bees you know it wasn't even a minion bill yeah the beekeepers gloves i think probably yep that's it

579
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:12,000
yeah yeah yeah yeah uh yeah so now it's a lot easier to uh get experimental affix to your items uh one

580
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,000
thing that obviously since we don't have rune of research anymore which was a guaranteed seal regardless of

581
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:31,000
tier on the experimental affix uh this i i think it can give you an exalted affix but the better way

582
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:39,000
here is to just simply use the rune of havoc right you have an item you have like a suffix exalt or

583
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
something like that you craft the experimental affix and then you just rune of havoc and hope that it's

584
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:51,000
hits the uh experimental affix so it's a lot easier like a lot easier and more streamlined to try to

585
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,000
get uh high tier experimental affixes on the correct item basis because item bases are very important

586
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,000
so very cool i i see a few quick questions on these in the chat can you seal this mod

587
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,000
yes uh with cliff of despair yeah you can you can still seal it but obviously that means that you

588
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:25,000
cannot seal uh higher than a tier four experimental affix anymore but so the absolute top end amount of

589
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,000
tiers of an experimental item has gone down but it comes with a trade-off of being able to actually

590
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:39,000
craft them on items that you want way more easily now very cool you might have another one now can you

591
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
put experimental items or experimental affixes on exalted items i think you may have mentioned that

592
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,000
you could they're wrong oh yes yes and that's that is that is how you're most likely going to be having

593
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:59,000
exalted experimental affixes because you you just craft the uh the lower tier like for example this is

594
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:08,000
your four so i could technically be able to cliff of despair this but the odds are pretty low but more

595
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,000
likely you'll have an exalted belt here instead and then you just use rune of havoc and then you

596
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,000
hope that it switches the the tiers to grant it on the uh experimental assets instead we

597
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:30,000
also there's a uh champion affix on this belt that i just not realized oh oh they're always yeah they are

598
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:38,000
always sealed um so those cannot be uh put onto uh legendaries either just like with uh set

599
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:48,000
set charts but these can drop naturally as exalted uh when you slay champions so that's pretty neat awesome

600
01:06:48,000 --> 01:07:00,000
this looks sweet yeah i think we might have one more oh there's one more yeah yeah and then you can

601
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
stand down yeah i'll go i'll go i'll go prepare that we'll take me all right you're gonna prepare that for

602
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,000
a sec all right sounds good sounds good let me stop watching yeah um one indicator that you're doing

603
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
well with itemization i think is when you run out of colors for affixes you know as a ui designer i'm

604
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
looking at these things thinking oh my goodness like the the next type we add what color is it

605
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,000
going to be that's what i'm stressing about yes yes yeah what is the best color you know we've been

606
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
trained to think certain things are the best but you know you gotta rethink that whole that whole

607
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
gossip you're going into the the diabla tour where it's like uh gold versus yellow and like it's just

608
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,000
tiny shade difference there okay here's a terrible idea don't take it change the font type for certain

609
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:49,000
affixes now okay there you go it's some wacky font in there you know uh they if you're running out of

610
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:55,000
colors go for that that'll that'll piss people off that's probably yeah we'd probably use iconography in

611
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:00,000
some capacity there when we run out of colors yeah yeah i don't know if everybody knows that but we

612
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:08,000
actually commissioned a uh uh uh what do you call them um a font foundry to create our custom last epoch

613
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
font and it was uh one of the guys who actually made the roboto font face that is very very popular

614
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
uh and that was that was a really big treat to both ross and myself because we both have a user

615
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
interface background so being able to create our own font for the game was just super super enjoyable

616
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,000
that's a good piece of trivia i saw maybe it was a meme but i saw that fonts are quite expensive

617
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
actually yeah yeah yeah yeah it was uh it was it was a decision that we had to make it wasn't just

618
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:47,000
like oh we're gonna do this no it was a decision uh last epoch font right off yes yes worth it worth

619
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
it absolutely yeah i don't know if you saw judd but people were saying you should just create that

620
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:58,000
extra woven echo as an echo full of meteors and you know you just gotta like somehow run to the other

621
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
side of the echo to complete it that's super easiest way to convince me of adding anything

622
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
into the game and the team knows it and they weaponize it against me if they ever want to add

623
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:13,000
something they're like well we'll have it like cast meteors and i'm like yes uh yeah we we did we did

624
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
have a couple of fun woven echoes that we did have to cut for scope reasons at the end there maybe

625
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:27,000
they will be reintroduced shortly who knows that's okay interesting okay i am i am i'm good to go again

626
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:37,000
all right go for it i don't remember did we did we tease this one did we reveal this yet um i don't

627
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
think on the uh well if we didn't then this is pretty this is pretty exciting for uh some people uh

628
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:53,000
so attributes or more specifically strength dexterity int and achievements now there's some builds

629
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:04,000
that would want to have int on certain item slots for example if you for some reason wanted to play a

630
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:17,000
primalist as a low health belt and you wanted to use exanguinance now class specific items such as the

631
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:25,000
send in the body armor here doesn't actually naturally drop with that intelligence so if you

632
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
wanted to farm for that the primalist build for example what you would most likely have to do because

633
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:37,000
there is small there's a bit of waiting on finding class specific items like if you're playing primalist

634
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
you're going to be finding primalist body armors relics and helmets more often than those places that

635
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:51,000
can actually roll with intelligence so to help out those monkey builds that people want to do

636
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:02,000
we have added a oh boy a way to swap the attribute between index strength and attunement

637
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:12,000
uh on items regardless that so we have the we have a nice tier 7 strength here you know what i wanted to be

638
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:22,000
int and now i have a tier 7 int on a send little body armor so but you can now make the item right it just

639
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:30,000
might delete the item yeah there's a chance that no no no all it does all it does it costs one fortune potential

640
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,000
to do it um obviously you cannot do this on like unique

641
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:46,000
affix and lingerie because they don't have fortune potential but this allows you to play on a build or

642
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:52,000
a class that cannot find specific uh attributes on their class specific items such as the helmet

643
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
and the body armor and then you can swap it to slam it onto your legendaries so

644
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
or you don't even need to you know slam them on the legendaries you can just if you want to

645
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:10,000
stack in thona send it and you can now do that with this on a base i'm i'm seeing some

646
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
technical person saying well what if the item has multiple stats on it are you just able to select

647
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:22,000
which stat it is pop it over and you yeah yeah look at that look at that qol you guys thought ahead

648
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,000
look at that that's sweet i'm i'm pretty sure we had the case where we we had the base and then we

649
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
tried it and then somebody had found an item with two two attributes and they're like wait a minute

650
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,000
and then we had to adjust rewind rewind this is one of those cases yeah yeah yeah oh that's good

651
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,000
well that is pretty cool there's a lot of stuff coming with the woven echoes you guys and i assume there's

652
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:57,000
there's a break we saw three break say again it seems ad break seems to be yeah going correct

653
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
oh an ad break oh dang okay can we stall for a few few yeah we can we can stall

654
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:14,000
i'll turn it into attunement in the meanwhile okay we did discuss adding a resistance swapper as well

655
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,000
uh uh i think it was it was it was it was divisive uh more so than the attributes that's what i remember

656
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
what are you guys uh starting on the 17th because you guys are going to log in right

657
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:42,000
any favorite class 100 percent i i'm so torn between heart seeker and either a piloting or

658
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,000
avoid night i can't i can't decide not having to stop to cast devouring orb sounds really fun

659
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:57,000
i really want to do that but i cannot i cannot do that over heart seeker yeah the uh the d2 bolazon is

660
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:05,000
is very deep on me as well yes yes yes you guys are drawing me with a sentinel yeah we're back okay they

661
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
didn't get to see what happens if there's two attributes you just get to choose the attribute

662
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:17,000
guys they were smart big shock ehg was smart everybody yeah and obviously all attributes

663
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:25,000
cannot be swapped because it's all attributes uh and vitality isn't valuable so there's a lot of reasons

664
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:34,000
for that but one being that it can already kind of roll everywhere uh and there's only like one or two

665
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:42,000
skills in the game that as a baseline scale with it uh so it's not like i don't say it's not a core

666
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:50,000
attribute but it's kind of not compared to the other four uh and we wouldn't be uh allowing you to get

667
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:58,000
vitality on basis that it wouldn't roll normally because that just puts more pressure onto your

668
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,000
previous as well because now your prefix can also provide you health through vitality so we don't

669
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:13,000
want to put too much uh pressure on there great all right well you just showed off three awesome woven

670
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
echoes no more spoilers for woven echoes that's the set the rest we can experience on game day

671
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:27,000
that seems we have a lot of good ones we have a lot of good ones for sure excellent okay all right

672
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:33,000
we're cutting you off sorry do you want to talk about quickly about the resistance i see he mentioned

673
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
the chat a couple times about the resistance weapon because we did discuss it uh but we didn't end up

674
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:46,000
uh allowing the resist swapping uh and then the main thing here is that we already have a very robust

675
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:53,000
very like a flexible crafting system there's a lot of different ways you can swap your uh your affixes

676
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:00,000
you have your rune removal you have your uh chaos so there's a way to seal off affixes to then make room

677
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:08,000
to craft stuff uh this is on the attribute specifically is a totally new way to create builds

678
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:16,000
that didn't really exist before uh versus resist fapping just makes it a lot easier to resist uh cap

679
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:24,000
your resistances which isn't really necessary due to the way our uh resistances work where enemies

680
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:31,000
penetrate some of your resistances which makes it a lot less deadly to not be address cap and then we also

681
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:38,000
have idols that are pretty flexible at providing resistances uh and the new weaver

682
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:45,000
um affixes also provide a decent amount of resistance you can see here and might be the first time

683
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,000
ever where you can get minion resistances too oh i don't think you really had minion physical resistances

684
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
like that there might be some very odd cases where you could provide them some resistances but yeah

685
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
minion players rejoice yeah

686
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:12,000
okay well i will take the magic away thank you carve that was beautiful

687
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
see yeah pleasure

688
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:23,000
okay we have a question right here it's kind of a philosophical question about itemization

689
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:29,000
uh in last epoch so how often do you expect players to be upgrading their items is it a goal to have

690
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
players find at least one or two gg items while leveling they'll end up using for a long time

691
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:41,000
or do you want players to be constantly churning uh and getting new item upgrades crafting different

692
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:49,000
affixes on them and the like yeah it's it's a good question um you know and it's different per

693
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
different stages of the game so for example like in your early game as you're going through the campaign

694
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
we of course want players to be exchanging their gear quite frequently and upgrading their gear quite

695
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
frequently um and you know that's healthy we want people to be experimenting with different skills

696
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,000
that they might enjoy they're unlocking their idle slots they're they're uh getting items that actually

697
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:14,000
go into their main uh slots and everything of that nature so in the early game it's very natural for

698
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
the amount of upgrades and the upgrading rate to be quite high uh that's healthy um when you get into

699
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
late game of course that slows down just a little bit uh but we do still want that frequency to be

700
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,000
at a decent pace because we don't want you to feel like you're hitting a gear plateau too early and

701
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
a lot of the things that we're adding with season two will help with that tremendously as you know

702
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
some of these things that we've been showing off uh show here um i think it's important that

703
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
even when you get into the late game uh there always feels like there is a significant

704
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
gap in power that you have versus what you could potentially obtain because when you get players to

705
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
you know maybe like an 80 maximum power threshold and your bill your build is online and you feel

706
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
like you kind of have what you uh want to have your bill at a complete state that's where players really

707
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,000
start to lose interest and so as long as you have things that you feel really excited to chase it can

708
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:12,000
keep the excitement and the enjoyability of the gear progression uh lasting for a lot longer than you

709
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
you know if you're plateauing early and that's one of the things that we're really focusing on with

710
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
the implementations that we have coming in season two um your question about do we want people to be

711
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:31,000
finding gg items in the uh i guess we'll kind of phrase it as the campaign experience um it's not

712
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
it's not necessarily a goal that we have i think if it were a goal we would probably pretty easily be

713
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
able to start to guarantee this to some extent which i believe would be actually very unhealthy

714
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
for the game you know the excitement of the game is the item chase and as soon as you start to

715
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
make it to where these things start to be guaranteed that starts to cheapen the experience overall and

716
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
that's not something that we want to do um now when you get into like the mid game say that you're

717
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:04,000
like level 40 plus it's very important that the potential to find a gg item exist uh because you always

718
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
want to feel like the next enemy that you're killing or the activity that you're participating in

719
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
has the chance to drop you something that's just going to really blow things out of the water and

720
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:19,000
make you feel way more powerful uh so i think it's it's important that the potential for that exist but

721
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,000
i think it's important also that we don't guarantee it uh when it comes to the campaign leveling

722
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:32,000
experience um instead of you know ensuring that the gg items or or making it very likely that gg items

723
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,000
drop that is something that our crafting system enables uh players to overcome challenges that

724
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:44,000
they would be facing in a much more uh directed manner uh so that's what we like to do to make

725
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
sure that you know there's not challenges presented at least in uh mid game or early late game that are

726
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:57,000
that are insurmountable yeah that's extremely sensible you know the only gg item i felt like i found

727
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
was the the beekeepers gauntlets when i was playing for the first time i mean i didn't replace those for

728
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
quite some time i couldn't get rid of them but yeah yeah it's a great feeling whenever you find

729
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
something like that and you're like heck this is this is awesome right this campaign experience is

730
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
going to be uh really unique because i found this thing and i'm really excited to have this but if we

731
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:22,000
were to guarantee that i think i think that you know that's that's not a good experience yeah totally

732
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:30,000
agree awesome thanks judd uh okay here's a fun one all right lots of games have items that

733
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:37,000
have huge downsides like they disable item slots they completely remove some vector scaling on your

734
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:44,000
build but they also come with tremendous upsides with you guys bringing in a lot of unique items

735
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,000
into the game with this patch with future patches and maybe set items in the future is that something

736
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:58,000
you might be looking into leaning into uh so uh i think it's fair to say we are keen on unique item

737
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
design that revolves around the problem solving aspect of balancing big downsides with powerful

738
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,000
upsides uh that just feels good when making a build it makes you feel smart when you're working around

739
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,000
those elements um you know we already have build enabling uniques with negative effects that you need to

740
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
work around uh for example zitharo's amulet which disables both health regen and leech uh for a more

741
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,000
multiplier for phase damage um i think it's fair to say though there that we don't have any uniques that

742
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,000
are truly wacky or iconic in that category you know where there are extreme downsides like you're talking

743
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:37,000
about like say disabling all of your idols and then a really game-breaking powerful benefit to offset that

744
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:45,000
um i think of the 25 new uniques in season two i don't think any of those rely around uh downsides

745
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:52,000
to work around um uh i can't say too much about it but in future seasons there may be more unique item

746
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:57,000
categories or systems that allow us to lean into more risky territory here um in terms of that design

747
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
space uh but you know a too early to share anything that on that at the moment unfortunately are those

748
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:07,000
the primeval items oh i'm going back to last year's is that what they're that that category

749
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:14,000
is called hey that was that was primordial i'm more oh i'm so upset at myself i was close okay

750
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:23,000
yeah well it's exciting me here there's a couple items in uh in the uh the season two that do have

751
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:29,000
a downside kind of stuff uh for example one of actually i'm thinking about four amulets there's

752
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
four amulets well one of them has like three different versions of it but all of those uh have

753
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:42,000
like downside of you have to curse yourself and then like to get a benefit and then there's a um

754
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:53,000
the the focus amulet that uh after some balancing during the uh the the ct testing and whatnot um

755
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
looks a bit different from what it was teased on the you know back in i don't know how long ago when

756
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:09,000
we just like showed a bunch of uh uniques on the original like season two uh teaser trailer uh so

757
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
you are like focus normally doesn't allow you to move while channeling so the amulet allows you to

758
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
move while channeling which is the big upside but then the downside is that uh you're gonna be

759
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
channeling you're getting less mana while you're doing that uh you're gonna have less armor while

760
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
doing that uh and then i think there's some probably another downside that i can't remember right now

761
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,000
but we do have these items but we don't have like like ross said we don't have like this crazy you know

762
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
nothing happened like you can't do anything if you have this item equipped i think the biggest

763
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:48,000
downside item that i can think of that doesn't really even have an upside would be the veteran boots

764
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:56,000
uh which is basically just a challenge item uh but yeah we don't we don't often make items that just

765
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:04,000
completely break your build like immediately or regard like absolute massive investment uh for it to

766
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:11,000
be good uh but a lot of the one of the uniques we do do change the way your uniques like you're sorry

767
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:18,000
not unique your skills work which then regards you to build them differently so yeah they're always exciting

768
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,000
i love having problems to to solve you know that's the i love that designing uniques you know so that

769
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,000
amulet sounds cool that's a new one you said the focus one yeah i can i can probably show it at some

770
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:37,000
point uh maybe maybe oh stall with one more question yeah there's there's probably something

771
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,000
other thing we want to show and i can oh okay well i have a great stalling question then okay i've seen

772
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:52,000
it spammed in the chat everybody is looking at carves shirt your hat judd real life merch store

773
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
when is this even a possibility in the future maybe associated with supporter packs which were actually

774
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,000
teased not released yet right just recently correct this is this coming maybe in the future

775
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,000
yeah yeah i i think the answer here is very likely yes uh it's something that really really

776
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,000
enjoy uh the team internally is always asking for additional merch for sure uh so it's something

777
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
that as the team grows in size and we're able to support the logistics of something like that i think

778
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,000
we're very keen as a studio to start to do that and if we do it will likely take shape in terms of

779
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,000
supporter packs um and you know t-shirts are kind of the bread and butter there but uh i would be really

780
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
interested to see if there's other cool unique physical type items that we could be creating

781
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
uh one one thing that i've had in mind and i this is not this is not happening this is not underway

782
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:48,000
so don't don't read into this too much uh but i really want a physical epoch and have you seen those

783
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:55,000
those little desk items that use uh use magnetism to float an item i really want one of those with a

784
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:02,000
little epoch artifact uh and and so uh if the dream comes true we'll have physical merch at some point

785
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
and maybe we can even have some some really cool uh items like that yeah

786
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
that sounds awesome gotta make the dream come true you guys we want our physical epochs

787
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
that's great absolutely we all we all want merch inside the company yes we do we do we do the uh

788
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,000
poor embroidery lady down the street you know we're still not like a a large operation in that manner

789
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
whatsoever so there's a little lady down the street that does our embroidery and we just give her so

790
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:34,000
much work just just for the team just for the team definitely all right carve did we stall long enough

791
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:41,000
with the merch question oh yes oh we did oh excellent okay i'm ready

792
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:58,000
go so first of all yeah we can take a look at the uh the i believe this has already been posted on on

793
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:06,000
reddit as a clarification because we had the old version in the like the mega thread so we have

794
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,000
shown this already i think this is actually the maximum roles you can get on the mana guide now

795
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,000
uh and this this basically turns focus into

796
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:22,000
you could say it's like a war path then because now you're channeling and things happened uh around

797
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:28,000
uh and this is this is a very this was very powerful in the original form like we had to nerf it

798
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:39,000
multiple times because how strong it was um but yeah that's it and then other things on the

799
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:48,000
teaser and somewhere else we might have uh shown cocooned items oh here we go yeah so cocooned uniques

800
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:58,000
uh i believe the only way to obtain these is just a it's a uh echo like objective uh so normally you're

801
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,000
one of your echo objectives like you know slay a champion or exalt mage oh yeah these are new ones uh

802
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:12,000
and then like the boss or complete uh like beacon and stuff like that so one of the new

803
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:23,000
new objectives is to slay enemies until you find these cocooned uniques and so when you try to put this on

804
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
it just reveals uh a random unique

805
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
and we're getting really lucky with just everything having uh lp it looks like

806
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:47,000
um damn wow these do have a slightly increased chance to roll lp oh yeah okay yeah i don't i don't

807
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:55,000
remember exactly how much but you are more likely to get lp on these um and yeah i can't wait to see

808
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:06,000
these uh you know reveal a full stash of cocooned items videos i'm ready oh there's some there's some

809
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
uniques here i see oh oh we got it we got to look at them yeah right i mean if they're they're rolling

810
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:20,000
it's like this looks like a new unique which was one of my mentioning where uh just stacking curses

811
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:30,000
helps and you can get curses on other masteries than being a warlock basically a lot of the uh

812
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,000
all of the curses and warlock basically regard you to be a warlock to get them uh because some of the

813
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:44,000
some things come skill trees or from the uh some skills so if if you are playing agolite but not a

814
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,000
uh warlock such as a necromancer for minions you can get some other cool curses for them

815
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:59,000
so yeah okay dude that that item art oh my gosh that's incredible oh yeah yeah yeah

816
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
there's a different there's a couple different versions i think there's a three different versions

817
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:13,000
of this uh oh so these yeah there's a bonkers inflix penance decryptify and then acid skin is the last one

818
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:20,000
of this is the last one so it's kind of cool uh and i think i think we uh might have mentioned

819
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:28,000
something about the weaver tree we might want to look oh yeah i mean go for it you need some time to

820
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:40,000
prepare no i can just just oh wow here we go okay yeah i can just open it um so yeah we have a lot of

821
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:48,000
cool customization and uh it might look like a small tree at first but most of these now just

822
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
have multiple points you can put in them uh so you can

823
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,000
did carp just freeze oh i think he did oh did you guys didn't shut him down did you

824
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
did you cut him off we pulled the plug on him we talked to hr we're like pull the plug he showed

825
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:14,000
too hard oh see he was unveiling everything i believe there's like here he is yep oh he's back and

826
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
since we are talking about itemization

827
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:28,000
carv can you go your back carve yes i can i can i can hear you okay you were away for about uh 20 30

828
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,000
seconds there oh he didn't you you had ended at like it looks like it's a small skilled uh small

829
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:42,000
tree okay okay multiple points yes most of these points you can put multiple points in them uh to

830
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:52,000
get higher benefits um of what the node provides like for example you have some loot lizard spawn rates

831
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:00,000
they come from caches you can get some more uh lizard tails and guaranteed you need kind of whenever you

832
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:10,000
you unburden loot lizards since we don't slay them have you help them um and uh since we are in an

833
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:17,000
itemized season discussion uh we might want to take a look uh or discuss some of these a bit so we have uh

834
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:26,000
we have these these cool nodes in the tree that allow you to imprint an item in there so for example

835
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:34,000
do i happen to have some some let's say let's say that for there so you can imprint these items um

836
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:43,000
into the weaver tree and then when you do specific things uh for example in this one um when you

837
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:52,000
when you get echo rewards you have a chance to get similar items to what you have imprinted here

838
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,000
for example it could provide bone amulets because that's the base it could provide uniques because

839
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:05,000
it's a unique uh in the cases of exalted items etc or like legendaries uh affixes that are there um

840
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,000
or a combination of them there's some limitations like for example you can't get boss specific uniques

841
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:20,000
like if you put uh the allies here or like one any of the uber uniques uh here they will not drop randomly

842
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:29,000
um i'm not sure if we currently are excluding them from here but uh it is explained here but so

843
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:42,000
these allow you to greatly enhance the ability to find uh not only the base types but also the item

844
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:49,000
type like the subtypes so not only not a ring but like a uh iron ring or or a silver ring for example

845
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:58,000
uh and uh i'd expect to see a lot of a lot of these imprints with some stuff like red rings and whatnot

846
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:08,000
in hopes of people getting getting those um and we have a so this is armor and jewelry uh then we have

847
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:16,000
one that is armor and weapon and then we have weapon and jewelry so you can't just put red ring on all of

848
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:23,000
them uh there's a we had a long discussions about how we want to do that or if you want to limit them

849
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:30,000
i think currently there isn't a node that would allow you to have uh an idol in here but that might

850
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:36,000
be something in the future we'll see uh and then this one on the top is a is an interesting one because

851
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:44,000
this is uh specific to slaying champions and the item that you have here uh has a chance to

852
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:55,000
drop the the item that comes out of it with one of the affixes as a sealed one so there's a some cool

853
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:01,000
potential stuff you can do here as well yeah worth noting that you're imprinting these items so you're

854
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,000
not losing the ability to equip them so if you've got your red ring you need to keep wearing it you

855
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:12,000
know it's it's imprinting it you're not losing it yeah as you can see uh oh okay let's take this

856
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:19,000
let's let's let's take this as an example uh for example here at the fang uh when i put it here it is

857
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:26,000
still here so you don't actually lose it so yeah it's just there which is cool and then you can uh

858
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:33,000
i think we revealed this already but you can uh imprint two woven echoes so if there's some

859
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:41,000
particular woven echoes that you really like you can imprint them um and then they will just spawn on

860
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:50,000
your echo web uh obviously more rare and rewarding ones have a lower chance but they are they're

861
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:58,000
pretty cool like uber aberrath you can put on here yes yes if you if you imprint two uber aberroth uh

862
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:06,000
known echoes here you are able to just randomly get uber aberroth hello in your web yes

863
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:13,000
well that's pretty i'd like to talk about the customization so a lot of things why i really

864
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:22,000
like this is you can do things like um you can you can convert some of the rewards like for example

865
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:31,000
this one um the cliff is no longer a reward it's not something else instead

866
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:37,000
uh then we have the obvious no longer getting arena echoes which is cool

867
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:46,000
there's a lot of interesting things here oh we're getting ads again it looks like

868
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,000
getting ads again oh okay yeah yeah stall for a sec spam i yeah dang i ran as many ads as possible

869
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:00,000
everybody i'll wait i'll wait to ask my next question then uh about this um

870
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
judd what games are you playing on your oculus you know i haven't touched that thing in a long

871
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:15,000
time no way no i haven't i haven't uh i have a an oculus 2 and that's the three and when i use those

872
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:22,000
i usually go into this app called wander which is basically like google maps but you can do it in vr

873
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:28,000
and so you can just like go anywhere in the world um it came with a it came with a specific game that was

874
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:35,000
cool it was a good dungeon hack and slash type game with some level of itemization um i have never

875
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:44,000
been so sick in my life i i like had to lay down i was so physically ill after playing that game

876
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:51,000
i want so badly to be able to enjoy those things but um yeah it's uh you get your vr legs after a

877
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,000
while apparently right right yeah eventually the tech will be there okay we're back thank thank you chat

878
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,000
we just stalled talking about vr for a second sorry car if the ads interrupted us let's go yeah

879
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,000
it's fine but yeah so one of the reasons i've well many of the reasons i'm very excited about

880
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:17,000
your trees being able to not only customize what content you get but also what you get out of the

881
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,000
you know just your normal everyday uh echoes because they still exist there

882
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:29,000
um so for example you can entirely remove all the group cliff rewards and it just gives you something

883
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:34,000
else instead and then you can do the same for arena keys and then you can do the same for experience

884
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:43,000
and then you can say the runes and suddenly you'll have a lot less uh possible rewards that most people

885
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:51,000
think are bad and we also have some new ones oh so if you want to like blast experience you could just

886
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:56,000
narrow everything down and like make experience one of the only rewards you can get yeah i don't

887
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:02,000
think you can quite remove everything everything you can you can you can increase uh the stuff you get

888
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:09,000
a decent amount and then memory amber you know the sink on your idols farming your you know perfect idols

889
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:18,000
and uh all that so you can now have a memory amber as a reward for completing echoes if you take this

890
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:24,000
yes uh and i think there's another one for bowen echoes as well and then i believe there's one

891
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:33,000
specific for dungeon keys yeah here so we have the one that provides just keys which can be dungeon

892
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,000
keys but this one is specific to dungeon keys can we talk about portal charms

893
01:40:38,000 --> 01:41:06,000
yeah i mean yeah this can also give you those uh yeah we uh we're implementing portal charms and one of the ones that we think that people are really going to enjoy is uh it's a charm that you insert into the dungeon that allow you to portal uh directly to the boss of the dungeon and we're implementing a uh black market key trader in upper majelka and you can trade uh any three dungeon keys for a portal charm so uh people that have a whole lot of excessive

894
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:14,000
a lot of excessive dungeon keys will be uh lucky to go in and trade those things and uh be able to portal directly to the bosses

895
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,000
that's sweet infinite boss gauntlet just go in and blast the boss people love that

896
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:32,000
yeah there's a there's a lot of notes we could uh go over but i'm not sure if we have time or we want to do that is there any notes we should take a look at

897
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
anything you guys

898
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
let's kill nemesis notes carf

899
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:45,000
i think they are yeah here huh so yeah we got oh i like that highlight function i i just got to shout you guys

900
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:52,000
out that's very clear yeah so obviously just get more nemesis you want nemesis you can get more nemesis uh

901
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:59,000
there's i think two woe one echoes that have something to do with nemesis at least one that allows you

902
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
lets you farm them a bit more as well um

903
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:11,000
oh yeah nemesis escapes through a portal after being apart you know you get some uh this is specific to the

904
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:21,000
uh the nemesis uh weapon types like weapon bases that when you kill a harbinger it upgrades so

905
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
uh this was something that was quite hard to farm

906
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,000
previously because there weren't the only way to get the uh nemesis specific

907
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:40,000
weapons was by just getting them from nemesis so you had to banish them a lot to find hopefully get the correct base and then on top of that you

908
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
really needed to get lucky to get the good stuff on them as well so this is going to help you farm

909
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:52,000
the nemesis spaces if your build wants to use those um there's one scepter especially which is really

910
01:42:52,000 --> 01:43:02,000
strong uh the base grid scepter uh and then um you can put them into your uh two cemeteries as well

911
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:10,000
the nemesis that is if you put three points here it's guaranteed that the uh two human cemeteries are

912
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:19,000
gonna have uh a nemesis that is possessed which makes it stronger one of my favorite woven echoes

913
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,000
is the uh nemesis tower where you're climbing the tower and you have back-to-back nemesis uh people

914
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
are people are really going to enjoy that one because you get to you know see the evolution of the items

915
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
very rapidly

916
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:40,000
my favorite by far just the abusul trap where shade just pops into your echo and uh wants to have a

917
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:48,000
chat that's cool yeah as i mentioned earlier on like the one of the one of the reasons we added

918
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
system like this is to you know ensure that when we're adding new seasonal mechanics that you know

919
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
we've got we've got a method they are ready to modify and interact with that um so that's that's

920
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,000
going to help us in the long term as well and do you think when you add a new seasonal mechanic you

921
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:09,000
might immediately add it to the weaver tree or will you wait to see if the community enjoys it and then

922
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:15,000
add it post season if it ends up staying in the game yeah i think um at the moment anything we're

923
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
adding a seasonally is added to the base game you know i don't think we're at a point where you know

924
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
we wouldn't add a system like nemesis and then take it away because it's too like it's too valuable the

925
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:30,000
the game needs more of those random encounters at a certain point that would be the case tried like

926
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,000
you know but we're we're probably uh a wee bit far out from doing that at the moment

927
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:44,000
nice now that i was on a shade i got another thing i wanted to really mention is uh and this is

928
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:53,000
pretty really relevant for items so farming items from shade uh when we added the

929
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:59,000
the the the or when we buffed the corruption catch up so if you have a one timeline at a very high

930
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:04,000
corruption and then you want to farm shade like a you know lower corruption because it's faster or

931
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:12,000
whatever safer um what ended up happening is your timeline went up in corruption because you killed shade

932
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:18,000
through the the corruption catch up and then what you had to do is you had to do the the echo in the

933
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:26,000
middle at the start to lower the corruption again and then go farm another shade and it was just really

934
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:31,000
tedious annoying little thing that we just we totally missed on that because we wanted to buff the

935
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:37,000
corruption catch up and there were people who wanted to farm shade at a very specific lower corruption than

936
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:45,000
their highest is so now if you take this node you can farm shade in that specific corruption and it

937
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:51,000
doesn't increase the corruption anymore with the catch up mechanic so any shade farmers who want to

938
01:45:51,000 --> 01:46:03,000
do very specific corruption uh here's a node for you player agency gotta love it yeah a lot of good stuff

939
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:09,000
in here yeah there there is something maybe trivial popped into my head judd when you talked about climbing

940
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:16,000
the tower with the nemesis yeah are all of these woven echoes new environments like new maps i i know

941
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:22,000
that might seem like little i i'm just a big fan of new places and i saw one that looked like it was on

942
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:28,000
an like an island in the middle of the ocean or and some monster was swimming around are these all new or

943
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:30,000
a mix

944
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,000
i think the vast majority of them are brand new yeah oh the vast majority yeah the vast majority of them brand

945
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:44,000
new some of them are like that's been and also also in the sense of maybe using the ancient era um

946
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:49,000
which is you know uh more to come there um but yeah the you know i think their original plan um was

947
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:56,000
maybe to have more and reuse existing echo layouts however however um you know that didn't seem right to

948
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
do at the same time as adding potential generation things like that so yeah we we did put a bit more

949
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:07,000
effort into have them feeling much more unique i love that there's a couple very unique style

950
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:14,000
woven echoes that yeah and we we wanted to there's a there's a we had a lot of ideas for a lot of

951
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:23,000
different totally different mechanics and whatnot uh but i i'd expect some of those to come in the future

952
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:30,000
hopefully exciting because we obviously needed to get all of the the mode that the must-have kind of

953
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,000
of thing like all of the the new itemization related woven echoes and then just all the cool bosses and

954
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,000
and and what right but we have we have a couple really cool fun months there but yeah i think uh

955
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:49,000
it's time for me to take off the the the streaming again so you can see our uh there you go there we go

956
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,000
all right you guys that that was beautiful the weaver tree now before i i get to my final question for

957
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:03,000
all of you is there anything else you guys would like to show for tombs of the erased anything else

958
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:12,000
i think i think likewise the uh picking up crafting materials and having those automatically be sent to

959
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
your crafting panel is just one of my favorite things coming with this patch as somebody who plays

960
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:23,000
on gamepad um people people on on keyboard and mouse will also benefit greatly from that that's a very

961
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:28,000
very very good update and then the uh inventory tabs being able to have keys and woven echoes and

962
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
your items be stored in different inventory tabs is a really good quality of life thing definitely

963
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
all right yeah if you're a veteran player as well um your monolith progression through normal timelines

964
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,000
is shared with characters that have access to that stash so it's less of a slog to get through the

965
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
monolith you know if you know what you're doing on your alt characters you've already gear for them

966
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
um and you know you know how to play the game you'll be able to test more builds out very fast enough

967
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:00,000
did we mention that um you will be able to use keys to respawn in dungeons either at the floor

968
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:08,000
that you were on or at the boss oh i didn't know you know i have yeah yes that's uh that's a good one

969
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:15,000
that's a good one for all those people dying to that girl i can't her name is escaping me the chronomancer

970
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:23,000
girl jora yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah uh now again on hardcore don't do that uh it's not going to save

971
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:31,000
you it's not going to save you uh but for our soft core players it's helpful yeah all right we got some

972
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,000
other cool cool things coming in as well that we haven't revealed yet i think i mean it's going to be an

973
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:42,000
exciting day you guys and i think i think we all know you know there's going to be a lot of new

974
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,000
and returning players flocking to last epoch for this massive update you guys had i think it's nine

975
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:56,000
months to cook and you guys cooked a feast okay do you have any message to all these people that are

976
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:02,000
going to be trying out last epoch when it drops april 17th like what is your advice from you three

977
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:10,000
you're logging into le the first time character select you load in what do you tell them yeah i

978
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,000
think for me i've got a very specific way of playing rpgs where um you know a lot of people

979
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:20,000
recommend that you play last epoch um without a build guide just play yourself learn the game that

980
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
way and i think that's i think that's the that's the correct way to do it i like to hedge my bets though

981
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,000
in general i look up build gains and look up a you know skills being used to understand if i would

982
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
like to play that type of content and then i'll bookmark that guide but i won't use it

983
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
uh and then i'll proceed through the game myself and if things work out i make the same decisions

984
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:45,000
uh as that you know as the build build creator and i get to feel smarter about that or if i'm struggling

985
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,000
i get something to fall back on and i think for me that's that's the way to do it because you get to

986
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
feel smart if you make the right decisions there but you've also got a backup plan if things aren't

987
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:59,000
going so well and you're having trouble scaling into impaired models yeah piggybacking off that um

988
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:04,000
yeah getting in there and just following the fun with the skill system and the crafting system that

989
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
we have you should be able to go in there and make a build that will at least be able to get through

990
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,000
the campaign and if you end up finding that you're in a challenging position and you're just not

991
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:18,000
powerful enough to get past a certain uh progression point you can open the crafting panel and add some

992
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:25,000
add some shards to gear it's a very easy way to go and and uh get to the campaign without uh having to

993
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,000
follow a build guide or anything of that nature um also just in case people aren't aware we have

994
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:36,000
this really robust in-game guide press g to open that up it's got an absolute wealth of knowledge

995
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
and everything that you'll need to know to be successful uh in in the game uh so again yep

996
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
don't feel like you need to follow a build guide i will say that there are a lot of really fantastic

997
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
creators that put a lot of love and effort into making build guides that are really enjoyable and

998
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:55,000
really good uh really easy to follow so it's great if you do like to do that there's a lot of great

999
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:04,000
uh creators that you can go and support in that way as well my two things would be to go watch

1000
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:12,000
a streamer because there's twitch drops oh big some some some cool mtx and then the other one would be to

1001
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:21,000
keep your chat open to you know really like live the uh through the the all the fun and hype and

1002
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:27,000
everything that people are chatting on the uh and helping each other and uh even if you are an offline

1003
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:34,000
player instead of going full offline mode you could go just through offline while having a chat to uh be

1004
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:40,000
able to uh chat with people while playing to you know not feel so alone even though there's a lot of

1005
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:46,000
people who like to play alone but uh i especially like to just chat with people like i'm gonna be
