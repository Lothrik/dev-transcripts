We are fundamentally changing how you engage with items, how you upgrade them, and along

682
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
the way, solving a lot of things that we've seen continually from our community, we agree

683
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
with our pain points of our existing item system right now.

684
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So in this new itemization system, we're focusing on narrowing down the scope of the base

685
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
affixes.

686
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They're going to be a lot simpler, they're going to be fewer in number, so you can much

687
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
more easily parse whether this item is useful for you, and if it is, then you can take it

688
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and further upgrade it and customize it to your own specific build.

689
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Tempering is a new system that allows you to really customize the gear that you find.

690
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
In order to temper, you will need to go to the blacksmith and then choose the recipe that

691
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
you wish temper from, and then a random affix from that recipe will be attached onto your

692
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
gear.

693
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
These recipes can be found from almost all of the content throughout sanctuaries.

694
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So you will actually be looking for tempering recipes that go directly with what you're

695
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
envisioning, maybe you're thinking, I'm going to play a frost sorceress.

696
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
There are also going to be recipes that are more generic and maybe are just generally

697
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
good for the sorceress, but you'll be able to choose which one you think is going to be

698
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
most powerful with the build you're making for your class.

699
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You're making a pretty radical change to the codex of power in this season based again

700
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
on the feedback that has been coming from our players.

701
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Now every single legendary in the game will be entered into your codex of power so that

702
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
you can continually imprint the best possible version of that legendary onto your gear.

703
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So going forward, there will no longer be carrying around all of these aspect crystals

704
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
in your inventory.

705
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's all going to be in the codex of power.

706
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So part of the final system that we have is going to be greater affixes.

707
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Well, it's a greater affix.

708
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Well we want to keep it compelling that there are some drops that are even better than

709
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
the others when you're trying to get the perfect build at endgame.

710
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Because of this in World Tier 4 and only in World Tier 4, when an ancestral legendary item

711
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
drops, there's a chance the affixes on it can roll as greater affixes.

712
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
These will roll with bigger values that are normally available for that affix.

713
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Greater affixes are fairly rare, but they're not impossible to find.

714
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
While leveling up, you're going to be able to find upgrades much more easily with this

715
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
new system.

716
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Another part of itemization is going to be master working.

717
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Now this is something really intended for that very high endgame, again, World Tier 4.

718
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
This is where a player is going to take an item.

719
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
He has the affixes that they won on it, but now they go through a process of upgrading

720
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
those affixes, getting even higher values on them.

721
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Master working really starts at level 100.

722
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Once you've already completed your build and found some of the best items, you're going

723
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
to be able to test your build against the powerful enemies of the pit.

724
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The pit is a new endgame system that has been added in this season that is going to challenge

725
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
players that feel that they have largely maximized their build.

726
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
By pushing into more difficult tiers of the pit, you're going to be able to unlock

727
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
rare crafting materials to master work your gear even further.

728
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You're going to have to play some of the hardest content in the game, but once you do,

729
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:28,000
if you're successful, you can go and make those affixes even stronger.

730
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
In season 4, we're ramping the intensity of the health tides through the inclusion of

731
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
a variety of new activities, the first of which is a doubling down and rise of the cultist's

732
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
presence throughout the tide.

733
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
We're going to be running through the health tides, saying the cultist is conjuring

734
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
up swarms and swarms of demons, adding to that sense of manic and chaos that they're

735
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
pretty well known for.

736
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
The other archetype that we're adding is the presence of the Doomsayers, who were unfortunate

737
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
enough to be caught out into tide and basically just lost their minds to all of the mania going

738
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
on around them.

739
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And lastly, rounding out the new activities are just the inclusion of the iron wolves.

740
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They're finally joined the fight.

741
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It could no longer stand in the sidelines, seeing the health tides and the health forces

742
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
intensify their assault on sanctuary.

743
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
As season 4 players engage and progress through the cult of the wolves, seasonal activity,

744
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
they'll earn honor with the iron wolves, unlocking access to a vast assortment of rewards to

745
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
accompany and empower your season 4 journeys.

746
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
In the updated health tide for players who are able to stay alive long enough, they'll

747
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
be paid a visit by the Hellborne.

748
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Former heroes of sanctuary who have aligned with the forces of Hell to attack the allies

749
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
they once aligned with.

750
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Players who are able to take down the Hellborne will be acquiring the materials they need

751
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
to engage with the new premier Haltide activity, the accursed rituals.

752
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Located in the Haltide, these accursed rituals are pretty much just botched rituals from the

753
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
cultist that players will be kickstarting for themselves, drawing the intention of all

754
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
the nearby Haltide monsters in this kind of all-out battle.

755
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
One of my favorite themes for these ambushes is the Hellworm.

756
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's literally a giant hell slug beast that emerges from the ground, but it spews out a

757
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
whole bunch of mobs at you.

758
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
If you're able to survive that, you'll be paid a visit from the Blood Maiden, our brand

759
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
new Haltide mini-boss and one of the ultimate challenges in the new experience.

760
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So I think I'm actually most excited about this season because of what you're able to

761
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
do with your old characters, how they can integrate with this new item game and take

762
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
them to new levels of power with this system.

763
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I think that the best part of this update is that you're going to be really empowered

764
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to build the character that you want to play.

765
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You're going to be able to pick custom affixes and enhance your character in a lot of new

766
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and interesting ways.

767
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Happy Friday Diablo Community.

768
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Welcome to another Diablo IV, Campfire Chat.

769
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I am Adam Fletcher.

770
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm joined here by a very familiar face, Mr. Adam Jackson.

771
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Hello, hello.

772
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The atoms have invaded.

773
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
We've taken over.

774
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
We have taken over.

775
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
We actually are joined by one additional person and this person is tuning in, patching in.

776
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I don't know what they're phoning in.

777
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't know.

778
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
From Albany, Blizzard Albany.

779
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That's Mr. Dan Tangue.

780
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Dan, would you like to introduce yourself?

781
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, sure thing.

782
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Hi, I'm Dan Tangue and I'm one of the lead seasons designers for Diablo IV and we've

783
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
got a lot of exciting stuff to share with you.

784
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Awesome.

785
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Great to hear from Dan.

786
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Dan is kind of like melting in Albany.

787
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I believe it's very, very warm up.

788
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It's actually warmer there than California, which is kind of crazy.

789
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It is.

790
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Look at this.

791
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Adam and Adam.

792
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Ooh, I love it.

793
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We did it.

794
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
No more Joes.

795
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Jo is where is Jo by four, not here.

796
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
He's actually on vacation.

797
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's the reason why he's not here.

798
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We have a lot to talk about today.

799
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We are actually going to be talking about season five in the PTR and we do want to, there's

800
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
been a lot going on with Diablo IV over the last couple of months.

801
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Obviously season four is launched.

802
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We had our midseason update last week.

803
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We introduced pets, which is really cool.

804
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Adam, would you say that?

805
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
No one expected it, but we did introduce pets within season four.

806
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And at the same time, we also had our release state announcement for Vessel of Hatred, which

807
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
is October 8th.

808
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So lots and lots and lots of cool stuff that's going on with Diablo IV.

809
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And we have more to share today, but of course with PTR, we do need to talk a little bit

810
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
of the housekeeping stuff to make sure that players are aware of it and when it's going

811
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
to start.

812
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
We have season five PTR actually starting next Tuesday and that is on the 25th.

813
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It will run for one week similar to the season four PTR.

814
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It is PC Battlenet only again.

815
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It is just easier for us to be able to get builds up and get things out and get feedback

816
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
in really quickly when we have it on PC Battlenet.

817
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So that will be going live next Tuesday.

818
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Everything that we're talking about today will be in a blog that will go live after the

819
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
stream.

820
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And as well as patch notes will be going live after the stream and they're pretty beefy

821
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and themselves are in it.

822
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I don't know.

823
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's Friday, you guys.

824
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So we haven't done a Friday stream in a while.

825
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's been a long while.

826
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
For feedback though, we will be opening up our PTR forums for players to actually be able

827
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
to submit feedback.

828
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So the Diablo IV forums will have a special section for PTR.

829
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And then separately, if you do want to leave feedback on other avenues such as Reddit

830
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
or the community sanctuary discord, places like that, we most definitely end up combing

831
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
through all the various ways of players being able to provide feedback specifically from

832
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
that end.

833
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
For this PTR, we will note that this one will be a little different than season four in

834
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
regards to how you can start off characters.

835
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
There will still be character boosts like what we had with the season four PTR.

836
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I believe it's actually moved to a different city.

837
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I can't recall.

838
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I think we had it in Kyovashod before and I believe it's in a different city and I don't

839
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
recall which city it is.

840
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's in the blog though.

841
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But all that information will be there after the stream.

842
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Separately, we did incorporate a character copy feature, but we initiated this character

843
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
copy already.

844
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
No one knows this, but as of yesterday, characters were copied from your accounts over to PTR.

845
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So it gives you a little bit of a variety of being able to take over some of those characters

846
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that you've already built out.

847
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Or if you want to, you can still use the character boost.

848
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I will note, we do want players to be experiencing in a variety of ways like whether using your

849
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
current characters that we're copying over or if you're using some of the character

850
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
boosts, we do recommend, or if you want to level up, level one too.

851
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That's another option as well.

852
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It allows us to get feedback from all different aspects.

853
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So we do recommend trying it out in different ways and providing feedback of how things

854
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
feel, how things flow within the PTR itself.

855
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So that is all the general housekeeping notes that we do have.

856
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Oh, and I will say that I believe we actually did correct that codec's a power reset thing

857
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
as well.

858
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yeah, I remember that was that was a plaguing some people last season.

859
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We did correct that.

860
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So I won't reset.

861
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I believe every single time you end up like creating a new character or boosting a new

862
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
character, I believe.

863
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And then separately on the forums, we will have a known issues list because they're, you

864
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
know, it's PTR.

865
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
It's an early build.

866
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So we want to make sure that people are aware of that.

867
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And with PTR, you know, when we take in feedback, it's great for players to be able to

868
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
like write all various forms of feedback.

869
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I will say by the time season five launches, we will try our best to get as much of that

870
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
feedback in.

871
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
If it's something that's like a massive like, oh, like a huge overhaul or something like

872
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
that, I wouldn't expect it in season five, but it is good to hear that feedback because

873
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
it might be something that we end up incorporating maybe in the future for like a future season

874
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
from that end.

875
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah, it's very useful.

876
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So that helps us drive future decisions and even we did a lot of reaction to PTR feedback

877
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
in season four.

878
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I remember right.

879
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
We did like a whole lot on our team at least and I expect the same for season five.

880
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Exactly.

881
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It's send it in.

882
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's very useful.

883
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And then one last thing I do want to note is because players have probably seen when

884
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
season four is ending, which is currently in early August, you can see that kind of like

885
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
on your character select screen when you're jumping into the game.

886
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I will note that season five is a little bit shorter of a season than what we've had

887
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
beforehand.

888
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Season five itself will run until that October 8th date with Vessel of Hatred because Vessel

889
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
of Hatred is actually the start of season six.

890
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So we did want to at least clarify, make sure because we've heard a lot of those questions

891
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
of like, hey, is like, is Vessel of Hatred hitting the middle of season five, things like

892
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
that.

893
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So we did want to note that from that end.

894
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And now for the housekeeping notes, I know a lot of players want to hear about season

895
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
five in itself.

896
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And so Mr. Dan Tangway from the sweltering city that made some of the Albany will be

897
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
walking us through season five.

898
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, absolutely.

899
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So yeah, let's dive into the new features on PTR for season five.

900
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Just to give you a little bit of context, you know, we did some early brainstorming

901
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
for season five and we knew that, you know, we needed to build out the end game.

902
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So end game, you know, we've heard y'all that end game is very important.

903
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And season four, we added the pit into the end game and some people have been playing

904
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
a helltides into the end game, but we still want to expand the end game a bit more, right?

905
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So if it's an end game activity, we definitely need something that's for awarding and very

906
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
replayable.

907
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We also wanted to make something with a lot of monsters.

908
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I mean, monster density and just entering that feeling of flow states really important

909
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
for players.

910
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
We needed something that had stakes and we wanted players to push their luck.

911
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And finally, we really wanted to return to hell, you know, previous Diablo games let

912
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
you return to hell after you defeat the big boss, but Diablo four hadn't done that yet.

913
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And so with all those goals in mind, let me introduce you to the infernal awards.

914
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Now, let me give you a quick summary of what the infernal hordes is.

915
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's a wave-based gameplay mode with survivor-like choices in between the waves and it'll

916
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
culminate with an all new boss encounter.

917
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And then the rewards build on top of itemization 2.0 that came in season four.

918
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So now how do you go about confronting the internal hordes?

919
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
How do you get back to hell?

920
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I think we can queue up some footage and then I'll talk you through some of the ways you

921
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
get back to hell.

922
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
All right, first off, you're going to unlock, you know, the activity for hell with a

923
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
brisk eternal quest line starting at World Tier 3 in Zarbonzett.

924
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That's where you need to go in the PTR.

925
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Now, you need a new type of key called a compass, which you can see down in the inventory

926
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
below here.

927
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And like Nightmare Dungeons, the compasses all have a starting monster difficulty and a

928
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
number of revives.

929
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And there are eight levels of difficulty with escalating challenge and rewards.

930
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You can see it's a very Nightmare Dungeon-like flow here.

931
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And then compasses can be upgraded to higher tiers with all new consumables called Abyssal

932
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Scrolls.

933
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So you'll get a chance to play with all these new features when you're in the PTR.

934
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But let's really talk about the gameplay itself.

935
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And I think we've got some footage of the wave-based play that we can show off here.

936
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
First off, going to have a lot of monsters.

937
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Now you have one monster here.

938
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This is the start of wave 1.

939
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And so you defeat this Aether Fiend.

940
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And it's going to drop something called Burning Aether, which is a new currency.

941
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
This new currency is specific to health.

942
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And you use it to unlock the spoils of hell at the end of a run.

943
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And at the end of each wave, there's going to be what's called the infernal offer.

944
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So let's get through this wave and we'll take a look at the infernal offer.

945
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Now you see these hands reaching out from hell itself.

946
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And they're tempting you with a choice.

947
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You're going to choose the form of your destructor.

948
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You're going to pick a boon and a bane that impacts the rest of your run.

949
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And so now you've chosen a boon and a bane.

950
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And that's going to modify the gameplay that comes up next.

951
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And so here, you're jumping into one of the new activities that also unlocks Aether in

952
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
this.

953
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And this is a soul spire.

954
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's pretty similar to a hell spire that you'd see in Hell Tide.

955
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And you have to kill a number of enemies within that ring in order to be able to earn an

956
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Aether.

957
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And you can upgrade soul spires from the infernal offer as well, if you like.

958
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And then finally, what you need to do is complete the number of waves in order to be able

959
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
to confront the boss.

960
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And so you see in this particular run, you're at five of five waves.

961
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
So you are just about ready once you defeat this wave to go confront the new bosses for

962
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
the infernal hordes.

963
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So we'll finish collecting our Aether here.

964
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And our last number of enemies.

965
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And I think we're good.

966
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I think we're ready to go.

967
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So let's take a look at our new bosses.

968
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I think we've got some cool art to share here.

969
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So these are the fell council.

970
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
They're going to be some familiar faces for Diablo 2 players.

971
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
They are resurrected versions of the council members from Diablo 2.

972
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
For those of you who didn't play Diablo 2, the council members were former high priest

973
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
of the Zachary room.

974
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And they had promised to basically take care of Mephisto after he'd been trapped in the

975
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
soul stone.

976
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And he'd been hidden down and harassed and tribuncle.

977
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And of course, as it happens, Mephisto corrupted them both in mind first and then their bodies.

978
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And they became demons who are just zealous and serve him without question.

979
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And so we thought it was going to be really cool to be able to resurrect them and bring

980
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
them back for Diablo 4 and they fit great in hell.

981
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
We had to tweak their power sets a little bit to fit the D4 combat system.

982
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So we gave them new titles and new looks to really reflect their combat specialties.

983
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's incredibly awesome to see these guys come back.

984
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
It's giving very nostalgic vibes of doing a bunch of, you know,

985
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Durance of Hate runs for Mephisto and doing Meph runs and everything like that.

986
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So it's really awesome to see them back in season 5.

987
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah, I agree.

988
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Diablo 2 is certainly near and dear to our hearts here out in New York.

989
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And yeah, we're really glad to have them back and we hope to see hopefully more returning

990
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
new faces in the future too.

991
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So let's take a look at that boss encounter now.

992
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So I showed you a number of members of the Fell Council here.

993
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
We've actually built five of them in total.

994
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But you're only going to fight three at a time.

995
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Now we keep two in the hopper basically and we do that because we want to have a whole

996
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
bunch of replay associated with this boss fight.

997
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And because we're only using three of the five, there's actually ten variations of this

998
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
boss fight.

999
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You can fight randomly as you do your infernal run.

1000
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And so we're going to basically kill them off.

1001
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And once you defeat one, the fight will actually escalate.

1002
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Actually probably escalates even if you just take down a certain amount of health, if I

1003
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
remember correctly.

1004
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And it escalates basically their attacks become more powerful.

1005
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And then they start really getting even more powerful kind of room clearing attacks towards

1006
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
the end.

1007
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But we've defeated them here.

1008
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And this is the reward moment I actually wanted to talk through with you because this is

1009
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
something that really ties in the itemization 2.0.

1010
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You've got several chests here.

1011
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And you've got a choice of the rewards you get at the end of your infernal run.

1012
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
You can choose from a chest that contains all new legendaries and new uniques.

1013
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You can choose from a chest that contains all sorts of crafting materials including master

1014
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
working materials.

1015
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So you don't need to go to the pit any more exclusively to get master working materials.

1016
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You've got a chest that allows you just to get a whole bunch of gold.

1017
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I know people out there are really asking for gold and this is going to be a good source

1018
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
of it.

1019
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And finally, even though it wasn't shown here, you have a chest that guarantees a single

1020
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
item with a greater effects on it.

1021
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And so we thought we'd want to try this out and see how people respond to it.

1022
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And we thought it would be pretty exciting, certainly, in season 4.

1023
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm really trying to get some more greater effects.

1024
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So I'd love to have this in season 5.

1025
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So yeah, let's take a closer look at some of the uniques you can farm from the infernal

1026
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
run.

1027
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Since we're talking about rewards already.

1028
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So we're going to queue up some footage here.

1029
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So first up, we've got the basilisk.

1030
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And so this is going to be a new unique staff for druids.

1031
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
And so when you hit an enemy with a nerf skill, it'll petrify them and deal physical damage.

1032
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So turning the monsters to stone, always cool.

1033
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But it's also cool that you can see see your target and boost your initial attack here.

1034
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So this one's pretty exciting for your druid players out there.

1035
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
All right, next up, we've got the third blade.

1036
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Now, this is a unique sword for barbarians.

1037
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
This one makes your weapon mastery skills be treated as core skills that cost fury.

1038
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Even though they deal a little reduced damage, this one's pretty exciting because now you

1039
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
can start making all sorts of new builds that you've never seen before.

1040
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So we're really interested to see what the community comes up with here.

1041
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
All right, next up, we've got the morta crux.

1042
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Now, the morta crux is a new unique dagger for Necro.

1043
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So when you consume a corpse, there's a chance that you'll create a skeletal simulacrum

1044
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
that seeks out enemies.

1045
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And when it dies, it explodes.

1046
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So essentially, you're making a scally bomb when you consume corpses.

1047
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And so that's just going to seek out targets and explode.

1048
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I think that'd be pretty handy for my Necro this season.

1049
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So I'm looking forward to that one too.

1050
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Next up, we have the umba crux.

1051
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
The umba crux is a new unique dagger for rogues.

1052
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So if you use a set or huge skill, you'll create a totem.

1053
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And if you hit that totem with an attack, it replicates any of the damage it takes.

1054
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
It all nearby enemies.

1055
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And so it's a great way for essentially replicating and doubling down on the damage that you're

1056
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
dealing in a particular area.

1057
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
All right, next up, we've got the vox omnium.

1058
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Now, the vox omnium is a new unique staff for sorks.

1059
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And so when you cast a core skill, it's going to cast an additional two basic projectiles

1060
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
based on the previous elements used.

1061
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And so this allows you to really start comboing your core and basic skills together.

1062
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And if you decide to have different elements associated with those core and basic skills,

1063
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
now you can start casting fire and lightning and cold all at the same time.

1064
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So we're pretty excited about this one too.

1065
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And the final one we're going to share out here is actually a new set of boots that's

1066
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
available for all classes.

1067
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And these are called raconoth's wake.

1068
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And so whenever you use an ability with a cooldown, you'll trigger a tongue twister, trigger

1069
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
an explosion, deal in fire damage.

1070
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And so really, it's pretty straightforward.

1071
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You're going to bathe your enemies and flames whenever you use a cooldown skill.

1072
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So maybe I'm going to dust off my whirlwind barb here and slap them on and see how it

1073
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
does.

1074
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So yeah, these are some of the uniques and legendaries that are going in to the infernal

1075
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
hordes.

1076
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I think there are 10 uniques overall and over 20 legendaries that you can farm from the

1077
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
infernal hordes.

1078
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So there's going to be a lot to chase down in there.

1079
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That's awesome.

1080
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Thank you, Dan, for like sharing going through all that stuff.

1081
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I know with players jumping in on PTR, especially for and trying out infernal hordes and everything,

1082
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
what's kind of like the top things that you really want them to like kind of hone in on,

1083
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
give feedback on, check on for PTR.

1084
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1085
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
We definitely need feedback on the PTR.

1086
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It's super critical to ensuring that the infernal hordes and all the rewards feel great

1087
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
for when the season launches.

1088
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So here are some of the topics that we could use some help on.

1089
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
First off, just how is the infernal hordes gameplay?

1090
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
How do the boons and veins feel?

1091
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Which ones do you like the most or the least?

1092
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
These are types of things that will help us fine tune that experience.

1093
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Similarly, how is it acquiring compasses?

1094
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Do you have too much to few?

1095
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
How do you feel about upgrading them?

1096
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
That could help us really dial in kind of the access to the infernal hordes.

1097
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
We're also interested in learning how you feel about the difficulty and the gameplay

1098
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
linked to the different tiers.

1099
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Like I said at the top, we've got eight different tiers of difficulty.

1100
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And so we have the ability to dial those in a little bit.

1101
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
We want to make sure that players can really replay this over and over again as they push

1102
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
into the end game much like the pit.

1103
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And then finally, of course, how are the rewards?

1104
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Which do you like the most or the least?

1105
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
We can certainly make tweaks on the rewards to make sure there is enticing as possible.

1106
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Awesome.

1107
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And I know with the infernal hordes, this is another alternative because as you mentioned,

1108
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
you can jump into it starting with World Tier 3.

1109
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So if you're actually leveling a new character, you can actually jump into infernal hordes.

1110
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And you're able to earn experience in here.

1111
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So you actually have the opportunity of jumping into Hell Tides if you want to.

1112
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You can jump into infernal hordes.

1113
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
When you get to 85 or something like that, you can jump into pits.

1114
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So there's now more or nine dungeons, obviously, when you're upgrading your glyphs and everything.

1115
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So there's a lot of different variety now for being able to level up a character, especially

1116
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
as you're going to that mid to late game.

1117
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The phase of your character's journey, you could say.

1118
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah, something else to bring up for the rewards for the infernal hordes as well that I want

1119
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
to clarify.

1120
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So Dan mentioned about, there's going to be uniques that are there that you can target

1121
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
farming the infernal hordes.

1122
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
There's actually going to be a group of uniques and legendaries that you're able to target

1123
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
farm in that piece of content in the infernal hordes.

1124
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So you're also kind of somewhere out in the normal game works, you know, how you can target

1125
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
farming unique from a boss, but you can find anywhere else in the world.

1126
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's the same way here where you can get these new uniques and legendaries anywhere, but

1127
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
you have a better chance, you know, if you're targeting them in the infernal hordes.

1128
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And this is the first time that we're doing this with a group of legendaries as well.

1129
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
We have legendary powers that are actually able to be target-formed in the infernal hordes,

1130
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
which is actually something a little bit new to the game.

1131
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So I just wanted to clarify that.

1132
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And in addition to that, we're also adding new uniques and legendaries to the rest of the

1133
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
game as well in addition to this.

1134
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So there's actually a very large group of uniques.

1135
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I think this is over 50 or something.

1136
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah, wait, there's over 50 new uniques and legendaries coming in to season five.

1137
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So we have a lot of coming.

1138
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's pretty extensive.

1139
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
A lot more to talk about there too.

1140
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, wait, this was just kind of a small preview of what people were looking at here.

1141
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And they'll be able to jump in more and actually check it out on PTR because all of them

1142
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
will be present there.

1143
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And I know Adam is actually going to talk through a few additional ones here later.

1144
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But yeah, Dan, this is awesome.

1145
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Can't wait for players to jump in.

1146
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I appreciate you informing and providing all the new updates and everything.

1147
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
It's exciting.

1148
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yep.

1149
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
From the sweltering heat of all the, I mean, I'm going to keep bringing it up.

1150
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
They can't go school up there.

1151
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
It's crazy.

1152
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Yeah.

1153
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm like, that's absolutely insane.

1154
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But we will be seeing Dan again here later, especially when we get into Q&A at the end.

1155
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But Dan, thank you again.

1156
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I think we're welcome.

1157
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah.

1158
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Awesome.

1159
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Appreciate it.

1160
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
We're going to jump into a little bit of some balance and class updates with the

1161
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
chemistry out of Jackson.

1162
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So yeah, let's get to it.

1163
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
We have a lot to talk about.

1164
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I think we have.

1165
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah.

1166
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So the topic's going to be covering today.

1167
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
We've got unique items.

1168
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
We're going to be talking quite a bit about that.

1169
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
We've got some updates to mythic uniques that are very exciting and near and dear to my

1170
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
heart.

1171
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And then we've got your standard class updates.

1172
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
A lot of stuff coming in season five.

1173
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
One thing to clarify here is that we are going to be releasing the patch notes soon.

1174
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I'm not going to be going over every single class update because there's a ton of them.

1175
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Similar to season four, I'm really only going to highlight just one major thing for each

1176
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
class on the stream today.

1177
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But you'll be able to see all the things that we're doing in the patch notes.

1178
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
There's a lot.

1179
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So first, unique.

1180
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So we have some quality of life updates here, really targeting how you get unique.

1181
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That I'm pretty pumped about to announce here today.

1182
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So you can now target farm uniques from three additional sources.

1183
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
You can target them from oval vendors, helltide chests and whisper caches.

1184
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
These places where you've always been able to target farm certain gear slots and not

1185
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
being able to get unique.

1186
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And you're wondering, well, why are you going to do that?

1187
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That's things.

1188
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Well, now you can.

1189
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And it's awesome.

1190
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I love it.

1191
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So here, just to give some more detail into how this works is basically when you open,

1192
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
like, I'm just going to use helltide chests as an example.

1193
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
If you want a specific unique weapon, let's say, you can just simply target the weapon

1194
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
helltide chests and you'll be able to have a chance to get only unique weapons for your

1195
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
class from those chests.

1196
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So when you're targeting a specific thing, you just go to the place that has that slot,

1197
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
whether it's the oval vendor the helltide chest or the whisper cache, and you'll have

1198
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
a chance to get unique that are targeted for that slot.

1199
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So it kind of adds, while you're doing your normal grind of doing the boss ladder, killing

1200
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
the boss, you can also be collecting ovals, doing the helltides, doing the whispers,

1201
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
and having a chance to target and get that unique as well from that content.

1202
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And in addition to that, this is also true for mythic uniques.

1203
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So I'll just give an example here of exactly how this works.

1204
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Let's say that you want to get, you know, Harlow can crest a shaco or and Arielle's

1205
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
visage.

1206
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
You don't want to target those helms.

1207
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You could be targeting helms from helltide, targeting helms, and, you know, when you

1208
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
turn in your ovals to the oval vendor.

1209
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And every time if you get a mythic unique, you will get one of those two from that source.

1210
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Now also to clarify, let's say that you are targeting gloves for some reason.

1211
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
You know, we don't have any mythic unique gloves yet.

1212
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Then if you were to get a mythic unique, you still can.

1213
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It'll just give you a random one instead, since you know, you can't target one in that

1214
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
slot.

1215
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So a pretty exciting way to target kind of the things that you want while you're far

1216
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
made.

1217
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Yeah, it's going to be amazing.

1218
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yeah.

1219
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I know.

1220
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I know we've heard a lot of players going like, hey, you know, we do the end game boss

1221
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
is a whole lot.

1222
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
We're trying to, and you can actually find them just in the open world as well.

1223
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
We've actually seen a lot of cases, especially with this past season where the players

1224
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
are jumping into helltide and they're actually finding them there.

1225
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
But now it's an additional, or additional options for players, which I think will be a

1226
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
lot better for just overall finding some of the gear that everyone has.

1227
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
As someone who for the last three seasons, my uniques have always come from the beast

1228
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
and ice.

1229
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I am very selfishly invested in getting into the game.

1230
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yes.

1231
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
All right, let's talk about other unique updates here.

1232
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
We're going to make a whole lot of updates to our unique items.

1233
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So I'm going to be covering a lot today.

1234
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
We've heard your feedback and we're going to be doing some updates here to clarify before

1235
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I go into what the updates are.

1236
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
You are going to be seeing these updates to like the way that we think about in our philosophy

1237
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
are unique and how they work.

1238
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You're going to be seen on the PTR for the new uniques coming into season five.

1239
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Between the PTR and the launch, you'll be seen in the season five launch.

1240
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
These updates to all the existing uniques in the game.

1241
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
So in season five comes out, basically all the uniques will get these updates done about

1242
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
to talk about.

1243
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But in the PTR, you're only going to really see this in the new uniques coming into the

1244
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
game.

1245
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah, there.

1246
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So now we can go on to the next part.

1247
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
All right.

1248
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
So the teams are talking a lot.

1249
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
As many of you probably know in season four, we did our organization 2.0.

1250
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
We didn't really update the uniques almost at all in the game, right?

1251
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
We didn't do like a big pass, like cover, how they exist in tempering or anything like

1252
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
that.

1253
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
The teams been talking a lot about what is the role of uniques in Diablo 4?

1254
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
How are they different from legendary items?

1255
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Because they're similar in that they both give you a legendary power that's really strong.

1256
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
But how are they different?

1257
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And what do we want them to be long term?

1258
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And we've kind of landed on a few things here that I'm going to talk about.

1259
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
The first one is that they're powerful and exciting items that kind of direct players

1260
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
to builds, right?

1261
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So imagine you're a fireball sort.

1262
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
We've got two uniques for you.

1263
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They really target you.

1264
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
You're going to feel a lot better playing with fireball when you take them.

1265
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
We want you to take these things and kind of level up your build.

1266
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
There are moments of like very large incremental power where you feel like you're feeling in

1267
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
your fantasy as a class.

1268
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The next one is that they're kind of pick up and play, right?

1269
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
They're easy to evaluate the moment that you pick up the unique.

1270
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
You know, you know whether it's a good one or a bad one.

1271
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
We want this to be a little bit different from legendary powers where you know you pick

1272
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
it up and you kind of go on a journey where you know you make it into something that's

1273
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
really good.

1274
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
A unique you know when you pick it up whether or not it's one that you want to keep or

1275
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
one that you don't.

1276
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
And then the last one, pretty obvious, but we're saying you know they're kind of more

1277
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
rare chase items that players don't see very often.

1278
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You know when you're going through the end game you're seeing legendary powers a lot

1279
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
because you know we have a lot of reasons to give you a lot of you want to upgrade your

1280
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
codex.

1281
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
They are the way that you can you know get greater affixes and temper and master work

1282
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
them.

1283
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So there's a reason why you want to churn and look through a lot of them.

1284
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Uniques you do want to get a good one obviously, but not nearly as often as like a legendary

1285
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
power.

1286
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So that aspect of their design.

1287
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So they are more rare they're harder to get but when you get it it's kind of like a more

1288
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
exciting moment like did I get the perfect one and then if not you go and try and get

1289
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
the next one.

1290
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So let's talk a little about our goals for the update that we're going to be doing here.

1291
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
One of the things that we come to a lot that we talk about the team is this idea we I like

1292
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
this quote of like players build their legendaries and players build around their unique

1293
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
right.

1294
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Your legendary power is is very or your legendary items are very malleable.

1295
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You know the moment you get it you don't know yet if it's going to be the best in slot

1296
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
item but it has a chance to be but they're also like able to fit in a lot of different

1297
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
ways.

1298
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You can manipulate your their stats via you know enchanting via tempering and master working

1299
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and so there's a lot that you can do with the item once you've gotten it whereas unique

1300
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
there are a lot more static right the the stats on them can't change.

1301
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You can't really manipulate them very much and sometimes they have maybe qualities to

1302
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
them or stats are a little bit inconvenient and you got to figure out like how do I overcome

1303
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
this this this little detriment or make my build into where it's a plus instead of a

1304
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
detriment right like it's a fixed thing that you have to build around which is very different

1305
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
than a legendary.

1306
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Also ideally we want players to run two to four unique in their build you know one of

1307
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
the the difficult parts of this and I think we're going to be continuing to work on with

1308
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
the balance and design of unique is that you know we want you to run some but we don't

1309
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
want you to run all of them in your build right.

1310
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It's very easy to go one way or the other I can very easily make you run no unique and

1311
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I can very easily make you run like every slot is a unique by making the really really

1312
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
crazy right.

1313
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
We want these to fit in such a way that you're running some of them the ones that are applicable

1314
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
to your build or maybe some spicy ones here or there that you try and you know like making

1315
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
a special way to work with you but not all of them I would say right now like on live

1316
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
in season four players are ready more like zero to two in their build so it's not as much

1317
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
as we want which means that we want to update them to make them a little bit more attractive.

1318
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And another one is we kind of want to move away from these generic fits all build styles

1319
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
of unique right.

1320
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
One thing I know a lot players talked about in the past that we've had is that some of

1321
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
our unique are just so generically good and this is particularly scary for us when it's

1322
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
like what we call generic unique which is when we're every class can use it and so like

1323
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
if every class can use it and every build can use it and it's better than like the build

1324
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
specific or class specific stuff then it just becomes best and slot for everybody and

1325
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
we've taken away your agency and your choice because you're just going to target this

1326
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
item and ignore everything else right.

1327
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
The only items in the game that we really want to to fit that role are like mythic uniques

1328
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
where they're across all classes and they're so good but they're also extremely rare

1329
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
so you're very excited to see them whenever you see one but all the other regular uniques

1330
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
we don't want to fit that design space.

1331
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So we're going to be trying to move away from these ones and readjust them and redesign

1332
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
them a little bit where they fit into all kinds of builds and kind of target something

1333
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
that they're really good at or that's a little bit more unique about them and make them

1334
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
really good at that and less generically good at everything.

1335
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It's funny because everyone's in the chat going like oh, Rip, Shaco, Rip, Shaco but

1336
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
we just literally not.

1337
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
We just, we just, we just, we just, we just, not, mythics is not what I'm there.

1338
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Different beasts here.

1339
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm talking about all your regular ones.

1340
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

1341
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Shaco's still going to be just as good if not better honestly.

1342
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
All right, so enough free-amble.

1343
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
All right, what are we actually doing?

1344
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So we're going to be doing two big updates to Uniques.

1345
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
The first one is we're going to be increasing the upper power of the unique effects and the

1346
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
role range.

1347
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
We're going to be doing an increase in the range from an average of 10 to 20 roles, which

1348
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I'll explain in a second.

1349
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And then we're also going to be increasing the upper power of like how much you can get

1350
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
from the roles.

1351
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
This is really just buffing pretty much most Uniques across the board to compete with

1352
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
the new world of legendary powers that we live in since you know, they got extra power

1353
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
juice to them.

1354
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Now Uniques are catching up.

1355
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So as an example here, I gave, you know, if an older unique like one on live gave you

1356
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
around 40 to 80% multiplicative damage, that's going to go up to like 40, 100, maybe

1357
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
120, maybe even higher.

1358
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Really, the mandate is as high as we can get away with without breaking things.

1359
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And then we're also going to be increasing the role range.

1360
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
This is like the number of possible roles it can do from an average of 10 to 20.

1361
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
So it'll be a little bit harder to get basically what we're targeting here is the discrepancies

1362
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
out inside of the unique is a little bit wider where the difference of like a low role

1363
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
in a high role is a little bit bigger, but the high roles are way better than they were

1364
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
before.

1365
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So they're more exciting when you get them really good, but it's a little bit harder to

1366
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
get there.

1367
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And the next one is going to be updating the affixes, the actual stats on the Uniques.

1368
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
We're doing a pass on all of them and this is kind of what we're doing.

1369
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
The first thing is we're changing their stats to fit with the season four updates, right?

1370
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
We're doing the things like we did before, of simplifying stats, you know, getting rid

1371
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
of super conditional things, making them as more generically understood and good.

1372
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
We're also going to be adding tempering stats, we're open to really adding whatever we

1373
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
want that makes the unique fit the fantasy.

1374
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
So as an example here, you know, a lot of two-hand weapon Uniques have a problem where they're

1375
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
all basically competing against bonus projectiles as an affix because you can just temper that

1376
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
onto your weapons, right?

1377
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So when it comes to those kind of situations, we'll just slap the bonus projectiles on

1378
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
that unique and now, you know, it's no longer competing in that way where we have to kind

1379
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
of dance around it.

1380
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
We can just put it.

1381
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
We're also open to the idea by the way of breaking slot restrictions, kind of like we didn't

1382
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
season two, so you can have bonus projectiles or other things on other slots, you know,

1383
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
like Uniques are where we get to play a little bit and just really make something thematic

1384
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
and cool and build the finding and so they have lesser restrictions than everything else.

1385
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And the other one is we're updating the stat power levels and the effects.

1386
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So the idea here that we're thinking, and this is particularly nuanced when it comes to

1387
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
generic Uniques, but stats that kind of fit the theme or the fantasy of Unique, we're

1388
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
going to be like way stronger than your normal stats, right?

1389
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So as an example, if you have a Unique that's targeting fire damage, maybe it's like a meteor

1390
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
or firewall and the sorcerer, whatever it may be, you know, that plus fire damage can

1391
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
be juiced up to be really, really high.

1392
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But stats that are more like generically good, like, you know, I don't know, attack speed,

1393
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
max life, resist all, those ones aren't going to be juiced unless it fits the theme of

1394
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
the Unique really well, right?

1395
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So we have an example here of one that has been a problem for us in the past, like kind

1396
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
of want to go through how we would think about it.

1397
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I'm not going to say exactly what we're going to do here to Tvultzwill, but kind of give

1398
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
you our thought process, right?

1399
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So Tvultzwill, as many of you know in previous seasons, was kind of a problem where it just

1400
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
became best in slot for almost every build.

1401
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
You know, the famous line we say is they was damage on pants, which was, you know, impossible

1402
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
to get almost anywhere else in the game.

1403
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And turn out damage on pants was really, really good, right?

1404
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And also gave you damage reduction, one of the best stats in the game.

1405
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And then it also gave you a bunch of, it also sold resources in many ways for you as well,

1406
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
right?

1407
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
It gave you a bunch of resources when everybody became unstoppable, which wasn't too

1408
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
hard to do.

1409
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So it was doing a lot of things at once.

1410
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It gave you a very unique effect with putting damage on a slot that you don't get it.

1411
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It also gave you resource, which is something that every class wants, you know, very heavily.

1412
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And Adam, it gave you three extra promotions.

1413
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And three extra post-shirts, yes.

1414
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Now that one, yeah.

1415
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
That's all right.

1416
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
But yeah, so, you know, the way that we would tackle this one to give you an idea is like,

1417
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
you know, the, we either would kind of pick, you know, do we want to focus this on the

1418
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
damage aspect, that it's damage on a non-damage slot?

1419
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Or maybe we focus on the resource aspect and like double down on that and make that really

1420
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
powerful and really cool.

1421
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Or we do like a little bit of both, but if we do both, and it's not going to give you

1422
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
the defenses that another pant slot would give, right?

1423
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Basically, in our mind, we'd be like, we want to give the minimum amount of defense, where

1424
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
it's not just like a trash item because it has nothing.

1425
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
But then after that, not so much, and you're going to have to solve your defenses in other

1426
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
slots or somewhere else to justify getting the damage on this slot is how we would think

1427
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
about it, right?

1428
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And so we're having a lot of conversations now.

1429
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I don't think we're going to nail every single item perfectly in this first pass.

1430
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So we're really looking for feedback when you, you know, jump into season five and beyond

1431
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
and we'll be adjusting them.

1432
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But I kind of want to give you an idea of what we're doing and kind of what we're thinking

1433
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and targeting with this.

1434
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I think we can move on.

1435
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
So Mythic Uniques are getting the facelift here.

1436
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So lots of updates here.

1437
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Mythic Uniques are now going to be truly mythic.

1438
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
They're getting a new color beam when they drop on the ground.

1439
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
They're coming out with an awesome new sound that you're going to hear in a little bit.

1440
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
You've got new item UI that you can see.

1441
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So they have a different color.

1442
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
They really are going to look and feel like the special items that they are.

1443
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And we have a video here to show you the sound and what it looks like on the ground.

1444
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So you can see here this beam looks, you know, very different than anything else.

1445
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Isn't that sound echoey sound?

1446
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I love it.

1447
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Sounds like a, it sounds like a, you're murdering a bunch of like church organs or something.

1448
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Yeah, it's crazy.

1449
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Yeah, so you know, with this thing drops, you're definitely going to know when you got one,

1450
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
no more like sifting through your Uniques to see if it's actually one of the mythics.

1451
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
You'll know right away.

1452
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So we're really excited about this.

1453
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Super happy it was able to get in.

1454
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
All right.

1455
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And last but not least, let's talk about class updates.

1456
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So I'm going to cover some generic things across all classes and then go through a little

1457
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
bit of each one.

1458
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Again, this is not going to be nearly close to everything that we're doing.

1459
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Just a little taste to teaser for what you can expect to see.

1460
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Let's start with things across all classes.

1461
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Once systemic update we're doing to the game is invulnerability skills are now going

1462
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,000
to start their cool down when the invulnerability ends instead of when the skill begins.

1463
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
This is really to prevent things like infinite invulnerability and really to open up design

1464
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
space for us on the team because now we can be more comfortable adding things like, you

1465
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
know, invulnerable duration to skills or cool down reduction more liberally and things

1466
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
like that where we don't have to worry about this.

1467
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
This is very similar to like, you know, what our previous games have done and some other

1468
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
games do and we do think it'll be a good fit here.

1469
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
The idea isn't really to like make it that you can't be invulnerable very often.

1470
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's just to prevent like 100% uptime where you actually break down the combat of the

1471
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
game and you're not interacting with enemies anymore.

1472
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
The next one is we reviewed monster CC and we generally reduce the CC duration and

1473
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
frequency across the board.

1474
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So you know, if you were frustrated by getting frozen for a million years and then dying,

1475
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
that'll happen much less often.

1476
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
And also to help with this, potions can be used while CC'd even while you're stunned.

1477
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So you know, while you're frozen standing there and everybody's around you trying to kill

1478
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
you, you can at least spam potion a little bit and maybe survive sometimes.

1479
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Next one we've got some bug fixes.

1480
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
These are some of the notable ones.

1481
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
We do have more coming in but these are the ones I wanted to call out.

1482
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Rogue victimize is no longer going to be double dipping on X damage, which was resulting

1483
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
in a lot more multi-puket or a lot more damage really than it was supposed to have.

1484
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Damage over time effects were getting double the amount of percent damage that they were

1485
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
supposed to and skeleton reapers were getting both book of the dead bonuses when the second

1486
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
option was selected.

1487
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And again, this is you know, just a little bit of a preview but we have other bug fixes

1488
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
coming but these are some of the bigger ones we want to call out.

1489
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
All right, now let's get to the classes.

1490
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So barbarian, they have a new unique coming in.

1491
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
This is the unbroken chain.

1492
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
This is for you support barbarians or really just more defensively oriented ones.

1493
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Basically what this is going to do is create a connection between steel grass and binary

1494
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
maelstrom where you'll be able to cast iron maelstrom a lot more often as you use steel

1495
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
grass.

1496
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And also enemies damage by our maelstrom are going to be doing less damage for a little

1497
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
while.

1498
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So the idea here is you could debuff enemies debuff those bosses and make them do less

1499
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
damage to you so you can survive better.

1500
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And next the rogue, Flurry is going to be getting a lot of big updates.

1501
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
We updated the enhancement and both of their upgrades.

1502
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
So you'll be able to see kind of a theme here going on before you know you would damage

1503
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
a crowd control or vulnerable enemy for the enhancement then you would heal.

1504
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Now when Flurry hits an enemy you can just make them vulnerable.

1505
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So actually Flurry becomes a vulnerable generator here which is pretty exciting.

1506
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And it'll also deal more damage as you hit vulnerable enemies.

1507
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Stacks up really high.

1508
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So the idea here is with Flurry builds you want to make everything vulnerable and then

1509
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
just keep walking them with Flurry and gain a bunch of damage.

1510
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And now improved Flurry is changing before it was about vulnerable spreading but now

1511
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
baseline you can just generate vulnerable so we don't need that anymore.

1512
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So now improved Flurry is going to actually give you a dash.

1513
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,000
So now similar to things like the shred on the druid you can kind of dash to your target

1514
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
and also every time you cast Flurry now it's going to heal you.

1515
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So it's going to be a lot more mobile, a lot more awesome, very cool.

1516
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And the last one not least to compete with a dash what could we do with advanced Flurry?

1517
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Well we can just add a stupid amount of damage and resource cost reduction.

1518
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
So before you had to evade through an enemy and then do damage with one cast and stun

1519
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
enemies.

1520
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Now as you spam Flurry it'll basically get a big damage bonus and it's energy cost will

1521
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
go down which will let you be able to spam it even more often.

1522
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So the idea here is you just want to be using over and over and over again and it'll

1523
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
get stronger and stronger and ramp up pretty heavily as you go.

1524
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I'm excited for Flurry Rugs.

1525
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Very excited.

1526
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Yeah, there are going to be a lot more words around bouncing around and it's going to

1527
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
be great.

1528
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Yeah, ironically I'm playing Flurry this season.

1529
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I'm always off by one.

1530
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I always play the thing and then like, oh, we're going to massively make it better next

1531
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
time.

1532
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
But it's fine.

1533
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Everything's fine.

1534
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Next, Druid Shepard's aspect.

1535
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
We've gotten feedback from players now for a while now about how Shepard's aspect kind

1536
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
of dominates the meta for Druids because you're basically both, it's both not great from

1537
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
a design and a balanced perspective on the design side.

1538
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
You know, we're telling you to put companions on your bar and then they're actually just

1539
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
buffing you.

1540
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
So you make this companion build fantasy, but it's actually just making the player better.

1541
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And then on the power side, you're basically just slotting three skills on your bar with

1542
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
your companions and then not really caring about buffing them or using them because they're

1543
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
just kind of there as proxies to make you better.

1544
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So we've changed it now where basically it's going to be about the companions.

1545
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So your companion skills are just going to deal damage for every companion that you have.

1546
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So the bigger your zoo, the better your zoo is going to perform.

1547
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And to compensate players, we're doing some pretty massive buffs to Druid skills baseline

1548
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
to compensate.

1549
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So you know, your skills are just going to be getting that damage baseline and in many

1550
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
cases a little bit more.

1551
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
So you can check that out when you see the PTR notes or the PTR patch notes after this,

1552
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
but we basically just buffed everything across the board and made it so that Shepard's

1553
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
isn't required anymore.

1554
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Next for the source service.

1555
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
This is Axiocon to it.

1556
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I'm really excited about this unique.

1557
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
This is your chain lightning unique.

1558
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
So chain lightning builds.

1559
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I know how unique that really talks to you.

1560
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
And you can see here kind of our stats and that new philosophy I told you about.

1561
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
You have a chance to double cast chain lightning on pants instead of just a weapon.

1562
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
So that's pretty cool.

1563
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
So basically the way that this works, we're going to have a video about how to explain to

1564
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
you how this works because it actually changes your skill pretty significantly.

1565
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So now when you cast chain lightning, the way it's going to work is it's going to cast

1566
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
and bounce on enemies just like before, but then it's going to come back to you and orbit

1567
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
you a little bit.

1568
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And then it's going to go out and hit another enemy and then come back to you and orbit

1569
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and then come out and then go out and do another enemy and come back.

1570
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
It's a good do that back and forth a few times.

1571
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And every time it comes back to you, it's going to drain some of your mana.

1572
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And after I drain so much mana after coming back 10 times, the bolt is actually going to

1573
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
explode for a ridiculous amount of lightning damage on enemies.

1574
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So there's a mini game here where basically, oh and by the way, you can cast multiple chain

1575
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
lightnings when this is out.

1576
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
You're basically going to be like running a gambit here and the mini game is you want to

1577
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
stack as much resource regeneration as you can so that your lightning bolts can survive

1578
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
being drained over and over and bouncing everywhere so they can last to their explosion

1579
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
and do a ton of damage to enemies.

1580
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
One thing I want to call out here also is that because it drains mana, resource cost reduction

1581
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
won't work on that drain.

1582
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
You're actually going to want to focus on gaining resource, which is a little bit different

1583
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:02,000
and kind of makes us build a little special I think and unique compared to other resource

1584
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
builds based around resource.

1585
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
So I'm going to see you in action here.

1586
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So you'll see what one cast looks like and then I'll think we'll see what it looks like

1587
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
when you spam it.

1588
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So you can see here circles, you go in his enemies, circles, you go in his enemies and

1589
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
then does a big explosion at the end that we've tuned the damage to be pretty high.

1590
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
See there?

1591
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So then it explodes.

1592
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So oh wait, oh do we have one more cast a bunch of times?

1593
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Maybe we don't.

1594
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Oh there we go.

1595
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
There we go.

1596
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So see here, you can see that as you go and keep going, going, going to explode a bunch

1597
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
of times.

1598
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
But another thing I want to point out is if you're hugging enemies at melee range, as

1599
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
it's circling you, it will also hit enemies.

1600
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
So you now have a way to like really maximize your damage by hugging bosses as such, the damage

1601
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
goes way up.

1602
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So next last but not least, the Necromancer.

1603
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
So we got some feedback.

1604
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
We've had this for a while and felt this on the team where you know, the goal of them,

1605
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
we really love, you know, we love our goal of our goal of them boys.

1606
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And you know, but sometimes it can be frustrating where you tell the goal of them to go somewhere

1607
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
and then you kind of take a while to lug his butt over there and do a slam or a shout

1608
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
or whatever and you know, things can get in the way.

1609
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And so we've kind of upgraded them a little bit.

1610
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I'll let the video speak for himself here.

1611
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
But so now you can see your goal and the Hulk smash and just jump on enemies and slam

1612
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
them down.

1613
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,000
So this will work with all of your goal types by the way, not just the iron goal but

1614
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
now your goal is going to leap to the area that you tell them to go and then castix ability.

1615
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
So we're really excited about this.

1616
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Shout out to Charles Dunn who got this change in and our animators who helped us out.

1617
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
We're really pumped for it.

1618
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
It looks amazing.

1619
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Yeah.

1620
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
So those were the class and balance changes.

1621
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I know.

1622
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
We jumped to slide there.

1623
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
How dare you production.

1624
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
No, but we are, as they wave to me like, I'm sorry.

1625
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
We do want to go into some quality of life updates.

1626
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
We do have a significant amount of quality of life updates that we do want to go through

1627
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
that will be available in season five.

1628
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And you guys will actually be able to check this out in the PTR.

1629
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
So now we can go to the next slide where we do want to talk about some hell tide and whisper

1630
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
updates specifically.

1631
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
So I know this has been kind of at least has been a pain point for me and I've heard it's

1632
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
been a pain point for others is that as you guys are going through hell tide, there are

1633
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
whisper objectives within there to help you with your progression on your whisper bar.

1634
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
But the issue with the ones in hell tide is that it's sometimes take quite a while to

1635
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
do.

1636
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And you know, you sometimes players would have to leave the hell tide to go to another

1637
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
area to complete some of these whisper objectives.

1638
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So we are optimizing this to ensure that they don't take nearly as much time.

1639
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,000
The ideal goal is to get a bunch of value within those 15 minutes and to potentially end

1640
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,000
up getting a full entire whisper at 10 point bar within 15 minutes on in one hell tide.

1641
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:03,000
So it will be a huge help because I know at least for me, I've always had to leave a

1642
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
hell tide and try to knock some of that out.

1643
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Especially help for players that are looking for additional gold because whisper catches

1644
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
that have always been great sources of gold.

1645
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And now as Adam mentioned, you can also use whisper catches to target fire.

1646
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Yeah, so maybe it's keeping things more optimized for players, which we know will be

1647
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
way better there.

1648
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
The next thing we do want to talk about is also Bainful Hearts.

1649
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I know in this may not sound like a huge quality of life thing or a buff of any sort, but we

1650
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,000
have noticed that and players have had a lot of Bainful Hearts within their inventory.

1651
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
We do want to make these a little bit more valuable so they won't drop ass frequently.

1652
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
We know that players will still have a significant amount, but maybe not hundreds and hundreds

1653
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:57,000
where some people have within their inventory, but players should not have any type of issues

1654
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
regarding having a ton of these Bainful Hearts, but we are tweaking the drop rate because

1655
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
they were dropping a little too much there.

1656
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:16,000
The very broad up topic, well, and like, people are talking about that.

1657
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
So it's pretty popular.

1658
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Yeah, so I want to take a minute to talk about tempering and how the design team sees it

1659
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
and what we're happy with, what we think could be better, and some adjustments will be

1660
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
making in season five.

1661
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,000
So first high level, how we see tempering, we really think that it's important that items

1662
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
have an endpoint where players know kind of that the item is done and that they're not

1663
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
hoarding lots of them forever on the chance that they can all be good, right?

1664
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:46,000
One of the big key goals of season four was that we didn't want you saving a million items

1665
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
in your stash space.

1666
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And while we know that breaking an item never feels great, we do need that to be something

1667
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
that's possible to do in the game so that you know when the journey is done and you're

1668
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
not just holding on to an item forever.

1669
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
So that part we actually think is working very well where you know an item is done and

1670
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
you try and go get another one.

1671
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And so you're always interested in items and trying to you know to have that game loop

1672
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,000
go for in the game indefinitely or until you feel like your character is max sound power.

1673
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
But we do agree with players that you know the RNG right now is like completely out of their

1674
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
hands which doesn't really feel great.

1675
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
You know you get you get so many tries basically to roll and then that's kind of it and you're

1676
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
done and it doesn't feel great.

1677
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
So we're looking at ways in the future for players that more control over that RNG so

1678
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
that you know you have more ways to maybe manipulate the tempering or get the odds in

1679
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
your favor and do other things like that.

1680
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
One update that's going to be coming in season five.

1681
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
It won't be in the PTR but we're targeting for launch is that you know we've got a lot

1682
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
of feedback that it feels so bad when you know you get that like triple greater aficz

1683
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
and it has the same number of rolls and then you you you brick it and then you have to try

1684
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and go get another one.

1685
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
So in season five to help with this you know as your item gets better basically that you

1686
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
find you're going to have more chances to temper it so a much better chance to get the

1687
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
one that you want.

1688
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Basically what I work is you're going to basically get one extra roll per greater aficz

1689
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
that you have.

1690
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
So you know we have one greater aficz, one roll, three, three rolls.

1691
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And again just to clarify this is not in the PTR but it will be in for the launch of

1692
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:18,000
season five in itself and I again just to reiterate we are still looking at ways to

1693
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
to help out that experience within tempering as we've noted we agree with players that

1694
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:28,000
it doesn't always feel great and so you guys should expect to hear more updates to tempering

1695
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
after we get their season five for sure.

1696
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Yeah.

1697
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Alright next up weapons.

1698
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Yeah so I'll talk about this one a little bit.

1699
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
We took a little bit.

1700
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
This chart.

1701
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Yeah this chart.

1702
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We took a look at inherent aficz on weapons and we found that you know a lot of inherent

1703
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
aficz is like damage to distant or some other ones were a little too conditional and didn't

1704
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
get the update you know in season four that we wanted.

1705
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So we went back and made them a little bit more generically useful and better across

1706
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
more builds.

1707
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So we have a little chart here but you can see kind of this is going to be the new inherent

1708
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
aficz on all the different weapon types so we made quite a few adjustments here.

1709
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
You know as an example you know vulnerable damage is on bows and thought damage is on

1710
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
axes which I believe vulnerable on bows is new.

1711
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
But yeah so we made quite a few updates we basically just looked at the matrices of everything

1712
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
and kind of adjusted it to see what makes sense.

1713
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
So basically you're just going to have you know things that actually impact your builds

1714
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
much more often on the weapons that that you want.

1715
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
And as another result of this update we are also looking at what weapons classes can

1716
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
use and we updated them a little bit to try and you know let more classes use more

1717
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
weapons.

1718
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
We want players to be able to create interesting builds play the way that we want and

1719
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
so we want to open up these things as much as we can in our designs.

1720
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So now Druids is going to be able to use two hand poems one hand swords and daggers

1721
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
sorceresses are going to be able to use one hand swords and maces and necromancers are

1722
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
going to be able to use and these maces and axes actually.

1723
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Yeah despite this necromancer picture right here that is not using it.

1724
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Well it's using a two handed sword but you can already use a two handed sword but not

1725
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:07,000
using a and yeah and the necromancer here I know it's supposed to say all maces and

1726
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
axes as opposed to all swords.

1727
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:16,000
So basically we are going to be opening up these classes to use more weapon types.

1728
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And then also some of the unique are going to be updated for the classes as well so the

1729
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
butcher's cleaver can now be used for necromancers and sorcerers can use doom brainer and

1730
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
azure wrath now.

1731
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Yeah sorcerers can use azure wrath kind of like D2.

1732
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Yep fits their theme very well too so I think that will be pretty cool.

1733
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Some additional quality of life updates.

1734
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Now we're going to talk about some end game bosses as I have experienced as Adam is

1735
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
this experience earlier as he mentioned in the stream we are making changes to the beast

1736
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
and ice.

1737
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
You guys will no longer have to make a sigil to summon the beast and ice which is a huge

1738
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
quality of life update.

1739
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The beast will now live in a standard dungeon.

1740
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
The crawl to get to the beast and ice is much much shorter now it's going to be more similar

1741
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
to what we've seen with some of the other end game bosses.

1742
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
And then at the same time eternal players that have maybe already built out some of these

1743
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
sigils we made sure to keep you in mind so you can still use the sigils to fight the boss

1744
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,000
you won't need some new materials you can just use the sigil right there in the boss room

1745
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
in itself.

1746
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And there's no longer required sigil to actually summon the beast and ice.

1747
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:33,000
So some big changes to the beast and ice to help out that whole entire feel especially

1748
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
when you're really target farming the beast and ice.

1749
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Sometimes it was kind of brutal to have to go through the whole entire dungeon each

1750
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
and every time.

1751
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
So many times.

1752
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Yeah.

1753
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
So next we have Varshan.

1754
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Varshan, the body parts are pretty much being reduced to one.

1755
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I know it was eating up a lot of inventory space.

1756
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
It was kind of hard to manage at times and everything so we're optimizing this, making

1757
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
this better.

1758
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Now you'll just need one body part two essentially summon Varshan going forward starting with season

1759
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
five.

1760
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
And one big thing that we're going to call out here before and this is kind of like

1761
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
the cherry on top.

1762
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
We should let's actually just play the clip and see if people actually notice it and

1763
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
if not then we'll call it out.

1764
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,000
What could be different this time?

1765
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Poor Durel.

1766
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Yeah, mythic unique maybe.

1767
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Oh.

1768
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
No, that's not it.

1769
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Good gear though.

1770
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Yeah.

1771
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
But something that is interesting here is the cold dream has reappeared.

1772
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
You can just resummon it.

1773
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And there's the altar right there.

1774
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,000
You can now resummon all the end game bosses without needing to run out of the dungeon and

1775
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
reset the dungeon.

1776
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
And reset the dungeon.

1777
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
So this will help a whole lot.

1778
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
We'll make things way better in terms of like optimizing when you're for time and everything.

1779
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Yeah.

1780
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Especially when you're a party and you're like everyone leave the dungeon so I can reset

1781
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
and stuff like that.

1782
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Now you'll be able to do that immediately for all the end game bosses which is a huge

1783
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
feature.

1784
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I know that players have been asking for.

1785
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
So that will be also incorporated into season five.

1786
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
So lots and lots of changes for season five.

1787
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
One other thing I did want to call out regarding tempering because just to clarify because

1788
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
we've got some people going like I don't understand like the greater afic stuff like in terms

1789
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
of additional roles.

1790
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
If you have a one star greater afic you'll get one additional role.

1791
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
If you have like a three star or four stars something you would get three or four ending

1792
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
the amount of stars that you actually specifically have on your item.

1793
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Yeah.

1794
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I think those are the three.

1795
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Three.

1796
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Sorry.

1797
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Four is unique.

1798
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Four is unique.

1799
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Yeah.

1800
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Yeah.

1801
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Yeah.

1802
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Yeah.

1803
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Yeah.

1804
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Yeah.

1805
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Yeah.

1806
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Yeah.

1807
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Yeah.

1808
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Yeah.

1809
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yeah.

1810
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah.

1811
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Yeah.

1812
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Yeah.

1813
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Yeah.

1814
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Yeah.

1815
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Yeah.

1816
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Yeah.

1817
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Yeah.

1818
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Yeah.

1819
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Yeah.

1820
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Yeah.

1821
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Yeah.

1822
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Yeah.

1823
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Yeah.

1824
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Yeah.

1825
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yeah.

1826
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yeah.

1827
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Yeah.

1828
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,000
If it was a greater afic like a three star greater afic or something like that you will end up getting those three additional

1829
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
roles afterwards.

1830
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
So that will appear after these changes actually are implemented with the start of season five.

1831
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
It'll just be on your internal character obviously because your seasonal character will

1832
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
move to eternal as I fix my earpiece.

1833
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
That's like falling out.

1834
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
No.

1835
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
But one other thing I did want to call out is well for season five.

1836
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
We have some really big like accessibility options that are being added to the actual

1837
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
game and we really really need some testing on this in the season five PTR.

1838
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
This is actually called out in our blog.

1839
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
We'd really love if players can actually check them out, test them out, provide feedback.

1840
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I will note we aren't planning.

1841
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Despite it being in the season five PTR we aren't planning on these features actually launching

1842
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
with season five.

1843
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,000
We really want to take the feedback, make them better for when they are ready and right

1844
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,000
now I think that the plan would be that they would be ready for season six but it's important

1845
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
for us to be able to get that feedback.

1846
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,000
So we really need people to actually test out these specific features.

1847
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
We have like an auto pin feature.

1848
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:21,000
We have a compass feature and then we have like an audio navigation assistance feature

1849
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
that is coming within some of these accessibility features for season five.

1850
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
So really important for people to kind of like jump in, check it out, give us feedback

1851
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:36,000
and then you'll see those in season six after the PTR is kind of over.

1852
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,000
But that is kind of like a huge wrap up of all the stuff that is coming for the season

1853
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
five PTR and even a little bit more of even even some of the stuff for season five.

1854
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:51,000
We do want to take some questions and we still have Dan on the line from the burning

1855
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:56,000
house of Albany to answer any questions that we may have.

1856
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But I know we have a question specifically teed up.

1857
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:04,000
So if you have questions please ask them in Twitch chat which is where we have live chat

1858
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
going on right now and we will try to get through as many as possible.

1859
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Cool.

1860
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:15,000
But first question I believe we have is because I teed up this question.

1861
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
There are any new class buffs coming to season five specifically if Adam can answer

1862
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Druid and Sorceress because I know we hear you and everyone about Druid and Sorceress.

1863
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I know we talked a little bit about it here but if you can like expand on it a little bit.

1864
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Yes, there are new class buffs coming to season five covered a little bit.

1865
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I think when they call out that people talk a lot about right now is how barbarians in

1866
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
particular are pretty strong and then the classes that can't get as far as they can in the

1867
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
pit feels kind of bad.

1868
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
There's a lot to chew on there but I think the short answer is yes we hear you and we're

1869
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
going to be looking to beef these things up.

1870
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
We do have some specific ways that we want to be targeting these things and there's a

1871
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
lot of history to it.

1872
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Barbarians in particular are tougher to balance.

1873
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I think I'm talked about this on stream a little bit before of because of their arsenal

1874
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
system they have more items.

1875
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Anytime that we mess with and we've mess with like the underlying systems of the game

1876
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
very heavily in the last year right season two we updated all the combat math which

1877
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
of course impacts items which impacts character power.

1878
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
We've updated in season four all of itemization which obviously directly impacts the arsenal

1879
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
system very heavily.

1880
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
When we do these large shakeups it's way more it's a lot more difficult in the short

1881
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
amount of time to get everything exactly perfect of how the common of the works of those

1882
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,000
effects are going to impact classes.

1883
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Last one end of it another end is what we're trying to do and we started with this in

1884
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,000
season four is we were looking at the other class mechanics and we want to kind of be

1885
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
flum up and give them the treatment that we kind of gave with the necromancer in the book

1886
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
of the dead.

1887
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,000
In season four we actually wanted to try this as an experiment but like hey the book of

1888
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
the dead the minions the sacrifice bonuses they're what really make necromancer feel really

1889
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
cool and special and unique.

1890
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
We're going to try and catch that up so to speak to the arsenal system on the Barbarian

1891
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
and not only just increase the numbers right is just increase the numbers is kind of

1892
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
easy we even did that in the mid season patch if you look at the jurid boons you know

1893
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
we increase them by 50% double them in any cases but we think to really help solve that

1894
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,000
on the fantasy and even just a design perspective we want to like overhaul and really look at

1895
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
these mechanics and make them way better and more thematic to classes.

1896
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
So we don't have anything to announce today for season five but that's something more

1897
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
long term that we're doing to help that problem in the future.

1898
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
In the short term we are you know looking at you know fixing the issues with these various

1899
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
classes buffing them up in different ways you know making different builds and other things

1900
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
viable and trying to keep that parity.

1901
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
We're also looking at you know bringing down the outliers of power with the Barbarian

1902
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
in different ways to make sure that they have more parity with other classes as well

1903
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
but that's kind of our short and long term vision of where we want this to be.

1904
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Awesome.

1905
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I know we have a question specifically and this is something I've seen a few times regarding

1906
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
season five for Dan because in front of Horace people are seeing this gameplay and they're

1907
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,000
hearing about like okay like I can play it can I play this on eternal and seasonal can

1908
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I play this is this like an ongoing thing going forward like what what players expect Dan.

1909
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Sure yeah so with season five we wanted to build out the end game and because we're

1910
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
building out the end game we wanted to make sure that any of the end game things we're

1911
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:42,000
putting in are on both seasonal and eternal and so in this PTR you'll be able to test out

1912
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:50,000
the eternal version of infernal Horace and so any of the rewards you get from it all that's

1913
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
eternal so all players are going to benefit from it.

1914
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Awesome.

1915
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah so all players will benefit from it and it's and as Dan mentioned it's a it's a new

1916
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
end game feature so it's like something that will be you know continuous beyond you know

1917
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
even season five is what we're looking at so yeah players can expect to jump in infernal

1918
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Horace going forward which is pretty cool yeah and yeah the feedback is going to be incredibly

1919
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,000
important during this PTR as Dan mentioned beforehand all the specific items that were really

1920
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:26,000
hoping to get you know feedback on regarding you know how the boons feel how the the rewards

1921
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
feel how the the combat feels and the waves and stuff like that will be really important

1922
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
for us during this specific moment.

1923
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
What is the this another season five question and hopefully you might be able to answer

1924
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:45,000
this Dan what is this from Lucky Luciano shout out Diablo partner what is the equivalent

1925
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
pit level of the eighth difficulty of like the infernal Horace pit level I guess or nine

1926
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:57,000
married dungeon or or monster level yeah you're making me do math here yeah we just

1927
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
ingested pit level yeah so tier tier eight tier eight of the infernal Horace is going to

1928
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:10,000
be equivalent to about monster level I think it's 180 to 200 so it goes up pretty high

1929
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:17,000
that's pretty late okay nice nice so a difficult challenge for sure which is good to hear

1930
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:29,000
we have a question from Zapadass and you all need easier names I swear do you foresee changes

1931
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:35,000
in grouping in the pit to allow a group play to be more efficient there will be changes

1932
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:41,000
it won't be something present in PTR we'll talk more about it at the season five launch

1933
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,000
but the team is very aware of it because we've heard about like hey it's kind of not great

1934
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,000
to feel like I'm getting only 50% of you know the rewards associated when I'm in a group

1935
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:57,000
within a pit if I'm not the party leader specifically so it's something that the team's taking

1936
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:02,000
in and we will have an update for players before season five and it will be live whatever

1937
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:12,000
change we have live in season five so a question from let's see oh this one's easy okay

1938
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:19,000
robot jomo what's the team's philosophy on rate of power gain it seems that the tempering

1939
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
especially players gain too much power too quickly really removing the tension from leveling

1940
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:31,000
up experience any chance to add more friction to tempering materials costs etc yeah we have

1941
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
seen a little bit of this and heard this feedback ourselves it's kind of going in two different

1942
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
ways here so the leveling experience then how tempering messes with it right the leveling

1943
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,000
experience as people probably have seen has been sped up quite a bit right we do want people

1944
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,000
to be able to kind of level quickly and get to the fun of the game as quickly as possible

1945
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
so we do want them you know we don't want there to be a ton of friction like you know we first

1946
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,000
launch the game we we had the idea that like getting to level 100 alone was a big accomplishment right

1947
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
and we've learned that you know players really want to like fulfill their power fantasies get to

1948
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
the part where they're actually like incrementally increasing their characters power and finding

1949
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
things don't use that power against and so they they enjoy that end game a lot and we want to

1950
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
get them there in a reasonable amount of time so that's the part that is like you know hey you know

1951
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
it's fine level quicker it's good right but then the other part is like tempering and kind of

1952
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
the tuning of the affixes we have heard the feedback and kind of agree with it that you know

1953
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:33,000
the early tempering recipes are really really strong right that was by design when we launched

1954
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:39,000
season four one of the big kind of mandates to the team that we felt was important was we wanted

1955
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:45,000
before season four we constantly got the feedback and knew it was true that you know your item stats

1956
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
weren't interesting enough and didn't matter enough and we're very impactful and just didn't feel

1957
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:55,000
good right and so we we very much like juice them up to be very strong and then this new tempering

1958
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
system that manipulates them we made a very strong so the out the gate our goal was that when you

1959
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
temper an item you can really feel the damage it wasn't like this incremental my damage goes up in

1960
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,000
like 10 different places here and there and now I'm strong it was like no this one thing happened

1961
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
and you felt it and it was good and so we're gonna you know try and walk that line we're gonna

1962
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
probably go a little more in between here where you know we do agree that the tempering is

1963
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
working the early game experience too much to the point that it's like you pick up an item and

1964
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,000
you don't care about the stats because you just temper something on and it's like way better right

1965
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:31,000
so we don't want that but we do still want them to feel and be really impactful so we have

1966
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:37,000
heard the feedback I don't remember don't think we have huge adjustments in season five right away

1967
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
but we are going to be looking at that leveling process and streaming and lining that quite a bit

1968
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
we're having time to actually talk about that right now with various members of the team so

1969
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:52,000
it will be looked at not tons will change in season five though awesome question from

1970
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:59,000
razzle dazzle dazzle darris dazzle dazzle darris it's a long name to log in on did you say we

1971
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:05,000
can temper unique are you open to letting us imprint affixes I had this thought we can imprint

1972
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:10,000
a unique but only once yeah going back that was kind of what I talked about with the unique section

1973
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:16,000
we right now know I'm not going to say never in the future it's definitely the obvious thing that

1974
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
we could do like it has just had tempering the unique of course but we we want them to have an

1975
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
identity that is very different from legendaries one of the concerns with that is that the more that

1976
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
you give you unique manipulation the more that they just turn into legendaries with a different

1977
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
item color when they drop on the ground right like they're actually not different in how they work

1978
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000
if we were able to manipulate manipulate stats add stats all those things so we do want them to

1979
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,000
have a different identity in the game so we're not doing it now but you know in the future we've

1980
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000
talked about it we're open to the idea but we do want to try this first of like double down you

1981
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
know what makes a unique unique and that you build around it except whether there's a little bit of

1982
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:57,000
friction rather than just turning it into the item that you want every time yeah question from

1983
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Barric is hey Adam or Adams I have a question for the Q&A how is the dev team feeling about the

1984
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
reception of season four is that making them rethink any plans for future seasons I mean I think

1985
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
one thing that we can most definitely call out here is like obviously season four has been really

1986
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,000
great like we've been hearing a lot of great feedback from players and you know we're very well

1987
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
aware of like you know how everyone's been enjoying it I think one huge thing that's helped with

1988
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
that as well was like the idea that we had a PTR for season four and now we're seeing that again

1989
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:33,000
for season five so like we know like having that moment where players can actually jump in provide

1990
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,000
feedback give us some some notes on specific things is really beneficial especially when we have

1991
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,000
like new huge features like what we did for season four which was you know obviously tempering

1992
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:48,000
master working the pit all new health times there's a ton of new features and then of course

1993
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
with season five you know players are now going to be able to run through the infernal horde

1994
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:59,000
tons of new gear and and legendary aspects for them so it's just like a ton of stuff that we know

1995
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
that we can most definitely take feedback on having those moments has really helped us with some

1996
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
of those decisions yeah I would say on the design team side I know like the people on team are

1997
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,000
very happy with how season four went it couldn't have gone better really in our eyes PTR was a huge

1998
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
deal helped us a lot especially on the balance and design side to you know get things into a better

1999
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:25,000
place another thing I may call out with season four is that uh and you have a phrase it like

2000
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
you know there's been a lot of disruption to the game right and so it's when there's that much

2001
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
disruption of like you know we update all the core math and all the items and everything it

2002
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,000
looks very difficult to get things into a fine-tuned state right and you know without giving anything

2003
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,000
away we have big updates coming in the future with you know expansion and other things but one of

2004
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
the things that we're we're looking forward to try to get as a team is when we've kind of uh

2005
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,000
settled down a little bit on the big disruptions like overall you know I did all of itemization

2006
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,000
and things like that because um you know it becomes a lot more difficult to fine-tune things like

2007
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
balance or even on the design side like designs and making sure that they work and that we're like

2008
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,000
iterating and upgrading things versus you know changing things around in huge ways so while we

2009
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,000
think it was really successful and we're happy with how itemization 2.0 turned out um the team is

2010
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,000
looking forward to like making the things as they are and make them work better and more do fine-tuning

2011
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:27,000
work and so I think you can expect in the future as a player um you know after we've done some more

2012
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
destruction and made the game like in a really good place we're very happy with it which we're really

2013
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:36,000
close to now I think um that you're you know you off tighter class balance tighter designs tighter

2014
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
roles for things and just you know the one of the things that excites me and excited the team

2015
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
about season 4 was like the tons of quality of life improvements and how much of an impact that

2016
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:51,000
makes on players which I think we knew but hit home in season 4 right like just the codex of power

2017
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,000
how that changed and how that completely fixed you know the hoarding of items and things like that

2018
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I think are what really jazz us a lot because it just makes that flow experience better like the boss

2019
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
ladder you know being able to reset bosses stuff like that I think is actually really impactful um

2020
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
and good for for the longevity of the game so we're excited to do more things like that

2021
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
all right uh last question that we have here uh is uh say

2022
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,000
well it's just saydens oh say saydens with the z and six six six afterwards very very

2023
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:30,000
the all over yeah very diablo theme is specifically asking uh what is the seasonal theme um

2024
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:36,000
are we like holding back any information right now regarding that and stuff uh

2025
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Dan I don't know if you want to clarify here or if you want me to you can

2026
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:49,000
all right so um we haven't announced the name for the season yet as far as I know but the the

2027
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:58,000
seasonal theme seems I guess fairly obvious um you know we're going back to hell and so uh the theme

2028
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:06,000
is pretty much returning to hell and while the infernal hordes is uh just one part of that uh the

2029
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:14,000
rewards are another part and uh when we have our our season five live stream uh we'll go into

2030
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,000
all of the rest of the things that we have planned for season five exactly yeah we have uh we have

2031
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:25,000
some yeah we have some we have some additional stuff uh yeah to to talk about when we we do actually

2032
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
have our season five live stream we're just uh right now the biggest focus for this stream is for

2033
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
people to hear about the content that they're going to be able to play and ptr um and we want people

2034
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:40,000
to really hone in and focus in on that uh so we can actually get that feedback uh for the team here

2035
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,000
and we can make any changes that we may need to yeah um but yeah that is kind of a gonna wrap this

2036
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:51,000
up for today for for Q and A um I I'm gonna lightening round like a few quick things

2037
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,000
sure sure chat will kill me if I don't call it out sure now we're getting a lot of questions

2038
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
about loadouts uh it is again still something that we are very well aware of and we we still plan

2039
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:07,000
on it's just takes a lot of time it's a huge huge uh amount of uh overhaul changes and everything

2040
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:14,000
from that end uh separately uh we uh uh this isn't coming up a lot auction house there are currently
