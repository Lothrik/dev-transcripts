00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you.

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you.

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you.

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Thank you.

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you.

10
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you.

11
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

12
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you.

13
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thank you.

14
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you.

15
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you.

16
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you.

17
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Thank you.

18
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you.

19
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Thank you.

20
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you.

21
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you.

22
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you.

23
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you.

24
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you.

25
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you.

26
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you.

27
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you.

28
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you.

29
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you.

30
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Thank you.

31
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Thank you.

32
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Thank you.

33
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you.

34
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thank you.

35
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Thank you.

36
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Thank you.

37
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Thank you.

38
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you.

39
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Thank you.

40
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Thank you.

41
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Thank you.

42
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Thank you.

43
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Thank you.

44
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Thank you.

45
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Thank you.

46
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Thank you.

47
00:22:30,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Thank you.

48
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Thank you.

49
00:23:30,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Thank you.

50
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Thank you.

51
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Thank you.

52
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Thank you.

53
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Thank you.

54
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Thank you.

55
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Thank you.

56
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Thank you.

57
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Thank you.

58
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Thank you.

59
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Thank you.

60
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Thank you.

61
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Thank you.

62
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Thank you.

63
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Thank you.

64
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:29,000
it's the podcast.

65
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
or we're in it.

66
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I don't know.

67
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's Friday, you guys.

68
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
We haven't done a Friday stream in,

69
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I don't know, it's been a while.

70
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's been a long while.

71
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
For feedback, though,

72
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
we will be opening up our PTR forums

73
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
for players to actually be able to submit feedback.

74
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So the Diablo 4 forums will have a special section for PTR.

75
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And then separately,

76
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
if you do want to leave feedback on other avenues,

77
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
such as like Reddit or the Community Sanctuary Discord,

78
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
places like that,

79
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
we most definitely end up combing through

80
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
all the different various ways

81
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
of players being able to provide feedback

82
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
specifically from that end.

83
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
For this PTR, we will note that

84
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
this one will be a little different than Season 4

85
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
in regards to how you can start off characters.

86
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There will still be character boosts

87
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
like what we had with the Season 4 PTR.

88
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I believe it's actually moved to a different city.

89
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I can't recall.

90
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I think we had it in Kiovashad before,

91
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and I believe it's in a different city,

92
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and I don't recall which city it is.

93
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's in the blog, though.

94
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But all that information will be there after the stream.

95
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Separately, we did incorporate a character copy feature,

96
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
but we initiated this character copy already.

97
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No one knows this, but as of yesterday,

98
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
characters were copied from your accounts over to PTR.

99
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So it gives you a little bit of variety

100
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
of being able to take over some of those characters

101
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
that you've already built out.

102
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Or, you know, if you want to,

103
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
you can still use the character boost.

104
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I will note, we do want players to be experiencing it

105
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
in a variety of ways,

106
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
like whether using your current characters

107
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
that we're copying over,

108
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
or if you're using some of the character boosts,

109
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
we do recommend,

110
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
or if you want to level up to level one,

111
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
like that's another option as well.

112
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It allows us to get feedback

113
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
from all different aspects.

114
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So we do recommend, you know,

115
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
trying it out in different ways

116
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and providing feedback of like how things feel,

117
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
how things flow within the PTR itself.

118
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So that is all kind of like

119
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the general housekeeping notes that we do have.

120
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh, and I will say that I believe we actually did,

121
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
we did correct that Codex of Power reset thing as well.

122
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So yeah, I remember that was plaguing some people last season.

123
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We did correct that.

124
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So it won't reset, I believe,

125
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
every single time you end up like creating a new character

126
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
or boosting a new character, I believe.

127
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And then separately on the forums,

128
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
we will have a known issues list

129
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
because they're, you know, it's PTR,

130
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
it's an early build.

131
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So we want to make sure that people are aware of that.

132
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And with PTR, you know, when we take in feedback,

133
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
it's great for players to be able to like

134
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
provide all various forms of feedback.

135
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I will say by the time season five launches,

136
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
we will try our best to get as much of that feedback in.

137
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
If it's something that's like a massive,

138
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
like, oh, like a huge overhaul or something like that,

139
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I wouldn't expect it in season five,

140
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
but it is good to hear that feedback

141
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
because it might be something that we end up incorporating

142
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
maybe in the future

143
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
for like a future season from that end.

144
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah, it's very useful.

145
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So it helps us drive future decisions.

146
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And even we did a lot of reaction to PTR feedback in season four.

147
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
If I remember right,

148
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
we did like a whole lot on our team at least.

149
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And I expect the same for season five.

150
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So exactly.

151
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Send it in.

152
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It's very useful.

153
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And then one last thing I do want to note is

154
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
because players have probably seen when season four is ending,

155
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
which is currently in early August.

156
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You can see that kind of like on your character select screen

157
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
when you're jumping into the game.

158
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I will note that season five is a little bit shorter of a season

159
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
than what we've had beforehand.

160
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Season five itself will run until that October 8th date

161
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
with Vessel of Hatred

162
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
because Vessel of Hatred is actually the start of season six.

163
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So we did want to at least clarify,

164
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
make sure because we've heard a lot of those questions of like,

165
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
hey, is Vessel of Hatred hitting in the middle of season five?

166
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Things like that.

167
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So we did want to note that from that end.

168
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
But enough of the housekeeping notes.

169
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I know a lot of players want to hear about season five in itself.

170
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And so Mr. Dan Tanguay from the sweltering city limits of Albany

171
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
will be walking us through season five.

172
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, absolutely.

173
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So yeah, let's dive into the new features on PTR for season five.

174
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Just to give you a little bit of context,

175
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
you know, we did some early brainstorming for season five

176
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and we knew that, you know, we needed to build out the end game.

177
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So end game, you know, we've heard y'all that end game is very important.

178
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And season four, we added the pit into the end game

179
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and some people have been playing Helltides into the end game.

180
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But we still want to expand the end game a bit more, right?

181
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So if it's an end game activity,

182
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
we definitely need something that's rewarding and very replayable.

183
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We also wanted to make something with a lot of monsters.

184
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I mean, monster density and just entering that feeling of flow state

185
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
is really important for players.

186
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
We needed something that had stakes and we wanted players to push their luck.

187
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And finally, we really wanted to return to Hell.

188
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
You know, previous Diablo games let you return to Hell

189
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
after you defeat the big boss,

190
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
but Diablo 4 hadn't done that yet.

191
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And so with all those goals in mind,

192
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
let me introduce you to the Infernal Hordes.

193
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Now, let me give you a quick summary of what the Infernal Hordes is.

194
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It's a wave-based gameplay mode

195
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
with survivor-like choices in between the waves

196
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and it'll culminate with an all-new boss encounter

197
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
and then the rewards build on top of itemization 2.0

198
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
that came in season four.

199
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So now how do you go about confronting the internal hordes?

200
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
How do you get back to Hell?

201
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I think we can queue up some footage

202
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
and then I'll talk you through some of the ways you get back to Hell.

203
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
All right.

204
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
First off, you're going to unlock, you know, the activity for Hell

205
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
with a brisk eternal questline starting at World Tier 3 in Zarbenzet.

206
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That's where you need to go in the PTR.

207
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Now, you need a new type of key called a compass,

208
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
which you can see down in the inventory below here.

209
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And like Nightmare Dungeons,

210
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
the compasses all have a starting monster difficulty

211
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
and a number of revives.

212
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And there are eight levels of difficulty

213
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
with escalating challenge and rewards.

214
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
As you can see, it's a very Nightmare Dungeon-like flow here.

215
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And then compasses can be upgraded to higher tiers

216
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
with all new consumables called Abyssal Scrolls.

217
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So you'll get a chance to play with all these new features

218
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
when you're in the PTR.

219
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But let's really talk about the gameplay itself.

220
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And I think we've got some footage of the wave-based play

221
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
that we could show off here.

222
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
First off, going to have a lot of monsters.

223
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Now, you have one monster here.

224
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
This is the start of wave one.

225
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And so you defeat this Aether Fiend,

226
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and it's going to drop something called Burning Aether,

227
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
which is a new currency.

228
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Now, this new currency is specific to hell,

229
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and you use it to unlock the spoils of hell

230
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
at the end of a run.

231
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And at the end of each wave,

232
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
there's going to be what's called the Infernal Offer.

233
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So let's get through this wave,

234
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and we'll take a look at the Infernal Offer.

235
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Now, you see these hands reaching out from hell itself,

236
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
and they're tempting you with a choice.

237
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
You're going to choose the form of your destructor.

238
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You're going to pick a boon and a bane

239
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
that impacts the rest of your run.

240
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And so now you've chosen a boon and a bane,

241
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
and that's going to modify the gameplay that comes up next.

242
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And so here you're jumping into one of the new activities

243
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
that also unlocks Aether in this.

244
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And this is a Soul Spire.

245
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's pretty similar to a Hell Spire

246
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
that you'd see in Helltide.

247
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And you have to kill a number of enemies within that ring

248
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
in order to be able to earn an Aether.

249
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And you can upgrade Soul Spires

250
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
from the Infernal Offer as well, if you like.

251
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And then finally, what you need to do

252
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
is complete the number of waves

253
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in order to be able to confront the boss.

254
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And so you see in this particular run,

255
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
you're at five of five waves.

256
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So you are just about ready once you defeat this wave

257
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
to go confront the new bosses for the Infernal Hordes.

258
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So we'll finish collecting our Aether here,

259
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
find our last number of enemies,

260
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
and I think we're good.

261
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I think we're ready to go.

262
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So let's take a look at our new bosses.

263
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I think we've got some cool art to share here.

264
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So these are the Fel Council.

265
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
They're going to be some familiar faces for Diablo II players.

266
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
They are resurrected versions of the Council members

267
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
from Diablo II.

268
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Now for those of you who didn't play Diablo II,

269
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
the Council members were former high priests of the Zacarum,

270
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and they had promised to basically take care of Mephisto

271
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
after he'd been trapped in the Soul Stone,

272
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and he'd been hidden down and caressed and travencle.

273
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And of course, as it happens,

274
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Mephisto corrupted them,

275
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
both in mind first and then their bodies,

276
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and they became demons who are just zealous and serve him without question.

277
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And so we thought it was going to be really cool to be able to resurrect them

278
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and bring them back for Diablo IV,

279
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and they fit great in hell.

280
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
We had to tweak their power sets a little bit

281
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
to fit the D4 combat system.

282
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So we gave them new titles and new looks

283
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
to really reflect their combat specialties.

284
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's incredibly awesome to see these guys come back.

285
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
It's giving very nostalgic vibes

286
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
of doing a bunch of endurance of hate runs for Mephisto

287
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and doing Meph runs and everything like that.

288
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So yeah, it's really awesome to see them back in Season 5.

289
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah, I agree.

290
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Diablo II is certainly near and dear to our hearts here out in New York.

291
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And yeah, we're really glad to have them back,

292
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and we hope to see hopefully more returning new faces in the future too.

293
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So let's take a look at that boss encounter now.

294
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So I showed you a number of members of the Fell Council here.

295
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
We've actually built five of them in total,

296
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
but you're only going to fight three at a time.

297
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Now we keep two in the hopper basically,

298
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and we do that because we want to have a whole bunch of replay

299
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
associated with this boss fight.

300
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And because we're only using three of the five,

301
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
there's actually 10 variations of this boss fight you can fight

302
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
randomly as you do your Infernal Run.

303
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And so we're going to basically kill them off.

304
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And once you defeat one, the fight will actually escalate.

305
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Actually, it probably escalates even if you just take down

306
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
a certain amount of health, if I remember correctly.

307
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And it escalates.

308
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Basically, their attacks become more powerful,

309
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and then they start really getting even more powerful

310
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
kind of room-clearing attacks towards the end.

311
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But we've defeated them here,

312
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and this is the reward moment I actually wanted to talk through with you

313
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
because this is something that really ties into itemization 2.0.

314
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
You've got several chests here,

315
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and you've got a choice of the rewards you get

316
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
at the end of your Infernal Run.

317
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You can choose from a chest that contains all new legendaries and new uniques.

318
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You can choose from a chest that contains all sorts of crafting materials,

319
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
including masterworking materials.

320
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So you don't need to go to the pit anymore exclusively

321
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
to get masterworking materials.

322
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You've got a chest that allows you just to get a whole bunch of gold.

323
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I know people out there are really asking for gold,

324
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
and this is going to be a good source of it.

325
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And finally, even though it wasn't shown here,

326
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
you have a chest that guarantees a single item with a greater affects on it.

327
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
And so we thought we'd want to try this out

328
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and see how people respond to it.

329
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And we thought it would be pretty exciting.

330
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You know, certainly in Season 4,

331
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm really trying to get some more greater affectses,

332
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
so I'd love to have this in Season 5.

333
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So yeah, let's take a closer look at some of the uniques

334
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
you can farm from the Infernal Horde

335
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
since we're talking about rewards already.

336
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So we're going to queue up some footage here.

337
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So first up, we've got the Basilisk.

338
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And so this is going to be a new unique staff for Druids.

339
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And so when you hit an enemy with a Nerf skill,

340
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
it'll petrify them and deal physical damage.

341
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So turning the monsters to stone, always cool.

342
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
But it's also cool that you can CC your target

343
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and boost your initial attack here.

344
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So this one's pretty exciting for you Druid players out there.

345
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
All right, next up, we've got the Third Blade.

346
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Now this is a unique sword for Barbarians.

347
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
This one makes your Weapon Mastery skills

348
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
be treated as core skills that cost Fury.

349
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Even though they deal a little reduced damage,

350
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
this one's pretty exciting because now you can start making

351
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
all sorts of new builds that you've never seen before.

352
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So we're really interested to see what the community comes up with here.

353
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
All right, next up, we've got the Mordicrux.

354
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Now the Mordicrux is a new unique dagger for Necros.

355
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So when you consume a corpse,

356
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
there's a chance that you'll create a skeletal simulacrum

357
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
that seeks out enemies.

358
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And when it dies, it explodes.

359
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So essentially, you're making a Skelly Bomb

360
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
when you consume the corpses.

361
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And so that's just going to seek out targets and explode.

362
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I think that'd be pretty handy for my Necro this season.

363
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So I'm looking forward to that one too.

364
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Next up, we have the Mordicrux.

365
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Now the Mordicrux is a new unique dagger for Rogues.

366
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So if you use a Sutterfuge skill, you'll create a Totem.

367
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And if you hit that Totem with an attack,

368
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
it replicates any of the damage it takes to all nearby enemies.

369
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And so it's a great way for essentially replicating

370
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and doubling down on the damage that you're dealing in a particular area.

371
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
All right, next up, we've got the Vox Omnium.

372
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Now the Vox Omnium is a new unique staff for Sorcs.

373
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And so when you cast a Core skill,

374
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
it's going to cast an additional two basic projectiles

375
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
based on the previous elements used.

376
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And so this allows you to really start comboing

377
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
your Core and Basic skills together.

378
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And if you decide to have different elements

379
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
associated with those Core and Basic skills,

380
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
now you can start casting Fire and Lightning and Cold

381
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
all at the same time.

382
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So we're pretty excited about this one too.

383
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And the final one we're going to share out here

384
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
is actually a new set of boots that's available for all classes.

385
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And these are called Rackanoth's Wake.

386
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And so whenever you use an ability with a cooldown,

387
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
you'll trigger an explosion dealing fire damage.

388
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And so really, it's pretty straightforward.

389
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
You're going to bathe your enemies in flames

390
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
whenever you use a cooldown skill.

391
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
So maybe I'm going to dust off my Whirlwind Barb here

392
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and slap them on and see how it does.

393
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So yeah, these are some of the Uniques and Legendaries

394
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
that are going in to the Infernal Hordes.

395
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I think there are 10 Uniques overall

396
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and over 20 Legendaries that you can farm from the Infernal Hordes.

397
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So there's going to be a lot to chase down in there.

398
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That's awesome.

399
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Thank you, Dan, for sharing and going through all that stuff.

400
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I know with players jumping in on PTR,

401
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
especially for and trying out Infernal Hordes and everything,

402
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
what's kind of like the top things that you really want them to like kind of hone in on,

403
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
give feedback on, check on for PTR?

404
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah, absolutely.

405
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
We definitely need feedback on the PTR.

406
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's super critical to ensuring that the Infernal Hordes

407
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and all the rewards feel great for when the season launches.

408
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So here are some of the topics that we could use some help on.

409
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
First off, just how is the Infernal Hordes gameplay?

410
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
How do the Boons and Banes feel?

411
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Which ones do you like the most or the least?

412
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And these are types of things that will help us fine-tune that experience.

413
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Similarly, how is it acquiring compasses?

414
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Do you have too much, too few?

415
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
How do you feel about upgrading them?

416
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
That could help us really dial in kind of the access to the Infernal Hordes.

417
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
We're also interested in learning how you feel about the difficulty

418
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and the gameplay length of the different tiers.

419
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Like I said at the top, we've got eight different tiers of difficulty.

420
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And so we have the ability to dial those in a little bit.

421
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
We want to make sure that players can really replay this over and over again

422
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
as they push into the endgame, much like the pit.

423
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And then finally, of course, how are the rewards?

424
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Which do you like the most or the least?

425
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
We can certainly make tweaks on the rewards

426
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
to make sure they're as enticing as possible.

427
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Awesome.

428
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah, and I know with Infernal Hordes, this is another alternative

429
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
because, as you mentioned, you can jump into it starting with World Tier 3.

430
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So if you're actually leveling a new character,

431
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
you can actually jump into Infernal Hordes

432
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
and you're able to earn experience in here.

433
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So you actually have the opportunity of jumping into Helltides if you want to.

434
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You can jump into Infernal Hordes.

435
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
When you get to 85 or something like that, you can jump into pits.

436
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
So there's now more...

437
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Or Nightmare Dungeons, obviously, when you're upgrading your glyphs and everything.

438
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So there's a lot of different variety now for being able to kind of level up a character,

439
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
especially as you're going to that mid-to-late game phase of your character's journey, you could say.

440
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah, something else to bring up for the rewards for the Infernal Horde as well

441
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
that I want to clarify.

442
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So Dan mentioned about there's going to be uniques that are there

443
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
that you can target farm in the Infernal Hordes.

444
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
There's actually going to be a group of uniques and legendaries

445
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
that you're able to target farm in that piece of content in the Infernal Hordes.

446
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So you're also kind of similar to how the normal game works,

447
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
how you can target farm a unique from a boss,

448
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
but you can find it anywhere else in the world.

449
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's the same way here where you can get these new uniques and legendaries anywhere,

450
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
but you have a better chance if you're targeting them in the Infernal Hordes.

451
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And this is the first time that we're doing this with a group of legendaries as well.

452
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
We have legendary powers that are actually able to be target farmed in the Infernal Hordes,

453
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
which is actually something a little bit new to the game.

454
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So I just wanted to clarify that.

455
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And in addition to that, we're also adding new uniques and legendaries

456
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
to the rest of the game as well in addition to this.

457
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So there's actually a very large group of uniques.

458
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I think it's over 50 or something.

459
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah, there's over 50 new uniques and legendaries coming into Season 5.

460
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So we have a lot coming.

461
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It's pretty extensive.

462
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
More to talk about there too.

463
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, this was just kind of a small preview of what people are looking at here,

464
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and they'll be able to jump in more and actually check it out on PTR

465
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
because all of them will be present there.

466
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And I know Adam is actually going to talk through a few additional ones here later.

467
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
But yeah, Dan, this is awesome.

468
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Can't wait for players to jump in.

469
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I appreciate you informing and providing all the new updates and everything.

470
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah, it's exciting.

471
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
From the sweltering heat of all...

472
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm going to keep bringing it up.

473
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
They canceled school up there.

474
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It's crazy.

475
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm like, that's absolutely insane.

476
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But we will be seeing Dan again here later,

477
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
especially when we get into Q&A at the end.

478
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But Dan, thank you again.

479
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I think we're...

480
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Oh, you're welcome.

481
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah.

482
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Awesome.

483
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Appreciate it.

484
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And then I think we're going to jump into a little bit of some balance and class updates

485
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
with Mr. Adam Jackson.

486
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah, let's get to it.

487
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We have a lot to talk about.

488
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I think we have...

489
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Yeah, so the topics I'm going to be covering today,

490
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
we've got unique items.

491
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
We're going to be talking quite a bit about that.

492
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
We've got some updates to mythic uniques that are very exciting

493
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and near and dear to my heart.

494
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And then we've got your standard class updates,

495
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
a lot of stuff coming in Season 5.

496
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
One thing to clarify here is that we are going to be releasing the patch notes soon,

497
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
so I'm not going to be going over every single class update

498
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
because there's a ton of them.

499
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Kind of similar to Season 4.

500
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm really only going to highlight just one major thing for each class on the stream today.

501
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
But you'll be able to see all the things that we're doing in the patch notes.

502
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,000
There's a lot.

503
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So first, uniques.

504
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We have some quality of life updates here,

505
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
really targeting how you get uniques

506
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
that I'm pretty pumped about to announce here today.

507
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So you can now target farm uniques from three additional sources.

508
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
You can target them from Ovalvendors,

509
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Helltide Chess, and Whisper Caches.

510
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
These places where you've always been able to, you know,

511
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
kind of target farm certain gear slots

512
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and not been able to get uniques.

513
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And you're wondering, well, why couldn't we do that?

514
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That stinks.

515
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Well, now you can.

516
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And it's awesome.

517
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And I love it.

518
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,000
So here, just to give some more detail into how this works,

519
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
is basically when you open, like,

520
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I'm just going to use Helltide Chess as an example, right?

521
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
If you want a specific unique weapon, let's say,

522
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
you can just simply target the weapon Helltide Chess,

523
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
and you'll be able to have a chance to get only unique weapons

524
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
for your class from those chests.

525
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
So when you're targeting a specific thing,

526
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
you just go to, you know, the place that has that slot,

527
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
whether it's the Ovalvendor, the Helltide Chess,

528
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,000
or the Whisper Cache,

529
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and you'll have a chance to get uniques

530
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
that are targeted for that slot.

531
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So it kind of adds, you know,

532
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
while you're doing your normal grind of, you know,

533
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
doing the boss ladder, killing the boss,

534
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
you can also be collecting Obles, doing the Helltides,

535
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
doing the Whisperers,

536
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
and having a chance to target and get that unique as well

537
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
from that content.

538
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And in addition to that,

539
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
this is also true for mythic uniques.

540
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So I'll just give an example here of exactly how this works.

541
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Let's say that you want to get, you know,

542
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Harlequin Crest, a Shaco, or an Daryl's Visage.

543
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You don't want to target those helms.

544
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
You could be targeting helms from Helltide,

545
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
targeting helms when you turn in your obals,

546
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
the Ovalvendor.

547
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And every time, if you get a mythic unique,

548
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
you will get one of those two from that source.

549
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Now, also to clarify,

550
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
let's say that you are targeting gloves for some reason.

551
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You know, we don't have any mythic unique gloves yet.

552
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Then if you were to get a mythic unique,

553
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
you still can.

554
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It'll just give you a random one instead,

555
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
since, you know, you can't target one in that slot.

556
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So pretty exciting way to target kind of the things that you want

557
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,000
while you're farming.

558
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Yeah, it's going to be amazing.

559
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I know we've heard a lot of players going like,

560
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
hey, you know, we do the endgame bosses a whole lot.

561
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And you can actually find them just in the open world as well.

562
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
We've actually seen a lot of cases,

563
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
especially with this past season,

564
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
where players are jumping into Helltide

565
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
and they're actually finding them there.

566
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
But now it's an additional,

567
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
or additional options for players,

568
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
which I think will be a lot better

569
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
for just overall finding some of the gear

570
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
that everyone really wants.

571
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
As someone who, for the last three seasons,

572
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
my uniques have always come from the Beast and Ice,

573
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I am very selfishly invested in getting this into the game.

574
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Yes, yes.

575
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
All right, let's talk about other unique updates here.

576
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
We're going to be making a whole lot of updates

577
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
to our unique items.

578
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
So I'm going to be covering a lot today.

579
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
We've heard your feedback,

580
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and we're going to be doing some updates here.

581
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
To clarify before I go into what the updates are,

582
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
you are going to be seeing these updates

583
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
to like the way that we think about

584
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
and our philosophy around uniques and how they work.

585
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
You're going to be seeing them in the PTR

586
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
for the new uniques coming into season five.

587
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Between the PTR and the launch,

588
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
you'll be seeing in the season five launch,

589
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
these updates to all the existing uniques in the game.

590
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So when season five comes out,

591
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
basically all the uniques will get these updates

592
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
that I'm about to talk about.

593
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But in the PTR,

594
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
you're only going to really see this

595
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
in the new uniques coming into the game.

596
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah, there.

597
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
So now we can go on to the next part.

598
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
All right.

599
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
So the team's been talking a lot.

600
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
As many of you probably know,

601
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
in season four,

602
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
we did itemization 2.0.

603
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
We didn't really update the uniques

604
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
almost at all in the game, right?

605
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
We didn't do like a big pass

606
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
to like cover how they exist in tempering

607
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
or anything like that.

608
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So the team's been talking a lot about,

609
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,000
you know,

610
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
what is the role of uniques in Diablo 4?

611
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Like how are they different from legendary items?

612
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Because they're kind of similar

613
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,000
in that they both give you,

614
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
you know,

615
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
a legendary power that's really strong.

616
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
But how are they different?

617
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And what do we want them to be long term?

618
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And we've kind of landed on a few things here

619
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
that I'm going to talk about.

620
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,000
The first one is that,

621
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
you know,

622
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
they're powerful and exciting items

623
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
that kind of direct players to builds, right?

624
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So imagine you're a Fireball sort.

625
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,000
You know,

626
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
we've got two uniques for you.

627
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They really target you.

628
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You're going to feel a lot better

629
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
playing with Fireball when you take them.

630
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,000
You know,

631
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
we want you to take these things

632
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and kind of level up your build.

633
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They're moments of like

634
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
very large incremental power

635
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
where you feel like you're,

636
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
you know,

637
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
filling in your fantasy as a class.

638
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The next one is that

639
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
they're kind of pick up and play, right?

640
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
They're easy to evaluate.

641
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
The moment that you pick up the unique,

642
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,000
you know,

643
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
you know whether it's a good one

644
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,000
or a bad one.

645
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
We want this to be a little bit different

646
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
from legendary powers

647
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
where, you know,

648
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,000
you pick it up

649
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
and you kind of go on a journey

650
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
where, you know,

651
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
you make it into something

652
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
that's really good.

653
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:08,000
A unique,

654
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
you know when you pick it up

655
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,000
whether or not

656
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
it's one that you want to keep

657
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
or one that you don't.

658
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And then the last one,

659
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,000
pretty obvious,

660
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,000
but was worth saying,

661
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
you know,

662
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
they're kind of more rare chase items

663
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
that players don't see very often.

664
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,000
You know,

665
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
when you're going through the end game,

666
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
you're seeing legendary powers a lot

667
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
because, you know,

668
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
we have a lot of reasons

669
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
to give you a lot of them.

670
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You want to upgrade your codex.

671
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
They are the way that you can,

672
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,000
you know,

673
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
get greater affixes

674
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and temper and masterwork them.

675
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So there's a reason why

676
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
you want to churn

677
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and look through a lot of them.

678
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Uniques,

679
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
you do want to get a good one,

680
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,000
obviously,

681
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
but not nearly as often

682
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
as like a legendary power.

683
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,000
We don't need that,

684
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
that aspect of their design.

685
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
So they are more rare.

686
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,000
They're harder to get,

687
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
but when you get it,

688
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
it's kind of like

689
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000
a more exciting moment.

690
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Like,

691
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
did I get the perfect one?

692
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And then if not,

693
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
you go and try and get the next one.

694
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
So let's talk a little about

695
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
our goals for the update

696
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
that we're going to be doing here.

697
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
One of the things

698
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
that we come to a lot

699
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
that we talk about on the team

700
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,000
is this idea,

701
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and I like this quote,

702
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000
of like,

703
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
players build their legendaries

704
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
and players build around

705
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
their uniques, right?

706
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Your legendary power is very,

707
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
or your legendary items

708
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
are very malleable.

709
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You know,

710
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
the moment you get it,

711
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
you don't know yet

712
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,000
if it's going to be

713
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
the best in slot item,

714
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
but it has a chance to be.

715
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But they're also like

716
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,000
able to fit

717
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
in a lot of different ways.

718
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You can manipulate

719
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
their stats via,

720
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,000
you know,

721
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
enchanting,

722
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
via tempering,

723
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and masterworking.

724
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And so there's a lot

725
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
that you can do

726
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
with the item

727
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
once you've gotten it.

728
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Whereas uniques,

729
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
they're a lot more static, right?

730
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
The stats on them

731
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
can't change.

732
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
You can't really

733
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
manipulate them very much.

734
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And sometimes

735
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
they have maybe

736
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
qualities to them

737
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,000
or stats that are

738
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
a little bit inconvenient.

739
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And you've got to figure out,

740
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,000
like,

741
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
how do I overcome

742
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
this little detriment

743
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
or make my build

744
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
into where it's a plus

745
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
instead of a detriment, right?

746
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Like,

747
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
it's a fixed thing

748
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
that you have to build around,

749
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,000
which is very different

750
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
than a legendary.

751
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Also,

752
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
ideally,

753
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,000
we want players

754
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
to run two to four uniques

755
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
in their build.

756
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,000
You know,

757
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
one of the difficult parts

758
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
of this,

759
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and I think we're going

760
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
to be continuing

761
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
to work on with the balance

762
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and design of uniques,

763
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,000
is that,

764
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,000
you know,

765
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
we want you to run some,

766
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
but we don't want you

767
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
to run all of them

768
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
in your build, right?

769
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It's very easy

770
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,000
to go one way or the other.

771
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I can very easily

772
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
make you run no uniques,

773
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
and I can very easily

774
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000
make you run, like,

775
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
every slot is a unique

776
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,000
by making them really,

777
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
really crazy, right?

778
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We want these to fit

779
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
in such a way

780
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000
that you're running

781
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
some of them,

782
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,000
the ones that are applicable

783
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
to your build,

784
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
or maybe some spicy ones

785
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
here or there

786
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,000
that you try and,

787
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,000
you know,

788
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
like,

789
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
make in a special way

790
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
to work with you,

791
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
but not all of them.

792
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I would say right now,

793
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
like on live in season four,

794
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
players are running more

795
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
like zero to two

796
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,000
in their build,

797
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
so it's not as much

798
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
as we want,

799
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,000
which means that we want

800
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
to update them

801
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,000
to make them a little

802
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
bit more attractive.

803
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And another one is

804
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
we kind of want to move away

805
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
from these generic

806
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
fits all build styles

807
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
of uniques, right?

808
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
One thing that I know

809
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,000
a lot of players

810
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
have talked about

811
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,000
in the past

812
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
that we've had

813
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
is that some of our uniques

814
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
are just so generically good,

815
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
and this is particularly

816
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
scary for us

817
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
when it's like

818
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
what we call generic unique,

819
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,000
which is one where

820
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
every class can use it,

821
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and so like if every class

822
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,000
can use it

823
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
and every build can use it

824
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and it's better

825
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
than like the build specific

826
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
or class specific stuff,

827
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000
then it just becomes

828
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
best in slot for everybody,

829
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,000
and we've taken away

830
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
your agency and your choice

831
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,000
because you're just

832
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
going to target this item

833
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
and ignore everything else,

834
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
right?

835
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
The only items in the game

836
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
that we really want

837
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
to fit that role

838
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
are like mythic uniques

839
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
where they're across all classes

840
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and they're so good,

841
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
but they're also extremely rare,

842
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
so you're very excited

843
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
to see them

844
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
whenever you see one,

845
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
but all the other

846
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,000
regular uniques,

847
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
we don't want to fit

848
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
that design space,

849
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
so we're going to be

850
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
trying to move away

851
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
from these ones

852
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and readjust them

853
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and redesign them

854
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,000
a little bit

855
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
where they fit

856
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
into all kinds of builds

857
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
and kind of target

858
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,000
something that they're

859
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
really good at

860
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
or that's a little bit

861
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
more unique about them

862
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
and make them

863
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
really good at that

864
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and less generically

865
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,000
good at everything.

866
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,000
It's funny because

867
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
everyone's in the chat

868
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
going like,

869
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
oh, rip Shaco,

870
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
rip Shaco,

871
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
but we just literally,

872
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
we just said.

873
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Mythics is not,

874
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
they're a different beast here.

875
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I'm talking about

876
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
all your regular ones.

877
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

878
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah, Shaco's still

879
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
going to be just as good,

880
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
if not better, honestly.

881
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,000
All right, so,

882
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
enough preamble, right?

883
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
What are we actually doing?

884
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,000
So, we're going to be doing

885
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
two big updates

886
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
to uniques.

887
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The first one is

888
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
we're going to be

889
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
increasing the upper power

890
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
of the unique effects

891
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
and the roll range.

892
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
We're going to be doing

893
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
an increase in the range

894
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,000
from an average

895
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
of 10 to 20 rolls,

896
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
which I'll explain

897
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
in a second,

898
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and then we're also

899
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,000
going to be increasing

900
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
the upper power

901
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
of how much you can get

902
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,000
from the rolls.

903
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
This is really just buffing

904
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
pretty much most uniques

905
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
across the board

906
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
to compete with the new world

907
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,000
of legendary powers

908
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
that we live in

909
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000
since, you know,

910
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
they got extra power juice

911
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,000
to them.

912
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Now uniques are catching up.

913
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So, as an example here,

914
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I gave, you know,

915
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
if an older unique,

916
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000
like one on live,

917
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
gave you around 40 to 80%

918
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
multiplicative damage,

919
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
that's going to go up

920
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
to like 40, 100,

921
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
maybe 120,

922
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
maybe even higher.

923
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Really, the mandate is

924
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
as high as we can get away with

925
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
without breaking things.

926
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And then we're also

927
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,000
going to be increasing

928
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
the roll range.

929
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
This is like the number

930
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
of possible rolls it can do

931
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
from an average of 10 to 20.

932
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So, it'll be a little bit

933
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
harder to get basically,

934
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
what we're targeting here

935
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
is the discrepancy

936
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,000
inside of a unique

937
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
is a little bit wider

938
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
where the difference

939
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
of like a low roll

940
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,000
and a high roll

941
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
is a little bit bigger,

942
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
but the high rolls

943
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
are way better

944
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
than they were before.

945
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So, they're more exciting

946
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
when you get them

947
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
really good,

948
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
but it's a little bit

949
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
harder to get there.

950
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And the next one

951
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
is going to be updating

952
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
the affixes,

953
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the actual stats

954
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,000
on the uniques.

955
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,000
We're doing a pass

956
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
on all of them

957
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
and this is kind of

958
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,000
what we're doing.

959
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
The first thing is

960
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,000
we're changing their stats

961
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
to fit with the season 4

962
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
updates, right?

963
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
We're doing the things

964
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
like we did before

965
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
of simplifying stats,

966
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,000
you know,

967
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,000
getting rid of

968
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
super conditional things,

969
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,000
making them just more

970
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
generically understood

971
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
and good.

972
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
We're also going to be

973
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
adding tempering stats.

974
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,000
We're open to really

975
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
adding whatever we want

976
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
that makes a unique

977
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,000
fit the fantasy.

978
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
So, as an example here,

979
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,000
you know,

980
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
a lot of two-hand weapon

981
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
uniques have a problem

982
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,000
where they're all

983
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
basically competing

984
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
against bonus projectiles

985
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,000
as an affix

986
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
because you can just

987
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
temper that onto your

988
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
weapons, right?

989
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So, when it comes

990
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,000
to those kind of

991
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
situations,

992
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
we'll just slap

993
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
the bonus projectiles

994
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,000
on that unique

995
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
and now, you know,

996
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
it's no longer

997
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
competing in that way

998
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
or we have to kind of

999
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
dance around it.

1000
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
We can just put it.

1001
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,000
We're also open

1002
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
to the idea, by the way,

1003
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
of breaking slot restrictions

1004
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
kind of like we did

1005
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
in Season 2

1006
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
so you can have

1007
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
bonus projectiles

1008
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,000
or other things

1009
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
on other slots.

1010
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know, like uniques

1011
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
are where we get

1012
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
to play a little bit

1013
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and just really make

1014
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
something thematic

1015
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and cool

1016
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and build defining

1017
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
and so they have

1018
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,000
less restrictions

1019
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
than everything else.

1020
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And the other one

1021
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,000
is we're updating

1022
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
the stat power levels

1023
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
and the effects.

1024
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
So, the idea here

1025
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,000
that we're thinking

1026
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
and this is particularly

1027
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
nuancy when it comes

1028
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:04,000
to generic uniques

1029
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
but stats that kind

1030
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
of fit the theme

1031
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
or the fantasy

1032
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,000
of the unique

1033
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
are going to be

1034
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
like way stronger

1035
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
than your normal stats,

1036
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,000
right?

1037
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So, as an example,

1038
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
if you have a unique

1039
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,000
that's targeting

1040
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
fire damage,

1041
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
maybe it's like a meteor

1042
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
or a firewall

1043
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
and the sorcerer

1044
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
or whatever it may be,

1045
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
you know, that plus

1046
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
fire damage can be

1047
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
juiced up to be

1048
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,000
really, really high

1049
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
but stats that are

1050
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
more like generically good

1051
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
like, you know,

1052
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I don't know,

1053
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
attack speed,

1054
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
max life, resist all,

1055
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
those ones aren't

1056
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
going to be juiced

1057
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
unless it fits

1058
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
the theme of the unique

1059
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
really well, right?

1060
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So, we have an example

1061
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
here of one that

1062
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,000
has been a problem

1063
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
for us in the past

1064
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and I kind of want

1065
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,000
to go through

1066
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
how we would think

1067
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,000
about it.

1068
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm not going to say

1069
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,000
exactly what we're

1070
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
going to do here

1071
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
to T'Bolt's Will

1072
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
but kind of give you

1073
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
our thought process, right?

1074
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
So, T'Bolt's Will,

1075
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
as many of you know

1076
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
in previous seasons

1077
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
was kind of a problem

1078
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
where it just became

1079
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,000
best in slot

1080
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
for almost every build.

1081
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
You know,

1082
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
the famous line we say

1083
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
is there was damage

1084
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
on pants which was

1085
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
impossible to get

1086
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
almost anywhere else

1087
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,000
in the game

1088
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
and it turned out

1089
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
damage on pants

1090
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
was really, really good,

1091
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,000
right?

1092
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,000
It also gave you

1093
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
damage reduction,

1094
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
one of the best stats

1095
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,000
in the game

1096
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
and then it also gave you

1097
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,000
a bunch of,

1098
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
it also solved resource

1099
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
in many ways for you

1100
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
as well, right?

1101
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,000
It gave you a bunch

1102
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
of resource

1103
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,000
whenever you became

1104
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
unstoppable which wasn't

1105
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,000
too hard to do

1106
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
so it was doing

1107
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
a lot of things at once.

1108
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It gave you

1109
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
a very unique effect

1110
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
with putting damage

1111
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,000
on a slot that you

1112
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
don't get it.

1113
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
It also gave you

1114
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,000
resource which is

1115
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
something that every

1116
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
class wants very heavily.

1117
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And Adam,

1118
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
it gave you

1119
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
three extra potions.

1120
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And three extra potions!

1121
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Yes.

1122
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Now that one,

1123
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
you know,

1124
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,000
that's alright.

1125
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,000
But yeah,

1126
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
so, you know,

1127
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,000
the way that we would

1128
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
tackle this one

1129
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
to give you an idea

1130
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,000
is like,

1131
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,000
you know,

1132
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
we either would

1133
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
kind of pick,

1134
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,000
you know,

1135
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,000
do we want to focus

1136
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
this on the damage

1137
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,000
aspect that it's

1138
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
damage on a

1139
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
non-damage slot

1140
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
or maybe we focus

1141
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,000
on the resource

1142
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
aspect and like

1143
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
double down on that

1144
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and make that

1145
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:46,000
really powerful

1146
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
and really cool

1147
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
or we do like

1148
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,000
a little bit of both

1149
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
but if we do both

1150
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
then it's not going

1151
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
to give you the

1152
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
defenses that another

1153
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
pants slot would give,

1154
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,000
right?

1155
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Basically,

1156
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,000
in our mind,

1157
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
we'd be like,

1158
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
we want to give the

1159
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
minimum amount of defense

1160
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,000
where it's not just

1161
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
like a trash item

1162
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
because it has nothing

1163
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
but then after that

1164
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
not so much

1165
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and you're going to

1166
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
have to solve your

1167
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
defenses in other slots

1168
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,000
or somewhere else

1169
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
to justify getting

1170
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
the damage on this slot

1171
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,000
is how we would

1172
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
think about it,

1173
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,000
right?

1174
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And so we're having

1175
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
a lot of conversations

1176
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,000
now.

1177
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I don't think we're

1178
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,000
going to nail

1179
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
every single item

1180
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
perfectly in this

1181
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,000
first pass

1182
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
so we're really

1183
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
looking for feedback

1184
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,000
when you,

1185
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
you know,

1186
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
jump into season five

1187
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,000
and beyond

1188
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
and we'll be

1189
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
adjusting them

1190
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,000
but I want to

1191
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
give you an idea

1192
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,000
of what we're doing

1193
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
and kind of what

1194
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
we're thinking

1195
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and targeting with this.

1196
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,000
So I think we can

1197
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,000
move on.

1198
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So Mythic Uniques

1199
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
are getting a

1200
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,000
facelift here.

1201
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So lots of updates

1202
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,000
here.

1203
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Mythic Uniques are

1204
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
now going to be

1205
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
truly Mythic.

1206
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:33,000
They're getting a

1207
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
new color beam

1208
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,000
when they drop

1209
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
on the ground.

1210
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
They're coming out

1211
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
with an awesome new

1212
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,000
sound that you're

1213
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
going to hear

1214
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:38,000
in a little bit.

1215
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
We've got a new

1216
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
item UI that you

1217
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,000
can see so they

1218
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
have a different color.

1219
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,000
They really are

1220
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
going to look and

1221
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
feel like the special

1222
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:45,000
items that they are.

1223
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And we have a video

1224
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
here to show you

1225
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,000
the sound and what

1226
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
it looks like on

1227
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,000
the ground.

1228
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So you can see

1229
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
here this beam

1230
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
looks very different

1231
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
than anything else.

1232
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Isn't that sound,

1233
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
that echoey sound,

1234
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I love it.

1235
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Sounds like a...

1236
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I don't know,

1237
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
it sounds like

1238
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
you're murdering

1239
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:01,000
a bunch of

1240
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
church organs

1241
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
or something like that.

1242
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
It's just crazy.

1243
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
But yeah,

1244
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,000
so when this thing

1245
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
drops,

1246
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,000
you're definitely

1247
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
going to know

1248
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
when you've got one.

1249
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
No more sifting

1250
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,000
through your Uniques

1251
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
to see if it's

1252
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
actually one of the

1253
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Mythics.

1254
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
You'll know right away.

1255
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:14,000
So we're really

1256
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
excited about this.

1257
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Super happy it was

1258
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,000
able to get in.

1259
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
All right,

1260
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
and last but not least,

1261
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,000
let's talk about

1262
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
class updates.

1263
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I'm going to cover

1264
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
some generic things

1265
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
across all classes

1266
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and then go through

1267
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
a little bit of each one.

1268
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Again,

1269
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
this is not going to be

1270
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
nearly close to

1271
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
everything that we're

1272
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,000
doing,

1273
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
just a little taste

1274
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
to teaser for what

1275
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,000
you can expect to see.

1276
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Let's start with

1277
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
things across all classes.

1278
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
One systemic update

1279
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
we're doing to the game

1280
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
is invulnerability skills

1281
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
are now going to start

1282
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
their cooldown

1283
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
when the invulnerability

1284
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
ends instead of

1285
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
when the skill begins.

1286
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
This is really to

1287
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,000
prevent things like

1288
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
infinite invulnerability

1289
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
and really to open up

1290
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
design space for us

1291
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
on the team

1292
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
because now we can be

1293
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,000
more comfortable

1294
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
adding things like

1295
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
invulnerable duration

1296
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
to skills or

1297
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
cooldown reduction

1298
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
more liberally

1299
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
and things like that

1300
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:56,000
where we don't have

1301
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
to worry about this.

1302
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
This is very similar

1303
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
to what our previous

1304
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,000
games have done

1305
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
and some other games do

1306
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
and we think it'll be

1307
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
a good fit here.

1308
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,000
The idea isn't really

1309
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
to make it that you

1310
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
can't be invulnerable

1311
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
very often.

1312
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It's just to prevent

1313
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
100% uptime

1314
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
where you actually

1315
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
break down the combat

1316
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
of the game

1317
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
and you're not interacting

1318
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:13,000
with enemies anymore.

1319
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
The next one is

1320
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
we reviewed monster CC

1321
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and we generally

1322
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
reduced the CC duration

1323
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,000
and frequency

1324
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
across the board

1325
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
so if you were

1326
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
frustrated by getting

1327
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
frozen for a million

1328
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
years and then dying

1329
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
that'll happen

1330
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
much less often

1331
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and also to help

1332
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
with this

1333
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
potions can be used

1334
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
while CC'd

1335
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,000
even while you're

1336
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
stunned.

1337
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So while you're

1338
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
frozen standing there

1339
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
and everybody's around

1340
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,000
you trying to kill you

1341
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
you can at least

1342
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
spam potion a little bit

1343
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
and maybe survive

1344
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:37,000
sometimes.

1345
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Next one we've got

1346
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,000
some bug fixes.

1347
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
These are some of the

1348
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
notable ones.

1349
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
We do have more

1350
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
coming in but these

1351
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,000
are the ones I wanted

1352
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
to call out.

1353
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Rogue Victimized is no

1354
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,000
longer going to be

1355
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
double dipping on its

1356
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
damage which was

1357
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
resulting in a lot

1358
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,000
more multiplicative

1359
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
or a lot more damage

1360
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
really than it was

1361
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,000
supposed to have.

1362
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Damage over time

1363
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,000
effects were getting

1364
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
double the amount of

1365
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
percent damage that

1366
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
they were supposed to

1367
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and Skeleton Reapers

1368
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
were getting both

1369
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,000
book of the dead bonuses

1370
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
when the second option

1371
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
was selected.

1372
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And again this is

1373
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
just a little bit of

1374
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
a preview but we have

1375
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
other bug fixes coming

1376
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,000
but these are some of

1377
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
the bigger ones we

1378
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
want to call out.

1379
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
All right now let's

1380
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
get to the classes.

1381
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So Barbarian they have

1382
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
a new unique coming

1383
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
in.

1384
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
This is the Unbroken

1385
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Chain.

1386
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,000
This is for you

1387
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
support Barbarians or

1388
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
really just more

1389
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
defensively oriented

1390
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
ones.

1391
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Basically what this is

1392
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
going to do is create a

1393
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:24,000
connection between

1394
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Steel Grasp and

1395
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Iron Maelstrom where

1396
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
you'll be able to cast

1397
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Iron Maelstrom a lot

1398
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
more often as you use

1399
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Steel Grasp.

1400
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And also enemies

1401
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,000
damaged by our

1402
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Maelstrom are going

1403
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
to be doing less

1404
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
damage for a little

1405
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,000
while.

1406
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So the idea here is

1407
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
you could debuff

1408
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
enemies, debuff those

1409
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
bosses and make them

1410
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
do less damage to you

1411
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
so you can survive

1412
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,000
better.

1413
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And next the Rogue

1414
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Flurry is going to be

1415
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,000
getting a lot of big

1416
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
updates.

1417
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
We updated the

1418
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
enhancement and both

1419
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,000
of their upgrades.

1420
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So you'll be able to

1421
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
see kind of a theme

1422
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,000
here going on.

1423
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Before you know you

1424
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
would damage a crowd

1425
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
control or a vulnerable

1426
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
enemy for the

1427
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:56,000
enhancement then you

1428
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
would heal.

1429
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Now when Flurry hits an

1430
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
enemy you can just make

1431
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,000
them vulnerable.

1432
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,000
So actually Flurry

1433
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
becomes a vulnerable

1434
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
generator here which is

1435
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
pretty exciting.

1436
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and it will also deal

1437
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
more damage as you

1438
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
hit vulnerable enemies.

1439
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It stacks up really

1440
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
high so the idea here

1441
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,000
is with Flurry builds

1442
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
you want to make

1443
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
everything vulnerable

1444
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
and then just keep

1445
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,000
whacking them with

1446
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Flurry and gain a

1447
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
bunch of damage.

1448
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And now Improved

1449
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Flurry is changing.

1450
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Before it was about

1451
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
vulnerable spreading

1452
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
but now Baseline you

1453
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
can just generate

1454
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:22,000
vulnerable so we

1455
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
don't need that

1456
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,000
anymore.

1457
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So now Improved

1458
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Flurry is going to

1459
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
actually give you a

1460
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,000
dash.

1461
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So now similar to

1462
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
things like the

1463
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Shred on the Druid

1464
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
you can kind of dash

1465
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
to your target and

1466
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
also every time you

1467
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
cast Flurry now it's

1468
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,000
going to heal you.

1469
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So it's going to be a

1470
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
lot more mobile a lot

1471
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,000
more awesome.

1472
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Very cool.

1473
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
And then last but not

1474
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
least to compete with

1475
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
a dash what could we

1476
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:43,000
do with Advanced

1477
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Flurry?

1478
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Well we can just add a

1479
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
stupid amount of

1480
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,000
damage and resource

1481
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
cost reduction.

1482
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So before you know

1483
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
you had to evade

1484
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
through an enemy and

1485
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
then do damage with

1486
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
one cast and stun

1487
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,000
enemies.

1488
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Now as you spam

1489
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Flurry it'll basically

1490
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
get a big damage

1491
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
bonus and its energy

1492
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
cost will go down

1493
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
which will let you be

1494
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,000
able to spam it even

1495
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
more often.

1496
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So the idea here is

1497
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,000
you just want to be

1498
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
using it over and

1499
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
over and over again

1500
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:03,000
and it'll get

1501
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
stronger and stronger

1502
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and ramp up pretty

1503
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
heavily as you go.

1504
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I'm excited for

1505
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Flurry rogues.

1506
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Yeah.

1507
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Very excited.

1508
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
They're going to be

1509
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,000
like little hummingbirds

1510
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
around bouncing around

1511
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and it's going to be

1512
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,000
great.

1513
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Yeah.

1514
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Ironically I'm playing

1515
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Flurry this season so

1516
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I'm always off by one.

1517
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Like I always play the

1518
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
thing and then like oh

1519
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
we're going to massively

1520
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
make it better next time

1521
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
but you know it's fine.

1522
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It's fine.

1523
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Everything's fine.

1524
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Next Druid.

1525
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Shepard's Aspect.

1526
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,000
We've gotten feedback

1527
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
from players now for a

1528
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,000
while now about how

1529
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
you know Shepard's Aspect

1530
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,000
kind of dominates the

1531
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
meta for Druids

1532
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
because you're basically

1533
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
both it's both not great

1534
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
from a design and a

1535
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,000
balanced perspective.

1536
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
On the design side you

1537
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
know we're telling you

1538
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
to put companions on

1539
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
your bar and then

1540
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,000
they're actually just

1541
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
buffing you.

1542
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So you know we make

1543
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
this companion build

1544
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
fantasy but it's

1545
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
actually just making the

1546
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
player better.

1547
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And then on the power

1548
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
side you know you're

1549
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
just putting you're

1550
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
basically just slotting

1551
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
three skills on your

1552
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
bar with your companions

1553
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and then not really

1554
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
caring about buffing

1555
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:54,000
them or using them

1556
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
because they're just

1557
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,000
kind of there as

1558
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
proxies to make you

1559
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,000
better.

1560
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
So we've changed it now

1561
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,000
where you know

1562
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
basically it's going to

1563
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
be about the companions.

1564
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
So your companion skills

1565
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
are just going to deal

1566
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
damage for every

1567
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
companion that you have.

1568
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
So you know the bigger

1569
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
your zoo the better

1570
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,000
your zoo is going to

1571
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
perform.

1572
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And to compensate

1573
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
players we're doing

1574
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
some pretty massive

1575
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
buffs to Druid skills

1576
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
baseline to compensate.

1577
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
So you know your skills

1578
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
are just going to be

1579
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
getting that damage

1580
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
baseline and in many

1581
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:19,000
cases a little bit more.

1582
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
So you can check that

1583
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
out when you see the

1584
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
PTR notes or yeah the

1585
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
PTR patch notes after

1586
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,000
this.

1587
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
But we basically just

1588
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
buffed everything across

1589
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
the board and made it

1590
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
so that Shepherds isn't

1591
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
required anymore.

1592
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Next for the Sorceress

1593
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
this is Axial Conduit.

1594
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I'm really excited

1595
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
about this unique.

1596
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
This is your Chain

1597
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Lightning unique.

1598
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
So Chain Lightning

1599
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:39,000
builds.

1600
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
You finally have a unique

1601
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
that really talks to you.

1602
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And you can see here

1603
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
kind of our stats and

1604
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
that new philosophy I

1605
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
told you about.

1606
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
You have a chance to

1607
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
double cast Chain

1608
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Lightning on pants

1609
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
instead of just a

1610
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:49,000
weapon.

1611
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So that's pretty cool.

1612
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
So basically the way

1613
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
that this works we're

1614
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
going to have a video

1615
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,000
but I'm going to explain

1616
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
to you how this works

1617
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
because it actually

1618
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,000
changes your skill

1619
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
pretty significantly.

1620
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
So now when you

1621
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,000
cast Chain Lightning

1622
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
the way it's going to

1623
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
work is it's going to

1624
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,000
cast and bounce on

1625
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
enemies just like

1626
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
before but then it's

1627
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
going to come back to

1628
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
you and orbit you a

1629
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,000
little bit.

1630
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And then it's going to

1631
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
go out and hit another

1632
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
enemy and then come

1633
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,000
back to you in orbit

1634
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and then come out and

1635
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
go out and do another

1636
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,000
enemy and come back.

1637
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:12,000
It's going to do that

1638
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
back and forth a few

1639
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
times and every time it

1640
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,000
comes back to you it's

1641
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
going to drain some of

1642
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
your mana.

1643
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And after it drains so

1644
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
much mana after coming

1645
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
back ten times the bolt

1646
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
is actually going to

1647
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
explode for a ridiculous

1648
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
amount of lightning damage

1649
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,000
on enemies.

1650
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So there's a mini game

1651
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
here where basically

1652
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
oh and by the way you

1653
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
can cast multiple Chain

1654
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Lightning's when this is

1655
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
out.

1656
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You're basically going to

1657
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
be like running a

1658
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
gambit here and the

1659
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
mini game is you want to

1660
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
stack as much resource

1661
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
regeneration as you can

1662
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
so that your lightning

1663
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
bolts can survive being

1664
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
drained over and over

1665
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
and bouncing everywhere

1666
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
so they can last to

1667
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
their explosion and do a

1668
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
ton of damage to

1669
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,000
enemies.

1670
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
One thing I want to

1671
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:47,000
call out here also is

1672
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
that because it drains

1673
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
mana resource cost

1674
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
reduction won't work on

1675
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:51,000
that drain.

1676
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
You're actually going to

1677
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
want to focus on gaining

1678
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
resource which is a

1679
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,000
little bit different and

1680
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
kind of makes us build a

1681
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
little special I think

1682
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
and unique compared to

1683
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
other resource builds

1684
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
based around resource.

1685
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
So I like to see it in

1686
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:04,000
action here.

1687
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
So you'll see what one

1688
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
cast looks like and then

1689
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I think we'll see what it

1690
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
looks like when you spam

1691
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:08,000
it.

1692
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So you can see here it

1693
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
circles you, goes and

1694
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
hits enemies, circles you,

1695
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
goes and hits enemies and

1696
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,000
then it does a big

1697
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
explosion at the end that

1698
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
we've tuned to damage to

1699
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
be pretty high.

1700
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,000
See there?

1701
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:19,000
So then it explodes.

1702
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Oh wait.

1703
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Oh do we have one where it

1704
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
casts a bunch of times?

1705
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Maybe we don't.

1706
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Oh there we go.

1707
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
There we go.

1708
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
So see here?

1709
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
You can see that as you

1710
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
go it will keep going,

1711
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
going, going and they

1712
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
explode a bunch of times.

1713
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Another thing I want to

1714
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
point out is if you're

1715
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
hugging enemies in melee

1716
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
range as it's circling you

1717
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
it will also hit enemies.

1718
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
So you now have a way to

1719
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
really maximize your

1720
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
damage by hugging bosses

1721
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
and such.

1722
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
The damage goes way up.

1723
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So next, last but not

1724
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
least, the Necromancer.

1725
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So we got some feedback.

1726
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
We've had this for a while

1727
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
and put this on the team

1728
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
where, you know, the

1729
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
golem we really love.

1730
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
You know, we love our

1731
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
golem, our golem boys.

1732
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And, you know, but

1733
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,000
sometimes it can be

1734
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
frustrating where you tell

1735
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
the golem to go somewhere

1736
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
and then he kind of takes

1737
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
a while to lug his butt

1738
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
over there and do his

1739
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
slam or his shout or

1740
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
whatever and, you know,

1741
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
things can get in the way.

1742
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And so we've kind of upgraded

1743
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
him a little bit.

1744
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I'll let the video speak

1745
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
for himself here.

1746
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
But so now you can see

1747
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
your golem will Hulk smash

1748
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
and just jump on enemies

1749
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
and slam them down.

1750
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So this will work with all

1751
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
of your golem types, by the

1752
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
way, not just the iron golem.

1753
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
But now your golem is going

1754
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
to leap to the area that you

1755
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
tell him to go and then

1756
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
cast his ability.

1757
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
So we're really excited about

1758
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,000
this.

1759
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Shout out to Charles Dunn

1760
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
who got this change in and

1761
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
our animators who helped

1762
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,000
us out.

1763
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
But we're really pumped for

1764
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,000
it.

1765
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It looks amazing.

1766
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yeah.

1767
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
So those were the class

1768
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
and balance changes.

1769
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And I know we jumped a

1770
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,000
slide there.

1771
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
How dare you, production?

1772
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,000
No.

1773
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
But we are, as they wave

1774
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
to me like, I'm sorry.

1775
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We do want to go into some

1776
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
quality of life updates.

1777
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
We do have a significant

1778
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
amount of quality of life

1779
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
updates that we do want to

1780
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
go through that will be

1781
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
available in season five.

1782
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
And you guys will actually

1783
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
be able to check this out

1784
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
in the PTR.

1785
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
So now we can go to the

1786
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
next slide where we do

1787
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
want to talk about some

1788
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Helltide and Whisper

1789
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
updates specifically.

1790
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
So I know this has been

1791
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
kind of, at least it's been

1792
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
a pain point for me and I've

1793
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
heard it's been a pain

1794
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
point for others, is that

1795
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
as you guys are going

1796
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
through Helltide, there

1797
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
are Whisper objectives within

1798
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
there to help you with your

1799
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
progression on your

1800
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Whisper bar.

1801
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But the issue with the

1802
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
ones in Helltide is that

1803
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
it can sometimes take quite a

1804
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
while to do.

1805
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And, you know, sometimes

1806
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
players would have to leave

1807
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
the Helltide to go to

1808
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
another area to complete

1809
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
some of these Whisper

1810
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,000
objectives.

1811
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
So we are optimizing this to

1812
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
ensure that they don't take

1813
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
nearly as much time.

1814
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
The ideal goal is to get a

1815
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
bunch of value within those

1816
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
15 minutes and to

1817
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
potentially end up getting a

1818
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
full entire Whisper 10-point

1819
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
bar within 15 minutes in one

1820
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Helltide 7.

1821
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Full Whisper every Helltide.

1822
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
So that would be, it would be

1823
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
a huge help because I know,

1824
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
at least for me, I've always

1825
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
had to, like, kind of leave a

1826
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Helltide and try to, you

1827
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
know, knock some of that out.

1828
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
It will especially help for

1829
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
players that are looking for

1830
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
additional gold because

1831
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Whisper Caches have always

1832
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
been great sources of gold.

1833
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And now, as Adam mentioned,

1834
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
you can also use Whisper Caches

1835
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
to target farm.

1836
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,000
To target farm.

1837
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
So it's keeping things more

1838
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
optimized for players, which

1839
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
we know will be way better

1840
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,000
there.

1841
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
The next thing we do want to

1842
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
talk about is also Baneful

1843
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Hearts.

1844
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I know this may not sound like

1845
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
a huge quality of life thing

1846
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
or a buff of any sort, but

1847
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
we have noticed that players

1848
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
have had a lot of Baneful

1849
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Hearts within their inventory.

1850
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
We do want to make these a

1851
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
little bit more valuable so

1852
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
they won't drop as

1853
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
frequently.

1854
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
We know that players will

1855
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
still have a significant

1856
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
amount, but maybe not

1857
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
hundreds and hundreds like

1858
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
some people have within

1859
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
their inventory.

1860
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
But players should not have

1861
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
any type of issues regarding

1862
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
having a ton of these

1863
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Baneful Hearts.

1864
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
But we are tweaking the

1865
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
drop rate because they were

1866
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
dropping a little too much

1867
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,000
there.

1868
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Tempering.

1869
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Yeah.

1870
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
The very, very, I guess,

1871
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
like, brought up topic.

1872
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Well, like.

1873
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Yeah.

1874
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
People like to worry about

1875
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,000
tempering.

1876
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
It's pretty popular.

1877
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Yeah.

1878
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,000
So I want to take a minute to

1879
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
talk about tempering and kind

1880
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
of how the design team sees

1881
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
it and kind of what we're

1882
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
happy with, what we think

1883
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
could be better, and some

1884
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
adjustments we'll be making

1885
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,000
in Season 5.

1886
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
So first high level, kind of

1887
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
how we see tempering.

1888
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
We really think that it's

1889
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
important that items have an

1890
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
endpoint where players know

1891
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
kind of that the item is

1892
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
done and that they're not

1893
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
hoarding lots of them forever

1894
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
on the chance that they can

1895
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
all be good.

1896
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Right?

1897
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
One of the big key goals of

1898
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Season 4 was that we didn't

1899
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
want you saving a million

1900
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
items in your stash space.

1901
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And while we know that, you

1902
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
know, bricking an item never

1903
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
feels great, we do need that

1904
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,000
to be something that's

1905
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
possible to do in the game so

1906
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
that you know when the

1907
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
journey is done and you're not

1908
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
just holding on to an item

1909
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,000
forever.

1910
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
So that part we actually think

1911
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
is working very well where,

1912
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
you know, an item is done and

1913
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
you try and go get another

1914
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,000
one.

1915
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
And so you're always interested

1916
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
in items and trying to, you

1917
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
know, have that game loop go

1918
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
in the game indefinitely.

1919
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Or until you feel like your

1920
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
character is Maxonic's power.

1921
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
But we do agree with players

1922
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
that, you know, the RNG right

1923
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
now is like completely out of

1924
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
their hands, which doesn't

1925
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,000
really feel great.

1926
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
You know, you get so many

1927
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
tries basically to roll and

1928
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
then that's kind of it and

1929
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
you're done and it doesn't

1930
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,000
feel great.

1931
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So we're looking at ways in the

1932
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
future for players to have

1933
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
more control over that RNG so

1934
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
that, you know, you have more

1935
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
ways to maybe manipulate the

1936
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
tempering or get the odds in

1937
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
your favor and do other

1938
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
things like that.

1939
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
One update that's going to be

1940
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
coming in Season 5, it won't

1941
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
be in the PTR, but as we're

1942
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
targeting for launch, is that,

1943
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
you know, we've got a lot of

1944
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
feedback that it feels so bad

1945
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,000
when, you know, you get that

1946
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
like triple greater affix and

1947
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,000
it has the same number of

1948
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
rolls and then you brick it

1949
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
and then you have to try and

1950
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
go get another one.

1951
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
So in Season 5, to help with

1952
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
this, you know, as your item

1953
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
gets better basically that you

1954
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
find, you're going to have

1955
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
more chances to temper it.

1956
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
So a much better chance to

1957
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
get the one that you want.

1958
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Basically, the way it'll work

1959
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,000
is you're going to basically

1960
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
get one extra roll per

1961
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
greater affix that you have.

1962
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:03,000
So, you know, you have one

1963
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
greater affix, one roll, three,

1964
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,000
three rolls.

1965
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
And again, just to clarify,

1966
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
this is not in the PTR, but it

1967
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
will be in for the launch of

1968
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Season 5 in itself.

1969
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And again, just to reiterate,

1970
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
we are still looking at ways to

1971
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
help out that experience within

1972
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
tempering, as we've noted.

1973
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
We agree with players that it

1974
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
doesn't always feel great.

1975
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And so you guys should expect to

1976
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
hear more updates to tempering

1977
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
after we get through Season 5,

1978
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:29,000
for sure.

1979
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Yeah.

1980
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
All right.

1981
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Next up, weapons.

1982
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yeah.

1983
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
So I'll talk about this one a

1984
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,000
little bit.

1985
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,000
We took a look at...

1986
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Look at this chart.

1987
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Yeah, this chart.

1988
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
We took a look at inherent

1989
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
affixes on weapons, and we

1990
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
found that, you know, a lot of

1991
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
inherent affixes, like damage to

1992
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
distant or some other ones,

1993
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
were a little too conditional

1994
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
and didn't get the update,

1995
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
you know, in Season 4 that we

1996
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,000
wanted.

1997
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
So we went back and made them

1998
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
a little bit more generically

1999
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
useful and better across more

2000
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,000
builds.

2001
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
So we have a little chart here,

2002
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
but you can see kind of this is

2003
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
going to be the new inherent

2004
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
affixes on all the different

2005
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
weapon types.

2006
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So we've made quite a few

2007
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
adjustments here.

2008
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
You know, as an example,

2009
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
you know, vulnerable damage is

2010
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
on bows and dot damage is on

2011
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
axes, which I believe vulnerable

2012
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
on bows is new.

2013
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
But yeah, so we made quite a few

2014
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
updates.

2015
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
We basically just looked at the

2016
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
matricy of everything and kind

2017
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
of adjusted it to see what

2018
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
makes sense.

2019
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
So basically you're just going to

2020
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
have, you know, things that

2021
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
actually impact your builds much

2022
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
more often on the weapons that

2023
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
you want.

2024
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And as another result of this

2025
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
update, we are also looking at

2026
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
what weapons classes can use.

2027
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And we updated them a little

2028
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
bit to try and, you know, let

2029
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
more classes use more weapons.

2030
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
We want players to be able to

2031
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
create interesting builds, play

2032
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,000
the way that we want.

2033
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And so we want to open up these

2034
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
things as much as we can in our

2035
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,000
designs.

2036
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So now Druids are going to be

2037
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
able to use two-hand pull arms,

2038
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
one-hand swords, and daggers.

2039
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Sorceresses are going to be able

2040
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
to use one-hand swords and

2041
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,000
maces.

2042
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And Necromancers are going to be

2043
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
able to use, I think it's

2044
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
maces and axes, actually.

2045
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Yeah.

2046
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Despite this Necromancer

2047
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
picture right here that is not

2048
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
using...

2049
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Well, it's using a two-handed

2050
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
sword, but you can already use a

2051
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
two-handed sword, but not using a...

2052
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Yeah.

2053
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
And the Necromancer here, I know

2054
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
it's supposed to say all maces and

2055
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
axes as opposed to all swords.

2056
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
But yeah, basically we're going to

2057
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
be opening up these classes to use

2058
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
more weapon types.

2059
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And then also some of the uniques

2060
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
are going to be updated for the

2061
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
classes as well.

2062
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
So the Butcher's Cleaver can now be

2063
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
used for Necros.

2064
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Necromancer and Sorcerers can use

2065
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Doombriner and Azure Wrath now.

2066
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yeah, Sorcerers can use Azure

2067
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Wrath, kind of like D2.

2068
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Yep.

2069
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Fits their theme very well too.

2070
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
So I think that'll be pretty cool.

2071
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Some additional quality of life

2072
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
updates.

2073
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Now we're going to talk about some

2074
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,000
endgame bosses.

2075
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
As I have experienced, as Adam has

2076
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
experienced earlier, as he mentioned

2077
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
in the stream, we are making changes

2078
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
to the Beast and Ice.

2079
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
You guys will no longer have to make

2080
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
a sigil to summon the Beast and Ice.

2081
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Which is a huge quality of life

2082
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
update.

2083
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
The Beast will now live in a

2084
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
standard dungeon.

2085
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
The crawl to get to the Beast and

2086
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Ice is much, much shorter now.

2087
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
It's going to be more similar to

2088
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
what we've seen with some of the

2089
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
other endgame bosses.

2090
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And then at the same time, Eternal

2091
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
players that have maybe already

2092
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
built out some of these sigils.

2093
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
We made sure to keep you in mind so

2094
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
you can still use those sigils to

2095
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
fight the boss.

2096
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
You won't need summoning materials.

2097
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
You can just use the sigil right there

2098
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
in the boss room in itself.

2099
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
And this no longer requires sigil dust

2100
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
to actually summon the Beast and

2101
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Ice.

2102
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So some big changes to the Beast and

2103
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Ice to help out that whole entire

2104
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
feel, especially when you're really

2105
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
target farming the Beast and Ice.

2106
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Sometimes it was kind of brutal to

2107
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
have to go through the whole entire

2108
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
dungeon each and every time.

2109
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
You're telling me so many times.

2110
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Yeah.

2111
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
So next we have Varshan.

2112
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Varshan, the body parts are pretty

2113
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
much being reduced to one.

2114
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I know it was eating up a lot of

2115
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
inventory space.

2116
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
It was kind of hard to manage at

2117
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
times and everything.

2118
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So we're optimizing this, making this

2119
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
better.

2120
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So now you'll just need one body part

2121
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
to essentially summon Varshan going

2122
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
forward starting with Season 5.

2123
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And one big thing that we're going to

2124
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
call out here before, and this is

2125
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
kind of like the cherry on top.

2126
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
We should, let's actually just play

2127
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
the clip and see if people actually

2128
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
notice it.

2129
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
And if not, then we'll call it out.

2130
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
What could be different this time?

2131
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Poor Durial.

2132
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah.

2133
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Mythic Unique maybe?

2134
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
No, that's not it.

2135
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Oh.

2136
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Good gear though.

2137
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

2138
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
But something that is interesting here

2139
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
is the cauldron has reappeared.

2140
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
You can just resummon him again.

2141
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And there's the altar right there.

2142
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You can now resummon all the endgame

2143
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
bosses without needing to run out of

2144
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
the dungeon.

2145
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Reset the thing.

2146
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And reset the dungeon.

2147
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
So this will help a whole lot.

2148
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It will make things way better in terms

2149
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
of like optimizing when you're, for

2150
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
time and everything.

2151
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Especially when you're a party and

2152
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
you're like, everyone leave the

2153
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
dungeon so I can reset and stuff like

2154
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
that.

2155
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Now you'll be able to do that

2156
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
immediately for all the endgame

2157
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,000
bosses.

2158
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Super convenient.

2159
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Which is a huge, huge feature I know

2160
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
that players have been asking for.

2161
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
So that will be also incorporated

2162
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
into Season 5.

2163
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
So lots and lots of changes for

2164
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Season 5.

2165
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
One other thing.

2166
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I did want to call out regarding

2167
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
tempering because, just to clarify,

2168
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
because we've got some people going

2169
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
like, oh, I don't understand like the

2170
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
greater affix stuff like in terms of

2171
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,000
additional roles.

2172
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
If you have a one star greater affix,

2173
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
you'll get one additional role.

2174
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
If you have like a three star or four

2175
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
star or something, you would get three

2176
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
or four pending the amount of stars

2177
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
that you actually specifically have

2178
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
on your item.

2179
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Yeah, I think it goes up to three.

2180
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Yeah, three.

2181
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Three, sorry.

2182
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Four is more specific.

2183
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Four is unique.

2184
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Four is unique.

2185
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Yeah.

2186
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Yeah.

2187
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
If thinking about razor plate or

2188
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
something like that.

2189
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
But the other thing that I did want to

2190
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
call out is that this is actually going

2191
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
to be retroactive.

2192
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So for players that still have maybe an item

2193
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
that they may have potentially bricked

2194
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
and it's sitting in their stash, you know,

2195
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
just for like memento purposes or anything

2196
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,000
like that.

2197
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Yeah, eternal or whatever.

2198
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Yeah.

2199
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
When your character does move to eternal,

2200
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
if it was a greater affix, like a three star

2201
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
greater affix or something like that,

2202
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
you will end up getting those three additional

2203
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
roles afterwards.

2204
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
So that will appear after these changes

2205
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
actually are implemented with the start

2206
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
of season five.

2207
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
It'll just be on your internal character,

2208
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
obviously, because your seasonal character

2209
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
will move to eternal.

2210
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
As I fix my earpiece, that's like falling out.

2211
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Oh no.

2212
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
But one other thing I did want to call out

2213
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
as well for season five, we have some really

2214
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
big like accessibility options that are being

2215
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
added to the actual game.

2216
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And we really, really need some testing on this

2217
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
in the season five PTR.

2218
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
This is actually called out in our blog.

2219
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
We'd really love if players can actually check

2220
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
them out, test them out, provide feedback.

2221
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I will note, we aren't planning, despite it

2222
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
being in the season five PTR, we aren't planning

2223
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
on these features actually launching with season five.

2224
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
We really want to take the feedback, make them,

2225
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
you know, better for when they are ready.

2226
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
And right now, I think that the plan would be

2227
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
that they would be ready for season six.

2228
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
But it's important for us to be able to get

2229
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,000
that feedback.

2230
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So we really need people to actually test out

2231
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
these specific features.

2232
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
We have like an auto pin feature,

2233
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
we have a compass feature, and then we have

2234
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
like an audio navigation assistance feature

2235
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
that is coming within some of these accessibility

2236
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
features for season five.

2237
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
So really important for people to kind of like

2238
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
jump in, check it out, give us feedback,

2239
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and then you'll see those in season six

2240
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
after the PTR is kind of over.

2241
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
But that is kind of like a huge wrap up of all the stuff

2242
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
that is coming for the season five PTR

2243
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
and even a little bit more of even some of the stuff

2244
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
for season five itself.

2245
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
We do want to take some questions,

2246
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
and we still have Dan on the line

2247
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
from the burning hells of Albany

2248
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
to answer any questions that we may have.

2249
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But I know we have a question specifically teed up,

2250
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
so if you have questions, please ask them in Twitch chat,

2251
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
which is where we have live chat going on right now,

2252
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
and we will try to get through as many as possible.

2253
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Cool.

2254
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
But first question I believe we have is,

2255
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
because I teed up this question,

2256
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
are there any new class buffs coming to season five?

2257
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Specifically, if Adam can answer,

2258
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Druid and Sorceress, because I know,

2259
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
we hear you, everyone, about Druid and Sorceress.

2260
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I know we talked a little bit about it here,

2261
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
but if you can like expand on it a little.

2262
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2263
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Yes, there are new class buffs coming to season five,

2264
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
covered it a little bit.

2265
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I think one of the call out

2266
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
that people talk a lot about right now

2267
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
is how barbarians in particular are pretty strong,

2268
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
and then the classes that can't get

2269
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
as far as they can in the pit feels kind of bad.

2270
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
There's a lot to chew on there,

2271
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
but I think the short answer is,

2272
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
yes, we hear you,

2273
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
and we're going to be looking to beef these things up.

2274
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
We do have some specific ways

2275
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
that we want to be targeting these things,

2276
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
and there's a lot of history to it.

2277
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Barbarians in particular are tougher to balance.

2278
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I think I've talked about this on stream

2279
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
a little bit before of, you know,

2280
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
because of their arsenal system,

2281
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,000
they have more items.

2282
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
You know, any time that we mess with,

2283
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
and we've messed with like the underlying systems

2284
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
of the game very heavily in the last year, right?

2285
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Season two, we updated all the combat math,

2286
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
which of course impacts items,

2287
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
which impacts character power.

2288
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
We've updated in season four all of itemization,

2289
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
which obviously directly impacts

2290
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
the arsenal system very heavily.

2291
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
So when we do these large shakeups,

2292
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
it's a lot more difficult in a short amount of time

2293
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
to get everything, you know,

2294
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
exactly perfect of how the combinatorics

2295
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
of those effects are going to impact classes, right?

2296
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So that's one end of it.

2297
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Another end is what we're trying to do,

2298
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
and we started with this in season four,

2299
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
is we're looking at the other class mechanics,

2300
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
and we want to kind of beef them up

2301
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
and give them the treatment that we kind of gave

2302
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
with the necromancer in the Book of the Dead.

2303
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You know, in season four,

2304
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
we actually wanted to try this as an experiment,

2305
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
like, hey, you know, the Book of the Dead,

2306
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
the minions, the sacrifice bonuses,

2307
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
they're what really make necromancer

2308
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
feel really cool and special and unique.

2309
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
So we're going to, you know,

2310
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
try and catch that up, so to speak,

2311
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
to the arsenal system on the Barbarian,

2312
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
and not only just increase the numbers, right,

2313
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
because just increasing the numbers is kind of easy.

2314
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
We even did that in the mid-season patch.

2315
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
If you look at the Druid Boons,

2316
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
you know, we increased them by 50%,

2317
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
doubled them in many cases,

2318
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
but we think to really help solve that

2319
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
on a fantasy and even just a design perspective,

2320
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
we want to, like, overhaul

2321
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
and really look at these mechanics

2322
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
and make them way better

2323
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
and more thematic to classes.

2324
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
So we don't have anything to announce today

2325
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
for season five,

2326
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
but that's something more long-term

2327
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
that we're doing to help that problem in the future.

2328
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
In the short term,

2329
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
we are, you know, looking at, you know,

2330
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
fixing the issues with these various classes,

2331
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
buffing them up in different ways,

2332
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
you know, making different builds

2333
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,000
and other things viable

2334
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
and trying to keep that parity.

2335
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
We're also looking at, you know,

2336
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
bringing down the outliers of power

2337
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
with the Barbarian in different ways

2338
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
to make sure that they have more parity

2339
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
with other classes as well.

2340
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
But that's kind of our short and long-term vision

2341
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
of where we want this to be.

2342
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Awesome.

2343
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I know we have a question specifically,

2344
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
and this is something I've seen a few times

2345
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
regarding season five for Dan,

2346
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
because Infernal Hordes,

2347
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
people are seeing this gameplay

2348
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
and they're hearing about, like,

2349
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
okay, like, I can play it.

2350
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Can I play this on Eternal and Seasonal?

2351
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Can I play this?

2352
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Is this, like, an ongoing thing going forward?

2353
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Like, what can players expect, Dan?

2354
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Sure, yeah.

2355
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
So with season five,

2356
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
we wanted to build out the end game.

2357
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
And because we're building out the end game,

2358
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
we wanted to make sure that

2359
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
any of the end game things we're putting in

2360
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
are on both seasonal and eternal.

2361
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
And so in this PTR,

2362
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
you'll be able to test out

2363
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
the eternal version of Infernal Hordes.

2364
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And so any of the rewards you get from it,

2365
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:50,000
all that's eternal.

2366
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
So all players are going to benefit from it.

2367
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Awesome.

2368
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Yeah, so all players will benefit from it.

2369
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
And as Dan mentioned,

2370
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
it's a new end game feature.

2371
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
So it's, like, something that will be, you know,

2372
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
continuous beyond, you know,

2373
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
even season five is what we're looking at.

2374
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
So, yeah.

2375
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Players can expect to jump in Infernal Hordes

2376
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
going forward, which is pretty cool.

2377
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Yeah.

2378
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And, yeah, the feedback is going to be

2379
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
incredibly important during this PTR.

2380
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
As Dan mentioned beforehand,

2381
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
all the specific items

2382
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
that we're really hoping to get, you know,

2383
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
feedback on regarding, you know,

2384
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
how the boons feel,

2385
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
how the rewards feel,

2386
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
how the combat feels

2387
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
and the waves and stuff like that

2388
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
will be really important for us

2389
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
during this specific moment.

2390
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
What is the,

2391
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
this is another season five question,

2392
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
and hopefully you might be able

2393
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
to answer this, Dan.

2394
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
What is this from Lucky Luciano?

2395
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Shout out, Diablo partner.

2396
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
What is the equivalent pit level

2397
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
of the eighth difficulty

2398
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
of, like, the Infernal Hordes?

2399
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Pit level, I guess,

2400
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
or Nightmare Dungeon

2401
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
or monster level.

2402
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Yeah, you're making me do math here.

2403
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Yeah, we just adjusted pit levels.

2404
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Yeah, so tier, tier eight,

2405
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
tier eight of the Infernal Hordes

2406
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
is going to be equivalent

2407
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
to about monster level,

2408
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I think it's 180 to 200.

2409
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
So it goes up pretty high.

2410
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
That's pretty late.

2411
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Okay, nice.

2412
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Nice.

2413
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
So a difficult challenge for sure,

2414
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
which is good to hear.

2415
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
We have a question from Zapidas.

2416
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Man, you all need easier names,

2417
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I swear.

2418
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Do you foresee changes in grouping

2419
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
in the pit to allow group play

2420
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
to be more efficient?

2421
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
There will be changes.

2422
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
It won't be something present in PTR.

2423
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
We'll talk more about it

2424
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
at the Season 5 launch,

2425
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
but the team is very aware of it

2426
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
because we've heard about, like,

2427
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
hey, it's kind of not great

2428
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
to feel like I'm getting only 50%

2429
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
of the rewards associated

2430
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
when I'm in a group within a pit

2431
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
if I'm not the party leader specifically.

2432
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
So it's something that the team is taking in

2433
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
and we will have an update

2434
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
for players before Season 5

2435
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
and it will be live,

2436
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
whatever change we have,

2437
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
live in Season 5.

2438
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
So a question from,

2439
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
let's see,

2440
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I don't know.

2441
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Well, this one's easy.

2442
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Okay.

2443
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Robot Jomo.

2444
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
What's the team's philosophy

2445
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
on rate of power gain?

2446
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It seems that tempering,

2447
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
especially players,

2448
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
gain too much power too quickly,

2449
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
really removing the tension

2450
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
from the leveling up experience.

2451
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Any chance to add more friction

2452
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
to tempering,

2453
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
materials, costs, etc.?

2454
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Yeah.

2455
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
We have seen a little bit of this

2456
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
and heard this feedback ourselves.

2457
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
It's kind of going in two different ways here.

2458
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
So the leveling experience

2459
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
and then how tempering messes with it, right?

2460
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
The leveling experience,

2461
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
as people probably have seen,

2462
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
has been sped up quite a bit, right?

2463
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
We do want people to be able

2464
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
to kind of level quickly

2465
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
and get to the fun of the game

2466
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
as quickly as possible.

2467
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
So we do want them,

2468
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:51,000
you know,

2469
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
we don't want there to be

2470
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
a ton of friction.

2471
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Like, you know,

2472
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
when we first launched the game,

2473
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
we had the idea that, like,

2474
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
getting to level 100 alone

2475
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
was a big accomplishment, right?

2476
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And we've learned that, you know,

2477
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
players really want to, like,

2478
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
fulfill their power fantasies,

2479
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
get to the part where they're actually,

2480
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
like, incrementally increasing

2481
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
their character's power

2482
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:09,000
and finding things

2483
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
they'll use that power against.

2484
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And so they enjoy that endgame a lot

2485
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and we want to get them there

2486
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
in a reasonable amount of time.

2487
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
So that's the part that is like,

2488
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
you know, hey, you know,

2489
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
it's fine, level quicker,

2490
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
it's good, right?

2491
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
But then the other part is, like,

2492
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
tempering and kind of the tuning

2493
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:23,000
of the affixes.

2494
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
We have heard the feedback

2495
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
and kind of agree with it

2496
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,000
that, you know,

2497
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
the early tempering recipes

2498
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
are really, really strong, right?

2499
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
That was by design

2500
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
when we launched Season 4.

2501
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
One of the big kind of mandates

2502
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:36,000
to the team

2503
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
that we felt was important

2504
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
was we wanted, you know,

2505
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
before Season 4,

2506
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
we constantly got the feedback

2507
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
and knew it was true

2508
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
that, you know,

2509
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
your item stats

2510
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
weren't interesting enough

2511
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,000
and didn't matter enough

2512
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
and weren't very impactful

2513
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
and just didn't feel good, right?

2514
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
And so we very much, like,

2515
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
juice them up to be very strong

2516
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
and in this new tempering system

2517
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
that manipulates them,

2518
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
we made it very strong

2519
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
so that out the gate,

2520
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
our goal was

2521
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
that when you temper an item,

2522
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
you can really feel the damage.

2523
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
It wasn't like this incremental,

2524
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
oh, my damage goes up

2525
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
in, like, 10 different places

2526
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
here and there

2527
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
and now I'm strong.

2528
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,000
It was like,

2529
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
no, this one thing happened

2530
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:09,000
and you felt it

2531
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
and it was good

2532
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
and so we're going to,

2533
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,000
you know,

2534
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
try and walk that line.

2535
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
We're going to probably go

2536
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
a little more in between here

2537
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
where, you know,

2538
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
we do agree that the tempering

2539
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
is warping the early game experience

2540
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:19,000
too much

2541
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
to the point that it's like

2542
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
you pick up an item

2543
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
and you don't care about the stats

2544
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
because you just temper something on

2545
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
and it's, like, way better, right?

2546
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
So we don't want that

2547
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
but we do still want them

2548
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
to feel and be really impactful.

2549
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
So we have heard the feedback.

2550
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I don't remember,

2551
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
don't think we have huge adjustments

2552
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
in Season 5 right away

2553
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
but we are going to be looking

2554
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
at that leveling process

2555
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
and streaming and lining that

2556
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
quite a bit.

2557
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
We're having time

2558
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,000
and actually even talks

2559
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
about that right now

2560
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
with various members of the team.

2561
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
So it will be looked at.

2562
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Not tons will change

2563
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
in Season 5, though.

2564
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Awesome.

2565
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Question from Razzle Dazzle Daris.

2566
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Razzle Dazzle Daris.

2567
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
It's a long name to log in on.

2568
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Did you say we can temper uniques?

2569
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Are you open to letting us

2570
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
imprint affixes?

2571
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
I had this thought

2572
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
we can imprint a unique

2573
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
but only once.

2574
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Yeah.

2575
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Going back,

2576
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
that was kind of what I talked about

2577
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
with the unique section.

2578
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
We right now know,

2579
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I'm not going to say

2580
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
never in the future,

2581
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
it's definitely the obvious thing

2582
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,000
that we could do,

2583
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
like, you know,

2584
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,000
just add temporary uniques,

2585
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,000
of course.

2586
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
But we want them

2587
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,000
to have an identity

2588
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
that is very different

2589
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
from legendaries.

2590
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
One of the concerns with that

2591
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:25,000
is that the more

2592
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
that you give uniques manipulation,

2593
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,000
the more that they just

2594
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
turn into legendaries

2595
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
with a different item color

2596
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
when they drop on the ground.

2597
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Right?

2598
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Like, they're actually not

2599
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
different in how they work.

2600
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
If we were able to manipulate stats,

2601
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,000
add stats,

2602
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
all those things.

2603
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
So we do want them

2604
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
to have a different identity

2605
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
in the game.

2606
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
So we're not doing it now.

2607
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,000
But, you know,

2608
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,000
in the future,

2609
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
we've talked about it.

2610
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
We're open to the idea.

2611
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
But we do want to try

2612
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
this first of, like,

2613
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
double downing on what makes

2614
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:49,000
a unique unique

2615
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
and that you build around it

2616
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:51,000
because there's a little bit

2617
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
of friction

2618
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
rather than just turning it

2619
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,000
into the item

2620
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
that you want every time.

2621
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Yep.

2622
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
A question from Baric is,

2623
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
hey, Adam,

2624
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
or Adams.

2625
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I have a question

2626
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
for the Q&A.

2627
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
How is the dev team

2628
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
feeling about the reception

2629
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
of Season 4?

2630
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Is that making them

2631
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
rethink any plans

2632
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
for future seasons?

2633
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I mean,

2634
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I think one thing

2635
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
that we can most definitely

2636
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
call out here is, like,

2637
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
obviously Season 4

2638
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
has been really great.

2639
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Like, we've been hearing

2640
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
a lot of great feedback

2641
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,000
from players.

2642
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
and, you know,

2643
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
we're very well aware

2644
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
of, like, you know,

2645
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
how everyone's been enjoying it.

2646
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I think one huge thing

2647
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
that's helped with that

2648
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
as well was, like,

2649
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
the idea that we had

2650
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
a PTR for Season 4.

2651
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
And now we're seeing that

2652
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
again for Season 5.

2653
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So, like, we know,

2654
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
like, having that moment

2655
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,000
where players can actually

2656
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
jump in, provide feedback,

2657
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
give us some notes

2658
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
on specific things

2659
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
is really beneficial,

2660
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
especially when we have, like,

2661
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
new huge features

2662
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
like what we did

2663
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
for Season 4,

2664
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
which was, you know,

2665
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
obviously tempering,

2666
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
masterworking,

2667
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
the pit,

2668
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
all new Helltides,

2669
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
there was a ton

2670
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:47,000
of new features.

2671
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And then, of course,

2672
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
with Season 5, you know,

2673
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
players are now going

2674
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
to be able to run

2675
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
through Infernal Horde,

2676
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
tons of new gear

2677
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
and legendary aspects

2678
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
for them.

2679
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,000
So it's just, like,

2680
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
a ton of stuff

2681
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
that we know

2682
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
that we can most definitely

2683
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
take feedback on

2684
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
and having those moments

2685
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
has really helped us

2686
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
with some of those decisions.

2687
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Yeah, I would say

2688
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
on the design team side,

2689
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I know, like,

2690
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
the people on the team

2691
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:08,000
are very happy

2692
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
with how Season 4 went.

2693
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
It couldn't have gotten

2694
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
better, really, in our eyes.

2695
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
PTR was a huge deal,

2696
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
helped us a lot,

2697
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
especially on the balance

2698
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
and design side,

2699
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:16,000
to, you know,

2700
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
get things into a better place.

2701
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Another thing I may call out

2702
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
with Season 4 is that,

2703
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I don't know how to phrase it,

2704
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:25,000
like,

2705
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
you know,

2706
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
there's been a lot of disruption

2707
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
to the game, right?

2708
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
And so,

2709
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
when there's that much disruption

2710
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:34,000
of, like, you know,

2711
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
we update all the core math

2712
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
and all the items

2713
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,000
and everything,

2714
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,000
you know,

2715
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
it's very difficult

2716
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,000
to get things

2717
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
into a fine-tuned state,

2718
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,000
right?

2719
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,000
And, you know,

2720
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
without giving anything away,

2721
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
we have big updates

2722
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
coming in the future

2723
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:44,000
with, you know,

2724
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
expansion and other things.

2725
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,000
But one of the things

2726
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
that we're looking forward

2727
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
to, I think,

2728
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,000
as a team

2729
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
is when we've kind of

2730
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
settled down a little bit

2731
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
on the big disruptions,

2732
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,000
like, overall,

2733
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,000
you know,

2734
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
all of itemization

2735
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
and things like that,

2736
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
because, you know,

2737
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
it becomes a lot more difficult

2738
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
to fine-tune things

2739
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,000
like balance

2740
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
or even on the design side,

2741
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,000
like, designs

2742
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
and making sure

2743
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:03,000
that they work

2744
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
and that we're, like,

2745
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
iterating

2746
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
and upgrading things

2747
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
versus, you know,

2748
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
changing things around

2749
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
in huge ways.

2750
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
So while we think

2751
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
it was really successful

2752
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
and we're happy

2753
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
with how itemization 2.0

2754
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,000
turned out,

2755
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
the team is looking forward

2756
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:17,000
to, like,

2757
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
making the things

2758
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
as they are

2759
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
and make them work better

2760
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
and more do fine-tuning work.

2761
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
And so I think

2762
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
you can expect

2763
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
in the future as a player,

2764
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
you know,

2765
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
after we've done

2766
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
some more disruption

2767
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:28,000
and made the game,

2768
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
like, in a really good place,

2769
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
we're very happy with it,

2770
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
which we're really close to now,

2771
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I think,

2772
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
that, you know,

2773
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
you have tighter class balance,

2774
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
tighter designs,

2775
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
tighter roles for things,

2776
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
and just,

2777
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,000
you know,

2778
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
one of the things

2779
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
that excites me

2780
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:41,000
and excited the team

2781
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
about Season 4

2782
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,000
was, like,

2783
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
the tons of quality

2784
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,000
of life improvements

2785
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
and how much of an impact

2786
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
that makes on players,

2787
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
which I think we knew,

2788
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
but it hit home

2789
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:49,000
in Season 4, right?

2790
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Like, just the Codex of Power,

2791
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
how that changed

2792
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
and how that completely

2793
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
fixed, you know,

2794
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
the hoarding of items

2795
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
and things like that,

2796
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I think,

2797
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
are what really jazz us a lot

2798
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,000
because it just makes

2799
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
that flow experience better,

2800
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:01,000
like the boss ladder,

2801
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:02,000
you know,

2802
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
being able to reset bosses,

2803
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
stuff like that,

2804
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I think,

2805
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
is actually really impactful

2806
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
and good for the longevity

2807
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,000
of the game.

2808
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
So we're excited

2809
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
to do more things like that.

2810
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
All right.

2811
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Last question

2812
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
that we have here

2813
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
is,

2814
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
it's just Satan's.

2815
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Satan's with a Z

2816
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
and 666 afterwards.

2817
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Very good theme.

2818
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Very Diablo.

2819
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Yeah, very Diablo theme.

2820
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
It's specifically asking,

2821
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
what is the seasonal theme?

2822
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Are we, like,

2823
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
holding back any information

2824
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
right now

2825
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
regarding that and stuff?

2826
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Dan, I don't know

2827
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
if you want to clarify here

2828
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
or if you want me to,

2829
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
you can.

2830
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
All right.

2831
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
So we haven't announced

2832
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
the name for the season yet,

2833
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
as far as I know,

2834
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
but the seasonal theme

2835
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
seems, I guess,

2836
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
fairly obvious.

2837
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
You know,

2838
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
we're going back to hell

2839
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
and so the theme

2840
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
is pretty much

2841
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
returning to hell.

2842
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
And while the Infernal Hordes

2843
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
is just one part of that,

2844
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
the rewards are another part.

2845
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
And when we have

2846
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
our season five live stream,

2847
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
we'll go into

2848
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
all of the rest of the things

2849
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
that we have planned

2850
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
for season five.

2851
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Exactly.

2852
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Yeah.

2853
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
We have some additional stuff

2854
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
to talk about

2855
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
when we do actually have

2856
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
our season five live stream.

2857
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:27,000
We're just,

2858
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
right now,

2859
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
the biggest focus

2860
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,000
for this stream

2861
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
is for people to hear

2862
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
about the content

2863
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
that they're going to be able

2864
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
to play in PTR

2865
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
and we want people

2866
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
to really hone in

2867
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
and focus in on that

2868
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
so we can actually

2869
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,000
get that feedback

2870
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
for the team here

2871
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
and we can make any changes

2872
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
that we may need to.

2873
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
So, but yeah,

2874
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
that is kind of

2875
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
going to wrap this up

2876
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
for today for Q&A.

2877
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I'm going to lightning round

2878
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
like a few quick things

2879
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
because I'm sure chat

2880
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
will kill me

2881
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:53,000
if I don't call it out.

2882
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Sure.

2883
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Now we're getting a lot

2884
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
of questions about loadouts.

2885
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
It is,

2886
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
again,

2887
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:57,000
still something

2888
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
that we are very well aware of

2889
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
and we still plan on.

2890
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
It just takes a lot of time.

2891
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
It's a huge,

2892
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
huge amount

2893
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
of overhaul changes

2894
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
and everything

2895
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,000
from that end.

2896
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Separately,

2897
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:09,000
we,

2898
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
this has been coming up a lot,

2899
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:13,000
auction house,

2900
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:14,000
there are currently

2901
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
no plans right now

2902
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
for something like that

2903
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
but we hear you guys.

2904
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:18,000
We,

2905
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
we,

2906
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:19,000
we,

2907
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
we feedback,

2908
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
things like that.

2909
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Let us know

2910
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
but right now

2911
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,000
those are,

2912
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
those are the two big things

2913
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
that I,

2914
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I've been seeing a ton in chat.

2915
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I just want to address them

2916
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
before people go like,

2917
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
you're not reading chat.

2918
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,000
You're,

2919
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
you're in some like

2920
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
alternate universe chat

2921
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
or something like that

2922
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
but PTR again,

2923
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:36,000
just to remind everyone,

2924
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
starts next Tuesday.

2925
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
It runs for one week.

2926
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
It's on PC Battle.net only.

2927
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Please provide feedback

2928
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:42,000
on our forums,

2929
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Reddit,

2930
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
social media,

2931
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
our community discord,

2932
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
things like that.

2933
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
We're always looking around.

2934
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
We really are,

2935
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
we really value the feedback

2936
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
that we get during

2937
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
these PTR processes

2938
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
and of course,

2939
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
at the same time,

2940
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,000
we,

2941
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
patch notes on the blog

2942
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
are live immediately

2943
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
after this stream

2944
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
so check out

2945
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
diablo4.com

2946
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
when those do get up.

2947
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Next time you guys see us,

2948
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
next time we stream

2949
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
is July 18th.

2950
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
It's the Spirit Born reveal.

2951
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Ooh.

2952
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Ooh.

2953
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
That's exciting.

2954
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Yeah,

2955
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
everyone gets to check out

2956
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,000
the,

2957
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
the,

2958
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
the Spirit Born.

2959
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:14,000
So,

2960
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
we'll be back live

2961
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:16,000
on stream

2962
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
on July 18th.

2963
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
We'll be revealing

2964
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
the brand new class

2965
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
coming to Diablo 4

2966
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
that will be part

2967
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:23,000
of Vessel of Hatred.

2968
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,000
So,

2969
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
we're really excited

2970
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
about that.

2971
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:26,000
And,

2972
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
yeah,

2973
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I think that wraps it up.

2974
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I want to give a huge

2975
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
shout out to Dan

2976
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
in Albany.

2977
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:31,000
