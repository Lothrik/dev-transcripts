00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

595
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

596
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

597
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You've been saying this whole time that Hell is Gumble.

598
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Now Hell is Here.

599
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Something that's always present in a Diablo title

600
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and we wanted to make sure that 50th Diablo IV

601
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
returning to Hell was a special moment.

602
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
We referenced the end game cinematic

603
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
with Prave and Enorious taking the fight

604
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
to Hell at the end of the game.

605
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
We really wanted to capture that experience.

606
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
that sensation of battling throngs of demons and hell.

607
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
In the Infernal Ports, they're going to go into this mode, battle waves of demons,

608
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and be able to kind of change the shape of the game experience as you play.

609
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Those of you who have joined a synth space game and throughout the seasons will have noticed

610
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
that we have this phenomenon in the world that's going on called Hell Tides.

611
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Some of you might have noticed that Hell Tides have been getting a lot worse lately,

612
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and now Hell is able to pierce the veil that's holding hell back from fully invading sanctuary

613
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and starting to take root in sanctuary.

614
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And we started by asking ourselves some questions.

615
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What is the state of sanctuary right before the vessel of hatred happens?

616
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
How has Hell changed now that Mephisto isn't there anymore?

617
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What are the demons up to?

618
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Where is Mephisto?

619
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Does he have anything to do with this?

620
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Or is this just hell rising of its own accord as the prophecy proclaimed?

621
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And so we thought to ourselves, how can we make things even worse for the people in sanctuary?

622
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
In this season, you'll very much get to dive into those mysteries with some unlikely allies

623
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and really get to the bottom of what's happening.

624
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So in this season, we play a lot with the notion of the enemy of my enemy as my friend.

625
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
How far would you go to save sanctuary, to save your world?

626
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What price would you pay?

627
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Would you sacrifice your soul for this?

628
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're going to meet a guy named Lockrin, who at first seems sort of usual,

629
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
but you're going to quickly realize that something is off, that something is a little strange with this guy.

630
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So Lockrin and Estelle are your allies, and they're going to help you return to hell.

631
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Both of them are experts and demons, and they're going to use that knowledge to help you return to hell

632
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and become more powerful to be able to battle the infernal hordes.

633
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The infernal hordes is a new endgame activity in Diablo IV.

634
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's primarily a wave-based activity. You're going to be fighting a wave after wave with demon

635
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
forces in hell. So if any of you have ever played wave-based gameplay before, you'll know that things

636
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
escalate. We've got meteor strikes and all sorts of things that try to keep you on your toes.

637
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
One thing the infernal hordes does differently is the notion of infernal offers.

638
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
In between each wave, you'll make a choice. You'll be granted an infernal offer,

639
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and by choosing one of three of these offers, you're going to change the game mode in some way,

640
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
a positive and a negative. You can imagine from the depths of hell these hands rise out,

641
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and offer you both a boon and a bane. A kiss and a curse.

642
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And this is a temptation that the Fell Council is making to you. And in this temptation,

643
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
you're offered more power, but that power comes at a cost. And so you get to choose, you know,

644
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
which temptations you're going to pursue during your infernal run, and then customize your

645
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
experience from there. One of the guiding principles of this game mode is replay. It's an in-game

646
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
mode that we want to make sure you're playing over and over again. So we really wanted to create

647
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
a broad set of enemies for you to fight during this mode. We've got many demons to choose from

648
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and the lexicon of Diablo's monster families, but we're also going to see some other foes you might

649
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
not expect. There are going to be certain types of enemies like goat men who have been banished to

650
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
hell that have now rallied to Mephisto and fight by his side. And even some unlucky souls that marched

651
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
on hell from the cathedral of light have now been revived and hell and fight against you alongside

652
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
the demons. Basically, everything that hell has to throw at you, we're throwing it at you this

653
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
season. The infernal hordes has been built with multiplayer in mind, but multiplayer is not required.

654
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
We want to make sure that solo players still have a very fun experience in the infernal hordes.

655
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Now that said, if you roll in with a party, you're going to have a lot of fun. This game mode is

656
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
going to appear in the eternal and in the seasonal realm, and that means that once the season is over,

657
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
it's here to stay. The infernal hordes is unlocked at World Tier 3, so really what you need to do

658
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
to access it is earn your way up to World Tier 3 and then complete an eternal questline that

659
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
takes you back to hell and then unlocks the infernal hordes. For World Tier 1 and 2 players,

660
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
we've built out a seasonal progression that will help them become more powerful in order to be

661
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
able to confront the infernal hordes. First is you can earn reputation, and that reputation

662
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
applies to a reputation track that earns lots of really cool rewards that'll make you more

663
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
powerful as you progress onto World Tier 3. The other thing we've built are micro dungeons called

664
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Hell breaches that offer a glimpse at the infernal hordes mechanics, and they give you a chance to

665
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
learn the mechanics before you confront the infernal hordes at World Tier 3. The final boss in

666
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
this season is the fel council. And the fel council is some familiar faces that you might recognize from

667
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Diablo 2. These were priests of the Zachary Room, holy men who were corrupted and basically became

668
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
vessels of hatred in their own right. The council members in Diablo 2 tried to help contain

669
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Mephisto in his soul stone, and of course Mephisto being Mephisto slowly but surely corrupted them,

670
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and eventually they had soul stones pierced into their hands and became super powerful. But eventually

671
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
you overcame them and sent them to hell. Through the course of the story resummoned them,

672
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
they've been reborn, slightly new powers, but the same animosity toward you. What's interesting

673
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
about this boss encounter is there five council members, but you're only going to fight three of them at once.

674
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
This allows us to then create many different flavors of the boss fight for the fel council. In fact,

675
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
it's about 10 variations at all. And so every time you go into that council fight, there's a very good

676
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
chance you're going to have a different fight than the last time you played. We think it's going to

677
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
offer a lot of replay for players. What we also introduced during these waves are opportunities for

678
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
you to earn ether. Earning ether is the resource that you gather during the infernal hordes,

679
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that you can then spend at the end of the activity. There's going to be a fixed number of waves

680
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
you have to defeat, and once you've completed all those waves, then you'll face the fel council to

681
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,000
feed them and collect your treasure. So upon defeating the fel council, the spoils of hell will spawn,

682
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and then you consume your burning ether and opening those chests. Now, the trick is when you are

683
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
playing through these waves, that's your opportunity to earn as much ether as you can. Different events

684
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
are going to spawn all throughout the waves around the periphery of the arena, and it's your job to

685
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
try and defeat as many of those events as possible to try and gather up all the ether you can't.

686
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Really skilled players are going to be able to really maximize that ether so they get the biggest

687
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
payout possible at the end after defeating the fel council. So with this burning ether, you'll be

688
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
able to get new uniques, you'll be able to get new legendaries, you'll be able to get rare materials,

689
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
things you might have scoured the whole sanctuary for in previous seasons are in the base game,

690
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
but now we offer it to you here down in the depths of hell. A lot of these new uniques and legendaries

691
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
really build on top of this idea that they've been forged in hell, and so they're going to have

692
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
unique looks that you can then make into cosmetics to apply wherever you like. They can also have

693
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
unique VFX and sound effects to really create the sense that they were forged in hell. One particular

694
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
one that I enjoy using a lot are boots. Boots, you say. Well, these boots not only have been forged

695
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
in hell, whenever you use a power with a cooldown, they shoot out a ring of fire that hits everyone

696
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
around you. That's just one sample of the types of powers we're exploring.

697
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So death in the infernal hordes is quite a big deal. You're returning to the realm of hatred,

698
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
where Mephisto is born, like this has to be a big deal. In the infernal hordes, it's a lot like

699
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
nightmare dungeons. You only get a fixed number of revives in order to be able to get to the end of

700
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
your run. So at lower difficulties in the infernal hordes, you'll get a number of revives shared

701
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
between your party. But at higher difficulty levels, the game is going to start taking away those

702
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
revives and that increases the stakes that you have. You die too much, you'll be ejected from the

703
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
load. In the infernal hordes, we created a lot of new ways for monsters to ambush the players,

704
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and so I'm pretty stoked to see how our players respond to these. The seasonal quest line and

705
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
the eternal quest line, they have lots of little surprises and twists and turns in them,

706
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and there's even some surprises we've buried deep within the infernal hordes that hopefully players

707
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
will have a great time.

708
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Hello everyone and welcome to our season of the infernal hordes developer update stream.

709
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
My name is Marcus Krets, I'm a community manager here on the Diablo team,

710
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and today I'm joined by some very familiar faces, Adam and Adam, welcome to the stream.

711
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, we did it. We did it over. We did it over.

712
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We did it over. It's just Adam and he's the Adam and Adam show.

713
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Now I don't even have the host.

714
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah, I don't feel like it feels great.

715
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Yeah, and for everyone, curious and chat, Adam is not going anywhere.

716
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
As you all know, there's a ton going on in Diablo. Yeah, Adam Fletcher is going.

717
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
This one, the Adam Jacks. I have the Adam Hunter.

718
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
There's a ton going on in Diablo right now. We've had a ton of live streams. There's been

719
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
so much going on, so it's just a lot easier to share the load amongst all the other.

720
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yeah, we just finished this very born live stream, so it's a little crazy.

721
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Marcus is here to help out. You guys may see Marcus more here,

722
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
hosting some live streams in the future, but yeah, I'm not disappearing.

723
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah, Adam is pulling today.

724
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Yeah, exactly.

725
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah, today I get to pretend I'm calling.

726
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
That's a pretty excited about that.

727
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Some big, big shoes to fill there.

728
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah, that is absolutely true.

729
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
In terms of everything that's been going on in Diablo, we just had our season in the Infernal

730
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Horde's PTR, and we got a lot of learnings.

731
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, we, but we also do have one additional person.

732
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Of course we do.

733
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Mr. Dan Dangway from Albany, New York.

734
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Dan, look at the stream.

735
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Hey, how's everyone doing?

736
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Doing great.

737
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Good to see you.

738
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
See, Dan's in like the Cathedral of Light, or in the Burning House.

739
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah, yeah, it's perfect.

740
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's hot over here, exactly.

741
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It tracks.

742
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah.

743
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Thanks for joining us today, Dan.

744
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And the season five PTR.

745
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We've got a lot of learnings.

746
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
This was our second PTR for Diablo IV.

747
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So we have a ton of feedback to get into, but we also have some notes from the community

748
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
on the PTR overall and some learning.

749
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So Adam, do you want to walk us through that?

750
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah, most definitely.

751
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You know, this is now our second PTR that we had.

752
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We had one for season four, and of course one now for season five.

753
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And we've learned a lot from these PTR.

754
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
PTR is an incredibly important,

755
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
they're huge, they're really beneficial for the whole entire team here.

756
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And one thing we heard a lot of feedback, at least from the season five PTR,

757
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
is obviously, as you're playing through a PTR,

758
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
it's a non-final thing that you're playing.

759
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's still very early on.

760
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
There are going to be more bugs, more issues,

761
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
just present in the PTR because we are getting something out there a little bit earlier,

762
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
just so we can get feedback in on it.

763
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But one thing that I think we most definitely heard from the community is,

764
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
hey, the tools within PTR at times haven't been the best for the most efficient

765
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
for players that need to actually test the content that we actually do have.

766
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And so one thing that we did want to at least address and highlight and acknowledge is that,

767
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you know, we do plan on making the PTR experiences better in the future.

768
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We do plan on equipping more tools for players out there.

769
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So they're not having to sit there and grind out, you know,

770
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
maybe like all the new legendaries are unique or something.

771
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Especially in like season five, for example, we gave a character copy of the future in this one.

772
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And then of course, we had the boost feature which came back from season four.

773
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And when you boosted your character, a new character,

774
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
you would end up getting some of the new legendaries or unique within season five.

775
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
What happened though is that it wasn't all of them.

776
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And then we had players within season five having to actually go out and spend their time that

777
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
they probably could be testing other things, like trying to find those items.

778
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And obviously that's like not the most efficient thing to do.

779
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So we do want to, we hear everyone, we acknowledge it.

780
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We do want to make the PTR experience better.

781
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So I will say that like in future PTRs and you'll see this gradually over over the next couple of PTRs,

782
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
it won't be all of a sudden, like things will be completely different.

783
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But I do expect like and players should expect like that we will have better tools for them

784
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
to properly test as we gradually go through PTRs in the future.

785
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And we appreciate everyone like letting us know.

786
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And we must definitely hear you guys.

787
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And we most definitely want to make that experience better from that.

788
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But PTR has been great.

789
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Huge thanks to everyone for jumping in and checking it out for sure.

790
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Yeah, definitely.

791
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, that feedback is so important.

792
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So, you know, increasing how great these PTRs are is really, really important.

793
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And I know for the season five PTR, one of the huge features that we had in there was the

794
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Infernal Hords itself.

795
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So for everyone who didn't get a chance to jump into the PTR, Mr. Dan Tangue,

796
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
can you kind of walk us through what the Infernal Hords is and what players can expect?

797
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Yeah, absolutely.

798
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'll give you all a quick recap.

799
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
So the Infernal Hords is a wave-based activity with

800
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
your luck choices in between each of those waves.

801
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So, imagine waves of monsters coming in, lots and lots of monsters.

802
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
In fact, and you also have some events, many events that you can also participate in.

803
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Now, in between those waves, you're going to be making what's called the Infernal offer.

804
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And you're going to pick a Boon or a Bane, and that's going to change your gameplay

805
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
for the rest of the run.

806
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So it allows you to customize what your Infernal run is going to be like.

807
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And so we probably see right here, yep, we've got an Infernal offer that comes up.

808
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So you're going to select one of those, and that will then change, of course, the rest of the run.

809
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Now, when you complete the required number of waves, then you're able to go

810
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
confront the Fell Council, who you can see here.

811
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And the Fell Council, as you saw from the video that just came on right before this live stream,

812
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
are former servants, well, actually current servants of Mifisto, that you defeated in Diablo 2,

813
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and have now returned, and you must fight them once more.

814
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And once you beat them, you're going to be able to spawn what's called the spoils of hell.

815
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And these are chests that contain a lot of great goodies.

816
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And so with that burning aether, you've been collecting all through the course of the mode.

817
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You're able to choose what kind of spoils you want.

818
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You've got a spoils of legendaries and yeaks.

819
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And there's some absolutely great new yeaks and legendaries in season five.

820
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And you can probably farm about half of them, over half of them from the Infernal Orts.

821
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You're also able to spawn spoils of materials and buy into that.

822
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And that will get you gem shards that will get you angels breath.

823
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And of course, that'll get you master working materials, which you absolutely need to complete your items journey.

824
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You can also cash out and get a bunch of gold, which for those folks who are re-rolling their items

825
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
in order to master work them, or to enchant their items, is going to be hugely beneficial.

826
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And then finally, there's a special bonus chest at higher tiers, where you can get a guaranteed roll

827
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,000
on a greater affix item. And so since that's one of the main chases in the, you know, the final steps

828
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
of the end game, you know, we wanted to make sure there was an opportunity for players to really,

829
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
you know, get a little more lucky with it.

830
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So final thoughts on the Infernal Orts.

831
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Remember that at Unlocks at World Tier 3, you need an Infernal Compass in order to unlock it.

832
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And there's eight levels of difficulty for it.

833
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And so yeah, that's a quick recap.

834
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Awesome. Thanks for walking us through Dan.

835
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Super excited to jump in and try to grab some of those uniques.

836
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Now I know considering the Infernal Orts was such a big part of PTR,

837
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
we did have a lot of community feedback with regards to, you know, getting into the mode,

838
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
you know, some of the pacing. So can you walk us through some of those learnings we had

839
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
based off the PTR feedback?

840
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Oh, absolutely. So there was a lot of feedback that came in and so much so that we weren't able to

841
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,000
address it all. But we did distill down some big trends and feedback that we were able to tackle.

842
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And so the first off is that we wanted to improve access to the Infernal Orts.

843
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So yeah, it was just too hard to get into the mode regularly to test it.

844
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And folks wanted to get into it very quickly. Couldn't get into it either.

845
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So we pretty much overhauled access to the Infernal Orts at this point.

846
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Compuses still exist, but the drop rates on those have been boosted quite a bit.

847
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
We want you to earn around four or five compasses an hour so that you can do about four or five

848
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,000
hours runs per hour. So you've got, you know, 50% chance to get them from item chest and

849
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
health hides. Unless it's one of those item chests that costs, you know, 250 senders in which case,

850
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
that's 100% chance. I mean, you put in the time. We'll just give it to you.

851
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And then, you know, nightmare dungeon and whispers, there's about a 75% chance to getting,

852
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
get one from a dungeon complete there. You know, compass tiers at really high levels.

853
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We wanted to make sure drop naturally from high tiered activities like nightmare dungeons and the pet.

854
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And we've also given you a path to just crafting these outright with the occultus,

855
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
with sigilpower and forgotten souls. And then finally, you know, it was a bug that the first

856
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
compass that dropped from the eternal quest, it was actually a world tier three. And if you were playing

857
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
world tier four, sorry, world tier four, yeah, yeah, just switch back to actually get in the infernal

858
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
hordes and that didn't feel great. So we updated that as well. Moving along, the next big thing that

859
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,000
we focused on was combat. The pacing of combat wasn't hitting our goals. And, you know, we had

860
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
done a lot of internal testing on it. And, you know, folks who weren't as in game focused gave us a

861
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
lot of feedback where, you know, oh, this is super intense. Could we dial it back a little bit?

862
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So we did. But then we put it out on PTR and clearly all said, hey, no, we want more. So we're

863
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
giving you more. The first thing that we did though is we fixed some bugs that actually had a

864
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
really big impact on the experience. There was a boss, a boss health bug. Man, that is hard to say,

865
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
boss health bug that caused all the bosses to be super tanky. And at tier eight, there were some

866
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
folks who were spending almost an hours worth of time in the infernal's hord. And that just,

867
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
that's not what we wanted. So we fixed those bugs and retuned everything. So, you know, it's a much

868
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
tighter experience at this point. Similarly, there was a bug where difficulty wasn't scaling

869
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
appropriate in multiplayer. So we fixed that. And then some tuning things. So the pace of many events

870
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
are pretty much rapid fire at high tiers now, you know. And so you're going to be spending a lot

871
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
of plates in this mode. The monster spawn rates have also been increased to, you know, really capture

872
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
that feeling of being overwhelmed. And then finally, we reduced the wave timer down to 60 seconds,

873
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,000
which, you know, just creates a much punchier experience for players and of course, retuned everything.

874
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And then on top of that, we said, you know what? Let's just make it easier for players to pick up

875
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
burning a third and increase that pace. So the pets now pick up the burning aether as well.

876
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And that's not all. Now, of course, you know, we're all playing this for the rewards, right?

877
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And so it was really important for us to improve rewards across the board. You spend time with

878
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the mode you want to be rewarded appropriately and we weren't hitting that mark in the PTR.

879
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So we raised the minimum amount of burning aether earned from any single run. First off,

880
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
every single source of aether got boosted by one aether. And then we added aether drops to the

881
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
fel council so that you're also getting, you know, a lot of bang for your buck just by defeating the

882
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
boss as well. And that actually scales per tier as well. Next up, we retuned all the costs of

883
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the spoils of hell. So, you know, the greater equipment that one with the greater effects in it,

884
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
used to cost 250. Now it only costs 60. Similarly, we retuned the spoils of equipment and the

885
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
spoils of materials. So now they only cost 28 or a piece. And then finally, we retuned all the

886
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
rewards that were inside, you know, the the chest as well. So, you know, at your bare minimum level,

887
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
when you first start playing the infernal hordes and you're not sure exactly how it works,

888
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
we still want you to feel rewarded just for the time that you invest it. And so the rewards at

889
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
that bare minimum feel pretty good now. But, you know, if you are spending a lot of time with it,

890
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
you know how to optimize this mode. We wanted to make sure that, you know, the rewards reflected that

891
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
too. So that that higher, you know, ceiling of rewards has been raised as well. So you're playing

892
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
at tier eight, you are going to get significantly more rewards than you would at tier one.

893
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Awesome. Yeah, that's nice. Quite a bit. That's a lot of stuff that I just want to call it. Dan,

894
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
your shirt is amazing. I was thinking around, but I didn't want to. Now I dig into that shirt.

895
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And I'm very jealous that I don't actually own that shirt. So, yeah, I think after this stream,

896
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:09,000
yeah, I think someone on the team made it. So I was like, I needed a new shirt for the livestream.

897
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So that is her art 100%. Yeah, yeah. Now we know. And now I know. And it is totally awesome. I

898
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
had to wait. Yeah. I totally know. We will be touching base out of the stream. Yeah. Dan,

899
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
that's a ton of changes. It sounds like we're really cranking up the intensity for the infernal hordes.

900
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Really, really cool to see. Super excited to jump into it. So I know for the infernal hordes,

901
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
that's one part of the season that's coming. But there was a lot that players didn't get to

902
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
experience in the PTR that will be coming with the season. So can you kind of share what's going

903
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
to be new for players coming into season five? Yeah, absolutely. So the PTR was really focused on

904
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
features that were on both the eternal realm and the seasonal realm. And we have a number of

905
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
seasonal exclusive features that y'all haven't had a chance to play with yet. So we're going to

906
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
tell you about them now. First up, we've got the seasonal progression. So you're going to see

907
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
what we call the reputation system and some footage here in just a second. And the reputation

908
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
system is something that we had in season four and actually earlier in some events. And we've

909
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
brought it back here because it serves as a great backbone for the season. And we've evolved it

910
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
in some significant ways. So first off, how you earn reputation is a bit different now.

911
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It was really important for us in season five to give you more choice in how you wanted to earn

912
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
your reputation. So previously in season four, you earn reputation through just playing

913
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
health hides as you should because we made a lot of improvements to health hides in season four.

914
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But here we wanted to broaden it out a bit more. So you earn reputation in season five

915
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:55,000
by just defeating powerful servants of hell, elites, hellborne champions, bosses, so on and so forth.

916
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Right. And so that gives you a lot more choice to say, hey, you know, I can earn reputation in

917
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
health hides or I want to earn it in the infernal hordes. Or honestly, I want to take a break and do

918
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
a stronghold. You'll get reputation there too. Another small tweak that we made that's pretty

919
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
important is that when you pick up reputation, you actually get a small boost and XP as well.

920
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So as you're continually filling out your reputation track, you're starting to level up just a little

921
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
more quickly than you did before. Now, another thing that you might have seen are these big green

922
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,000
tiles in the reputation system. And those are seasonal quests. So we made it very clear that

923
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
hitting certain tiers of your reputation system now unlocked the seasonal quests. And it actually

924
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,000
starts to weave the narrative through the progression a bit more, which we really like the feel of

925
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and we hope to build on in the future. And then finally, you know, again, it's all about the rewards,

926
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
right. So there's lots of great returning rewards in the reputation system. You're going to be able to

927
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
earn, you know, unique specifically class-based uniques that are going to help you figure out what

928
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
you want your build to be early on in the season. You're also going to be able to get other powerful

929
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
equipment, big drops of crafting materials, and of course, at the very end of the reputation track

930
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
will be a resplendent spark that you can use to ultimately craft a mythic unique.

931
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Next up, we've got the seasonal quest line. You know, I was teasing it up a little bit with the

932
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
reputation system there. So the season of the Infernal Horde has a rather unique narrative flow

933
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,000
because we have an eternal quest line that introduces, you know, a big new feature that takes you

934
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
back to hell, right. And so we wanted to make sure that was available to everybody, not just

935
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
seasonal players. And that also starts at World Tier 3. Now, those of you who played the PTR have

936
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
already seen it. That's the one that features Locrine helping you to get back to hell and confront

937
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
the Infernal Horde. But we've developed an additional secondary, well, not really secondary, an

938
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
additional seasonal quest line named of lambs and wolves, which we're kind of teasing right here.

939
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And new NPC name Estelle is guiding you to become more powerful before you join Locrine to

940
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
journey back to hell. Now, this one's going to be a little closer and tone to the iron wolf's

941
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
quest in season 4, but it's going to be a bit more expansive than that. And like I said,

942
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
it weaves in and out of the seasonal progression. So how do they relate to one another? Well, the

943
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:48,000
seasonal quest line is exclusive to season 5. And so you are able to get a really more complete

944
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
picture of the story by playing both the seasonal quest line and the eternal quest line.

945
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You can kind of think of the seasonal quest line as almost like a prequel to you unlocking the

946
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Infernal Horde. And, but we also wanted to make sure that our Eternal players don't get left out.

947
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
This is an Eternal Mode that we're introducing after all with the Infernal Horde. And so, you know,

948
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,000
the Infernal or rather the Eternal Quest line here, which is named Eyes of the Enemy, is going to

949
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
be available for all players and won't go away after the season ends. So it's going to be there

950
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
forever. So if you decide sometime down the road that you want to check out the Infernal Hordes

951
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and say, I don't know, season 6, you can do that, right? And so, yeah, that's where we ended up with

952
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
the quest lines, the season. And then the final thing I want to introduce are the Hellbreach Dungeons,

953
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
which I've gotten a few teases of before, but we can go into more detail here. So these are all

954
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:55,000
new micro dungeons to show that Hell is started taking root in Sanctuary. Now, since the Infernal Hordes

955
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
is an end game activity, World Tier 3 Plus, we wanted to make sure we had some content that targeted

956
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
our World Tier 1 and 2 players. And so you go into these, it's going to be a great source of

957
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,000
reputation. It's going to be a great place to get some powerful items. And it's a pretty cool

958
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
place to just kind of experience what the gameplay is going to be like down the road. Now, originally,

959
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
we had kind of pattern these off the Donheim tunnels, if you all remember those. But with the

960
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
introduction of Hal Tide in season 4, we had to change it up a little bit because I don't think

961
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that alone would have sufficed. And so what we did is we pulled in a lot of elements from the

962
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Infernal Hordes. And we're using this as an opportunity to introduce those elements. So you see

963
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
right here, we've got a simple Infernal choice that shows that basically says, okay, do I want my

964
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
boss to be a little simpler or a little more difficult? And you get to choose. Hopefully the person

965
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,000
playing chose the more difficult one I didn't see. But you're going to be rewarded a lot more

966
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
for taking that risk of making the boss more difficult. And you're going to be earning burning

967
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
ather in it. The end, there are going to be some spoils that you can spend on. And like I said,

Infernal Hordes. So if you want more details on these, I recommend that you check out our blog that

970

came out two days ago. And yeah, thank you. Dan, that's awesome. I got to say, Chat got pretty

971
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
excited when you mentioned Domain Tunnels. They kind of blew up there. Definitely, definitely

972
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,000
a fantasy of everyone remembers the Dopa mean tunnels. Yeah, right. And it's great that there's now

973
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
like opportunities for players within like, Walter one and two to actually be able to have other

974
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
options involving up and with these new help reaches it's good way for people to tease in.

975
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Exactly. Yeah. Then you get into those Infernal Hordes in

976
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Walter three enough away you go. Yeah, that's awesome. Dan, thanks so much for joining us.

977
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
As Dan had mentioned, we did publish the season the Infernal Hordes blog a little bit earlier this

978
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
week. We are going to have patch notes that will publish following the stream. So for any details

979
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
we reveal across the stream, you can check those out for more information. Dan's going to join us

980
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
towards the end of the stream for our Q&A. So if you have any questions, please drop those in Twitch

981
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
chat and we'll be pulling them to get into those towards the end of the stream. So we just touched

982
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
on a ton of stuff that's coming in season the Infernal Hordes itself. But based off the PTR,

983
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
we also have a ton of changes coming across sanctuary. Yes. And to walk us through from the other

984
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
end of the stream, Mr. Adam Funcher. Yeah, I get to pretend like I'm the person on the panel.

985
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I'm going to you just like to do all this. Yeah. Exactly. Put in all the changes. We have a fantastic

986
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:51,000
design team here and I am going to bring in my inner column finer to talk about some stuff.

987
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
But yes, as Mark has mentioned, there's a lot of changes. A lot of the stuff that we actually did

988
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
talk about in the blog and some of the stuff that people heard from PTR. But there have been changes

989
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
even since PTR. And we have a few new things in here that we'll also squeak in here as we're

990
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
talking about it. But one big topic I know that everyone brought up after PTR and that we even

991
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
brought up even during our PTR stream was held tied specifically. One big topic within a held

992
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
ties was Bainful Hearts. If you guys remember back during the PTR stream, we talked about how

993
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
season four everyone had a plethora of Bainful Hearts. I mean, it felt like everyone was always

994
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
carrying about 100 to 150 at any given time. And you can deposit as many into your hearts desire

995
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and still always have that same amount. We want painful hearts to feel a little bit more special.

996
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And so during the PTR, we actually did take the number down in terms of how many you would be

997
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
able to earn. We did hear everyone's feedback. People were like, that feels kind of crappy.

998
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
We most definitely readjusted the drop rate of Bainful Hearts to really kind of close that gap

999
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
in between season four and season five PTR. We wanted to make sure that was, you know,

1000
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
it feels better. Like you won't have 150 on you at all times most likely, but you still have

1001
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
plenty now to be able to summon the maiden as well. So some of the changes that we have coming up

1002
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
for Bainful Hearts and the rate that will help with this is that we're bumping up the drop rates

1003
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
off of chess within held ties specifically. Players will also be able to get a guaranteed

1004
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
hard drop off of Hell-Tie commanders now. And then one big thing is within World Bosses,

1005
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
yeah, we actually have an image of where you'll be able to now get your hard drop rates guaranteed

1006
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
is World Bosses. Sometimes World Bosses actually do spawn within a held tied zone. And we thought

1007
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
it would be kind of cool that, you know, a killed the World Boss there and a held tied happened

1008
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
to be present in that specific zone where the World Bosses. Now you'll just get a guaranteed

1009
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
three within that World Boss cut, which is kind of nice. That's super cool. We're also bumping up

1010
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
the drop chance to like local events, mastery chess within held tied, and of course, Harbingers

1011
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
within it as well. And then one big change that we're doing within this as well is the Blood Maiden

1012
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
within World Tier 1 and 2 in season 4 and even season 5 PTR, you would have to deposit three hearts

1013
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
just like World Tier 3 and World Tier 4. We're actually tweaking that down to just two. So

1014
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:25,000
for World Tier 1 and 2. So there'll be one less like Ultra Pedestool for you to deposit a heart for

1015
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
for to some of the Blood Maiden within World Tier 1 and 2, which should help out with, you know.

1016
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Just makes your farming a little bit quicker in the early levels. Exactly. Exactly. And it doesn't

1017
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
feel like you're needing to put in that many for those earlier levels. That's much easier to change

1018
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
in ton of blood mains back to back to back. Exactly. Yeah. So next thing we did want to talk about is

1019
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,000
within held ties as Tortured Gifts, another change for World Tier 1 and 2, there'll be less

1020
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,000
senders required to open up the Tortured Gift Chess within World Tier 1 and 2. So it's dropping

1021
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
from 100 to 75 specifically. And then this is something we talked about in the last ring where it

1022
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
was like really difficult for players to actually kind of go through a held tied and complete,

1023
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
you know, a full on like, you know, trio whispers like progression line within held tied.

1024
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So now you'll actually be able to earn all 10 grim favors within a held tied for sure

1025
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
when it's in one subzone. And actually deposit that within the trio whispers and get the

1026
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
root that the whisper cash out of it. I know sometimes it would take like people, sometimes two

1027
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
held ties actually do it. Or you would have to leave the held tied and go to a non held tied

1028
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
zone kind of finish it off and stuff. And so we wanted to make sure that was more efficient

1029
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,000
specifically within held ties. And then this was a big thing. Big one. So you know, we talked about

1030
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
during the season five PTR stream that we were that profane mind cages were a season form

1031
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:58,000
mechanic. It was it was only were not. Yeah. And so it was it was removed from from season five,

1032
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
heard the feedback. And people were like, wow, we really missed mind cages, bring them back,

1033
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,000
what's going on. So we did bring them back and we brought them back in like a cooler form. So

1034
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
now you can actually stack up. So one profane mind cages are coming back for season five.

1035
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
You can actually stack these now up to three X in season five. This is season only. So this

1036
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:25,000
is only on the the seasonal realm specifically. But now stacking up to three X does actually boost up

1037
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:33,000
monster rules. Yeah. So you'll end up you could knock monster levels up, you know,

1038
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:43,000
30 levels if you wanted to. And you will benefit or maybe suffer. But it does give players

1039
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the option now to use that. And so profane mind cages are back and in a kind of a cooler form

1040
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
for season five. And we really appreciate the feedback we heard from players regarding held

1041
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,000
ties on that. Next overall just general game updates that we do have. One big thing that we're

1042
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
doing is we are boosting legendary drop rates off of really pretty much almost like all

1043
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
most content like held ties and your dungeons and frontal hordes for any monster that is level

1044
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
100 or higher. So you'll be able to see and just obtain more legendaries that way. Less rare

1045
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
things like that. Separately enchanting one big thing we heard is, you know, people were some

1046
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:30,000
you know blocked a little bit with angels breath. And so we did remove angels breath as a cost

1047
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,000
towards enchanting. It's no longer required. We've actually now kind of just swapped this over to

1048
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
the respective legendary salvage. So for instance, armor would be coiling awards weapons,

1049
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
balehole fragments and then jewelry, upstruced sigils sigils that tongue twister there.

1050
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Upstruced sigils. Upstruced sigils. But you now have the ability of being able to do enchanting.

1051
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Just note that of course, gold costs are still associated with enchanting. But now it's a little bit

1052
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
removing a little bit of that friction with the angels breath requirement. And then this is

1053
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
something that we had talked about beforehand, which is just crowd control overall within season 5

1054
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
is me a lot better. I know crowd control can be sometimes painful or you know knock down.

1055
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yeah, here knock down and frozen for a million years. It's cruel and then dying horribly.

1056
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And so CC duration has been essentially just pretty much reduced like across the board to like

1057
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,000
1.5 seconds max. And then one cool feature is you can also spam potions now while you're CC'd.

1058
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Really good for like like you know people on hardcore or like maybe it's like it creates more

1059
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,000
desperate moments of like I'm still dying. But you now have the ability of being able to spam

1060
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
potions specifically if you are CC'd which is really nice. Yeah, we were talking about like

1061
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
and charging like bloated course fans when they like to stun you and they do the poison aoe

1062
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
as a as a keyboard slammer myself. Thank you. Yes, exactly.

1063
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Next update we have is world bosses. So, uh,

1064
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
finding enough, uh, this actually fell into season 5 ptr but that we forgot to actually put it

1065
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
in season 5 ptr notes nor are no and we actually forgot to actually mention it. We got a lot

1066
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
of reports of people going like, Hey, why are world bosses like tankier harder than hell?

1067
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
To fight back down. Yeah, we had a lot of post-toilets.

1068
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Uh, so they actually had a feature called resilience on there. Essentially resilience,

1069
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
uh, normalizes damage across like all world content. So it's like if you share world content.

1070
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So like if a bunch of people are all coming into a world boss you're, you should expect to find

1071
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
that the world bosses will be a little bit more tankier, a little bit longer in terms of the

1072
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
experience that you're having as you're, you're fighting against them. Yeah. Um, uh, and less,

1073
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,000
you know, like, Hey, I blinked and it's gone. Yeah. Oh, sweet. The boss was here for three seconds.

1074
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Nice. Yeah, exactly. So, they barely even spawn in. No, no, no, it was actually present in ptr and

1075
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
we actually got a lot of people that were going like, Hey, I think this is a bug and it actually

1076
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
wasn't a bug. It was just a feature for you. We forgot to actually mention, uh, in the, in the

1077
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
patch and so that is our bad, but we do want to make sure that everyone's aware that we have

1078
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
bosses now have a feature called resilience and that will end up helping out with those encounters

1079
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:17,000
specifically separately for bosses. Um, Pit Boss damage has been reduced pretty much across the

1080
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
board. Um, and then one big thing that we did want to call out is, uh, we, we got a lot of feedback

1081
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
within, you know, um, season four and, and of course the ptr for season five, uh, we, we, we,

1082
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,000
well, we saw some people, uh, address the changes that we were having there. Um, but Pit Boss has had,

1083
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
uh, this tendency within season four to have like very sharp damage, yeah, uh, where it would

1084
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
scale up really hard and there were times where you would run into a specific boss and you, um,

1085
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,000
could potentially just get one shot based off of like those, the, their, the shadow boss like,

1086
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
like, yeah, the extra one. They left in

1087
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
you died. Yeah. So now, uh, there is a feature within season five where those shadow pit boss

1088
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,000
like affixes will appear and they'll actually leave kind of a stacking debuff onto, uh, players,

1089
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
now. So, uh, and it can go up to three times and then obviously when it gets to the max, you

1090
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:22,000
have a very good chance of getting like heavily, like, like, punish for, for taking up to three

1091
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:29,000
debuffs from that end. This is really to, um, allow a little bit more flexibility for players,

1092
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
you know, based off of the feedback we heard regarding a lot of the one shots and things like that.

1093
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Uh, you now have the ability of being able to, you know, take a couple of these debuffs and maybe

1094
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
not like completely get punished from that. It's less about like the perfection kind of involved,

1095
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
but more so, um, uh, being a little bit more forgiving in some of those, uh, opportunities. Now,

1096
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
if you are a person that just like, like, face tanks, things and goes in and immediately takes

1097
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
three debuffs, uh, you're probably still gonna, uh, you learn that, you know, that damage is still

1098
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
gonna be very sharp with the 3D. Yeah. So, um, but it is something to help out, uh, in regards to

1099
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
that. Yeah. To be clear how that debuff works is every time that you get hit with one of those

1100
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
shadow boss mechanics, you'll take the debuff and it increases all of your damage takings. So,

1101
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
the regular boss is gonna hit you harder and the shadow bosses are gonna hit you harder too. Exactly.

1102
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So, you know, you just don't want that to ramp up too much because then everything is gonna be

1103
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
more punishy. Yeah. Exactly. There's a few people already asking about those, uh, debuffs and

1104
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,000
chats. Yeah. It just increases all your damage takings. So, basically, you know, you get some freebies

1105
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
of getting hit by them. You really don't want to, but then after that you gotta watch out because

1106
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
the next about is hardest season four was. Exactly. So, um, and then another big thing. So, this was

1107
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
something that was actually not present in the PTR, but it's something that we've heard a lot of

1108
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,000
feedback about and, uh, actually a ton of feedback about, uh, and this is group play in, uh, in pits,

1109
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:56,000
in season four, the way that it worked was, uh, if you were in the pit and you were the party leader,

1110
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
uh, and you had three friends that joined along, you would essentially get through the pit,

1111
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,000
you would get all the master working materials, uh, for yourself, 100% of them, and then everyone

1112
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
else, uh, uh, that joined you would only get about like 50%. And, uh, it felt pretty punishing, uh,

1113
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
for, for people to really kind of join up with friends and run through pits. And we heard a lot

1114
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
of feedback of like, hey, it'd be great if like, if I'm just joining my friend, we can all just get,

1115
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
you know, uh, 100% of the pit material rewards. And so, that is being tweaked for season five.

1116
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Now, the whole entire party itself will end up receiving, uh, 100% of the, uh, the, the materials

1117
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
that you end up receiving at the end of the pit. Yeah. So, we appreciate the feedback. Thank you,

1118
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
guys, for, for letting us know, and this is something that wasn't in PTR, but will be for season five.

1119
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Uh, next up, we have endgame bosses. Um, so this is something, of course, we talked about during the

1120
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
PTR and we do want to highlight again because I think this is amazing and we'll save a whole lot of

1121
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,000
time. So, uh, you can now resummon endgame bosses, uh, immediately after you end up killing them. So,

1122
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
as you're going through the different boss ladders and stuff, you can, uh, just resum in the alterable

1123
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,000
reappears, you can see in the footage and, uh, throwing the, the, the mats and bam. Again, you're

1124
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
finding Garryl, which is really nice. No more exiting the dungeon, resetting the dungeon, running

1125
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
back and then, uh, having to do it over again. Uh, this should save up a whole lot of time.

1126
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
This should help a whole lot with farming as well, specifically for gear. You know,

1127
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
we'll be hearing a lot about all this new gear. Uh, different from, from Adam here in a second.

1128
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Um, but there were some additional changes as well to some of the endgame bosses that we do have,

1129
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
like for instance, the, what, first one we're going to talk about is the beast and ice. The beast

1130
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
and ice, of course, uh, had a required essential to actually summon, uh, you would have worked to

1131
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
actually create the dungeon to, to go in to fight, uh, the beast and ice. There's no longer a

1132
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
essential that will be required. Um, and also the beast and ice is now way closer to the dungeon.

1133
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
It's going to be a short dungeon crawl similar to the other endgame bosses. So you're not having to,

1134
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,000
you know, go through a, a lengthy, uh, just to get to the, um, yeah. Likewise, no more sigil dust will

1135
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
be required for summoning the beast and ice. And then of course, we thought about internal players

1136
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
in this situation because some of them have actually crafted a bunch of, uh, sigils and now,

1137
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:14,000
since sigils are no longer required, you can still use those leftover sigils to immediately resummon

1138
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
the beast and ice without needing the, uh, the mats that were, uh, that are still required for the

1139
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
beast and ice. So it's kind of a nice benefit to them. And then of course, Varshan also got some

1140
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
updates. Um, or Varshan required a bunch of different body parts. And now, uh, Varshan just

1141
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
requires malignant hearts. And of course, we thought about eternal players in this specific instance.

1142
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Eternal players can convert their old part, uh, their old body parts, uh, two hearts. Yeah. Uh,

1143
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
by going to the alchemist, that's a magical alchemist. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, if you have

1144
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
a need to spare a heart, you just go to an alchemist. That's just how it works. Yeah. That's just how it

1145
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
works. Um, but yeah, some changes coming to that. Uh, and then separately,

1146
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
endgame bosses, uh, for, for endgame bosses, the boss ladder, uh, bosses, um, they won't be dropping

1147
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
rare items anymore. They're actually just going to drop additional gold. And of course,

1148
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
you, you'll have your opportunity of getting legendaries and, uh, uniques and mythic uniques

1149
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,000
from, from them. So, uh, but now we just remove the rare item drop, uh, drops from them. So it,

1150
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
it takes up like less of the, uh, the drop chances that you could get in terms of, uh, their,

1151
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,000
their specific tables. And then on tormented bosses, tormented bosses now drop five time,

1152
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
as five times as many boss matches before. And of course, uh, all tormented bosses have a better

1153
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:35,000
chance of dropping a, uh, mythic unique. Um, so we are boosting up the, the mythic unique drop.

1154
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
There, there's actually specifics on all this stuff in the patch. And that's that people can

1155
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:45,000
read afterwards. And we've also reduced the, uh, the Stygian stone cost for, uh, the tormented

1156
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,000
bosses before it was two. And now it's dropping to one. So it should help out with players wanting to

1157
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
experiment, more, try out, uh, some of the more difficult, uh, endgame bosses that are available,

1158
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
which are their tormented versions. And then, uh, one big thing that is happening, and this is, uh,

1159
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
this is something that was kind of mentioned in the blog, but, uh, and people see more specifics in

1160
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
the patch notes, uh, experience is changing, um, uh, in terms of like the XP bonus from killing

1161
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:19,000
higher level monsters. Uh, it's no longer capped in, um, I believe it's now, well, it's, it's,

1162
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's 10 levels actually, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a capped, shall I say,

1163
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
it's a capped to 30 levels, that's actually incredible in this slide. But, um, it used to be 10 levels,

1164
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:35,000
it's now 30 levels, and that's across all world tiers. So, uh, if you happen, for example, if you

1165
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:44,000
are a level 50 character and you kill a level 80 monster in season four, you would only get, uh,

1166
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
level 60 experience. And now you'll get up to that level 80 experience. So, uh, it should help out a

1167
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
lot if you are willing to go through more challenging content, man, you get more XP for it. So,

1168
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,000
it's really cool. And it's also really nice that, uh, because it, it plays really well into, uh,

1169
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
stacking, profing mind cages, uh, uh, they have a whole burden in the appetite, because that can

1170
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:12,000
actually also increase monster level by 30 levels as well. So, it's kind of a, um, a cool, uh,

1171
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
anon you could say from this. So, yeah. Pretty sweet. Uh, yeah, I think that's it for general game

1172
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:26,000
updates. Yeah. But we, uh, yeah. Yeah. As I talked about a bunch, yeah. It's all in the patch notes.

1173
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,000
You guys will see the patch notes afterwards. Um, but, uh, yeah. Yeah. Really amazing. Have all those

1174
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
changes. Uh, chat was absolutely lighting up. Uh, cool. So, all the, you know, changes of the

1175
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
pit. And of course, even though we've shown the, the boss summoning reset again, they got just as

1176
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
excited. So, awesome to see. And I, you know, we really appreciate everyone's feedback during PTR.

1177
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And hearing, especially about the hell-tied stuff. And, you know, we totally hear you guys. And we

1178
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
want to make sure that, you know, people have to experience still, still enjoy hell-tied to the,

1179
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
the fullest. Yeah. Like, you know, what I mean? Exactly. No, it's really cool to talk so much.

1180
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Yeah. Those profane mind cages that are coming back. But yeah, Adam, thank you so much for that.

1181
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Yeah. Uh, and now everyone, uh, hope you're comfortable, uh, because we got a ton to go over with

1182
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:17,000
regards to, uh, updates, unique some bus fixes on a ton of class balance changes. Uh, who better to

1183
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
walk us through Mr. Adam Jackson. Yeah. Let's do it. So we got a lot to talk about today. I'll try and

1184
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
go as quickly as possible. Um, so yeah, firstly, you know, thank you all for your feedback and comments.

1185
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You know, we got a lot of class related feedback on the PTR, a lot of balance feedback, a lot of

1186
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,000
just how it feels to play things. Um, and we actually reacted pretty heavily and did a lot of

1187
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
changes between PTR and season five launch, uh, some of which I think some people know and some

1188
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
things are going to be new for you today. So, uh, really, yeah, we have a lot of things that,

1189
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
that changed, uh, in many ways, honestly, it's going to feel like almost from a balanced perspective

1190
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and kind of a what your class can do in your journey. It's going to feel almost like a very

1191
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
different game compared to what you experienced on the PTR. I'm going to go through a lot of like

1192
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
the systemic reasons why and then some specific things that we did to every class, as well as,

1193
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
of course, updating all of our uniques and kind of the impact that you can expect from that.

1194
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,000
So, uh, lost to talk about. So, first we'll be talking about bug fixes. Um, we've got quite a few

1195
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
to go through that I think are pretty notable. Again, we're going to be doing the class balance

1196
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
updates after that and then the unique changes. So those will be the three things I'm going to be

1197
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
covering today. So, uh, firstly, as usual, you know, we're going to be publishing the patch notes

1198
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
right after this. So you can read all of them. I'm not going to cover everything today, but just some

1199
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
of the more notable ones. Uh, so first, uh, is one on the Necromancer that we've heard about for a

1200
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
while now. It's a shielding storm. Uh, this is a legendary that when your bone storm damages enemies,

1201
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,000
you get a barrier equal to your back's life. Uh, it used to be based on your base life instead of

1202
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,000
your max life. And now we finally fix that. Uh, to be clear, this is a pretty huge buff. Um,

1203
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
we may have to re-evaluate the power of this a little later, but we're going to see how it goes.

1204
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But now that barrier is going to be very significant as you're hitting enemies with this aspect.

1205
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Uh, next we've got a couple on the barbarian. Uh, the first one is the Twister glyph. This is a

1206
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Paragon node glyph. It wasn't properly giving you a bonus multiplicative damage when casting dust

1207
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
doubles. So dust double builds will be a little bit stronger. We also fix an issue with the temperate

1208
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
earthquake duration. Um, beforehand, uh, there was a bug where it was actually lowering the DPS of

1209
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
earthquake because it was increased the duration and then your DPS would go down. So we fixed that. So

1210
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,000
it's now actually just going to make you hit harder. Uh, next one, uh, I've got a call on our,

1211
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
one of our content creators, Woody Joe, uh, here, this is why we have a PTR. Uh, he found a neat little

1212
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
oversight that we had with a passive called trick attacks. And I'm actually going to go over this

1213
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,000
in a little bit of detail. Uh, now, right. 39 and three seems completely unranked. So, uh,

1214
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,000
offensive passive is pretty good. So, uh, a little bit background to this. Basically, we change how

1215
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
this passive trick attacks, uh, what it does. It went from something that was more utility based

1216
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
for it was around CC and we turned it into damage, but we didn't update under the hood for like

1217
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
tempering and where it can appear from a utility to a damage recipe of where it would show up. And

1218
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
so it was appearing on utility, which is a lot more, uh, common than damage. And then you could get

1219
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,000
it to silly ranks like this. So, uh, fix this, um, right now, or on the PTR, I should say, it was on

1220
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
this recipe called alchemist control where it was with chilling weight and shadow crash, which

1221
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,000
are also like CC based, uh, passives. Um, four season five launch, we're actually going to be

1222
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
disabling this recipe from dropping. You won't be able to see it for a patch, uh, while we fix this

1223
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,000
bug. And what we're going to do is once we reenable the, the alchemist control recipe to drop,

1224
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
trick attacks won't be on here anymore. Or we're actually going to be doing is we're going to be

1225
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
taking flurry size from another recipe called rogue innovation here. Um, we're going to be moving

1226
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
flurry size, which is more of a utility based thing and moving that over to alchemist control

1227
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
and then just removing trick attacks from alchemist control. So the net effect of this will be that

1228
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
now both recipes will have, or yeah, both temporary recipes will have three different options

1229
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
of what you can have there. And rogue innovation will actually have a little bit of a buff here too

1230
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
because instead of having four things to, you know, roll for your tempers, we're only going to have

1231
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:12,000
three. So it'll be a little bit easier to get what you want. Uh, next, we're going to be talking about,

1232
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
some generic class balance updates. So kind of to set you up a high level thing that we're going

1233
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
to see in our feedback from PTR was barbarians are really, really good. And oh, every other class is

1234
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
kind of a little bit weak. It feels like compared to barbarians. So we did a lot of things to address

1235
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
this. So first, I want to go into detail a little bit of how we feel about barbarians and where

1236
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
they're at and what we want to do. Um, we feel like one of the bigger reasons why barbarians are so

1237
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
strong is that they kind of have two class mechanics compared to other classes, right? They have the

1238
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
expertise system, which is like a normal class mechanic where you know, they have this fantasy of

1239
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
leveling up their weapons and then they get bonuses. But then they also get more item slots

1240
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:54,000
compared to the classes so they get more access to more legendary powers. Um, as far as how we

1241
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,000
tackle this, we don't want our only solution to be the nerf barbarians, right? Like a common thing

1242
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
that we hear is like, hey, they have more item slots. Maybe you should just get rid of the item

1243
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
slots so that everybody has parity, right? Like that is a way to make parity. But you know, it takes

1244
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
away from their theme of being a master of weapons and it's not very fun. Um, so that's not the

1245
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
only thing that we want to do in this situation. Uh, the other thing is that we want to keep their class

1246
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:22,000
identity, right? Um, another common situation we hear is we'll just give all the other classes more

1247
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,000
item slots that they're the same as barbarian, right? And similarly, kind of like how necromancers

1248
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
have minions, we don't want to give every class minions just because, you know, they don't have access

1249
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,000
to the cool thing that necromancers do. We don't want to just give every class, you know, more slots

1250
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
so that they're exactly the same as barbarian. We want to really try and keep what makes them feel

1251
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,000
special as a special thing and find other ways to kind of bring parity to the classes. So here's

1252
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
kind of our strategy of what we're thinking of with barbarians. We have a few different things

1253
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
that we're going to be doing. Uh, one is we're actually going to be adjusting how much damage all

1254
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
the classes get from their core stat. And this is going to bring other classes up to the level

1255
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,000
barbarian. I'm going to be going over that in a little bit. Uh, we are going to be reducing the

1256
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
power of barbarians as part of our solution. But again, I want to point out it's not the only thing

1257
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
that we want to do. And then we also want to target the other class mechanics and really bring them

1258
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
up to the level of the barbarian effective we have in two and making the other classes feel

1259
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
cool in the way that makes them thematic and awesome. Uh, we already actually experimented with this

1260
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
in season four. This was an intentional thing that we did and we wanted to see how it went with

1261
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
the necromancer. Uh, if you remember, we buffed minions very heavily and we also buffed the book

1262
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
of the dead, their class mechanic very heavily, uh, not just numbers, but also in the cool factor,

1263
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
right? You have mechanics like, you know, your minions can throw bone spears or, you know, your

1264
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
golem can do bone spikes everywhere in the enemies vulnerable. We want to do this kind of treatment

1265
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
to the other class mechanics. Uh, just to be clear, we're going to be probably doing this after

1266
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
the vessel of hatred expansion launches. So it'll be a little bit. So we are doing some things in

1267
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
the meantime to catch them up. But you can expect, uh, in the future, we're going to be doing kind of a

1268
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
big overhaul to the other classes similar lead to the book of the dead. And so their cool factor and

1269
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:04,000
their power level is going to be going up. So let's talk about that core stat update that I talked

1270
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
about, uh, previously. So basically what we're doing here is we're going to be changing the amount

1271
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,000
of damage that every class gets from their core stat. So if you didn't know on live right now,

1272
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,000
when you log into the game, you get about 1% more damage per 10 stat of your class. So as an example,

1273
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
you know, the, the, I don't know, pick one, the source, you know, with intelligence, you would

1274
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,000
have 10 int and then you get 1% more damage. If you had 100 int, you'd have 10% more damage and so on.

1275
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So now it's going to actually depend on the class. What that ratio is of how much damage you get per

1276
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
your core stat. So the burberrying is going to be saying exactly the same, uh, 1% more damage per 10

1277
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
strength. The rogue is going to get a little bit above, above, above, above here because they do

1278
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
have a little bit more slots compared to other classes. So they're going to be getting 1% more

1279
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
damage per 9 decks and then the other 3 classes, the sorcerer's druid and necromancer are going to be

1280
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,000
getting 1% more damage per 8 core stat. So, you know, without doing a lot of math, the TLDR here is

1281
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,000
barbarians are staying the same. Uh, rogues are going to get a bit of a bump, a bit of a buff and the

1282
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
other 3 classes are going to get even more damage. So as you get that core stat, which you get very

1283
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
commonly, you know, in gear and paragon and other places, you're just going to be doing more damage.

1284
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It's just a passive way that we're going to be catching up the classes, uh, stat wise.

1285
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,000
So next, let's move on to kind of our class updates. So I'm going to be going through all the different

1286
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
classes and talking about kind of what our updates are going to be for them. Some of the things you can

1287
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:34,000
expect that are different from PTR to launch. So barbarian, um, you know, currently barbarians,

1288
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
in addition to having more item slots, I have some of the best key passives in the game,

1289
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Blackland season 4 and on live. Um, one of the, the very main ways that we're targeting,

1290
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
uh, bringing them down is reducing the power level. So that really their key passes are comparable

1291
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
to other classes. Uh, we on the team felt like, you know, they already have all these other

1292
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:56,000
things are really strong going for them. They don't need like overly-stated, way powerful key passives

1293
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,000
that do like, you know, over 100% multiplicative damage when the other classes are doing way less.

1294
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Um, so you did see that on the PTR. We did see a lot of feedback on like, why are we bringing down

1295
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
walking arsenal to have parity when, you know, it wasn't even really meta compared to the other

1296
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,000
key passes and it's kind of wanted to bring some light to this of how we think about it. Um,

1297
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
the reason why we brought rocking arsenal to be level with the other ones when we brought them to

1298
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
be equal to other classes is that, you know, we want all the key passes on barbarian to have parity

1299
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
with each other. If we just brought down the other key passes that were way overperforming

1300
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
and didn't bring walking arsenal down to be even with them, then really walking arsenal is just

1301
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
going to be the best mandatory pick and every barbarian build is going to have to interact with

1302
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
this system. And we didn't really wanted them to be equal with each other so that, you know, there's

1303
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
actually a choice when you get to your key passive of which one to take. So I just wanted to clarify

1304
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
that of, you know, what our thinking was there. But, you know, it's not all doom and gloom for

1305
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
barbarians. Uh, you know, we did hear feedback of like, man, it really sucks. You know, I understand

1306
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
that they're being brought down and it's fair, but, you know, we want to have some things to look

1307
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
forward to. So we did introduce a number of buffs coming in between PTR on lives that you have

1308
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
some things to look forward to and new bill paths or your, you know, underperforming builds are not

1309
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
being brought down as well. I'm going to give a couple of examples here. One is hammer the

1310
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
ancients. Uh, we increase the damage baseline by 10%. Uh, and we also adjusted the of ancestral force

1311
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,000
legendary. Uh, one of the trouble troubling things that this bill has problems with is like

1312
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
single target damage against bosses and things. You know, it does really good in AOE and brings down

1313
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
enemies, but it's single targets a little bit lacking. So we're upgrading this legendary power. So

1314
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
now it's going to be doing more damage against bosses. So it'll kind of help you with that single

1315
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:40,000
target issue. Uh, another one is upheaval. Uh, upheaval builds can rejoice and also a little bit

1316
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
of a preview of kind of how we're changing uniques, which I'll be going over a lot more later. Uh,

1317
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,000
we're increasing up people damage by about 15%. And we also, uh, rounded out Hellhammer now. It's

1318
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,000
quite a bit more powerful. I can point out a bunch of things here of how it's better, but you

1319
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
can see it gives more skill ranks of upheaval compared to before. Uh, the damage of its burning on

1320
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,000
the ground just baseline went up. It also has scaling on the burning damage. So, you know, before the

1321
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
burning damage wasn't really a meaningful part of the unique. Um, one of the things you're going

1322
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
to see it with the uniques across the board is that they're going to be a lot more about the

1323
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
thematic of what the unique is and that's where their power is going to be. So here the burning

1324
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
ground actually will scale with your strength at a pretty significant degree. So, you know, it'll

1325
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
actually be doing meaningful damage, hopefully. Um, you can also see X-inherent aphics now is

1326
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,000
damaged a burning enemies, um, instead of overpower damage. So it's going with that theme of Hellhammer

1327
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
burning the ground. It's also giving you skill ranks of wall up a passive. So that's more

1328
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
multiplicative damage. You also get a pebble size. So now your burning ground and your upheaval

1329
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,000
is going to be bigger. So there there's just all kinds of new things going on. It's going to be a

1330
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
lot cooler, a lot more powerful. Um, and hopefully a lot more fun. Yeah, Hellhammer. It looks absolutely

1331
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:53,000
insane. Yeah. 300 strength also by the way. Yeah, 300 strength. Yeah. No big deal. No big deal.

1332
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
It's going to be pretty good. Uh, so next the sorceress. Uh, we got a hold on a feedback that,

1333
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
you know, the sorceress isn't powerful enough compared to other classes. We got so much, uh, I

1334
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I'm going to stop us right here. So much feedback about the stuff. Just a little bit and the

1335
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
draw it and the other. And then I'm going to answer. I will just know like we hear you guys. We

1336
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:18,000
absolutely do. Okay, now you may continue. Okay. So, uh, for the sorcerers specifically, we heard

1337
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
feedback that they're not powerful enough. So we did quite a few things to address it. Um,

1338
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
firstly, they've got a lot of large buffs to their uniques. Um, I would say even more than other

1339
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,000
classes, your uniques are going to feel really good, uh, is the hope. And I think we've hit it.

1340
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And I'll be going over some of them a little bit later. Um, we also buffed all of their core

1341
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
mastery skills by about 15 to 20%. So just baseline. Remember, this is in addition to the core

1342
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
stat buff. All of your core mastery skills are also getting buffed baseline, uh, by a pretty

1343
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,000
significant degree. So you're just going to hit harder. Um, we also did multiple defensive buffs.

1344
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
You know, we heard a lot of feedback that they have trouble surviving in situations that the other

1345
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
classes could kind of get away with. Um, these are some examples. We did more than this, but

1346
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
ice armor, your base shield amount is going up from 40% to 50% percent of your max life.

1347
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Uh, snow veiled aspect. This one was updated from PTR to launch. So on PTR, it was that your

1348
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,000
ice armor gave you unstoppable and gave you armor. And on launch, you're still going to get unstoppable,

1349
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
but you're going to get damaged reduction, which, you know, anyone who knows how the defenses

1350
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
within this game work is way more significant than just getting armor. Yeah. When you hit that

1351
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,000
subbing cap, it's kind of like, you just want to gobble up DR like Pac-Man as much as you can get

1352
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
more of the better and this is going to give you the D.I. is going to be huge. Yeah.

1353
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Also, we did multiple buffs to the Paragon board. Again, this is not covering everything. Um,

1354
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
but one of the things is that, you know, we put a lot of caps to make sure that some Paragon

1355
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
doses just didn't go out of control compared to everything else, but we heard feedback that,

1356
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
you know, those caps were a little bit too punishing. So we increased them. An example here is

1357
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
burning instincts where you know, on PTR, it capped at 40% more multiplicative damage,

1358
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
and we increased that up to 80%. So now you're burning damage that's based on your crit strike

1359
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
multiplier is going to be going up. Your total amount is going to go up, but then also the rate

1360
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
that you get it used to be 1% per 50 in. Now it's 1% per 20 in. So you're beginning more efficient

1361
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
bang for your buck for your end and a total cap that's much higher.

1362
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:17,000
So Drew, a similar to Sorcerer is surprise surprise. Got a lot of feedback that it's not powerful

1363
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:23,000
enough compared to the barbarian or other classes. So we've got a lot of multiple quality of life

1364
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
and damage buffs coming in. Again, these are just some examples. Also, you got to remember the

1365
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,000
unique. So you're going to be coming in as well. Boulder damage went up. We increased the damage

1366
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
across the board of their like core skills mostly and we missed boulders. So we're, you know,

1367
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
increasing their damage a bit. We also got a lot of feedback that, you know, we came out with this

1368
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
really cool unique for cataclysm that made the lightning bolts smart and target enemies.

1369
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And then a lot of people were like, Hey, why why does it have to like get a unique to make my skill

1370
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,000
be smart? And we agreed. So we just made the skill smart based line. So now those lightning bolts

1371
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,000
from the ultimate will just target enemies. Perfect storm. The storm key passive is getting

1372
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
xdamage boosted from 30 to 40%. Size makes shift. This was an aspect that we think is really cool

1373
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
where your earth spike kind of goes in a line and does a bunch of earth spikes. You still have a

1374
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
kiss curse mechanic and it no longer does. So before it used to like give you this big bonus of,

1375
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
you know, way more resource reduction and more damage on it. Put it out of the cool down. And

1376
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
now it just doesn't add a cool down so you can spam it and cast a bunch of the first spikes everywhere.

1377
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Should be a lot more fun. Also similar to the sorceress. We're buffing their little bonus cap on

1378
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
their legendary paragon nodes. So an example here, you know, they went from 40 to 60%. So you've got

1379
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
thunder struck earth and devastation and survival instincts. We've got a little visual there.

1380
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
The bottom node, but you can see that that top end of the damage is now 60%. So it's going to be

1381
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
better than PTR. Also, we came out with that new unique I mentioned for cataclysm. It used to be

1382
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
on the gloves on PTR, which a lot of people, which we agreed with, you know, it kind of felt bad

1383
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
that you know, you've got the two storm related unique on the same slot. You can't take them together.

1384
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,000
It was competing with unsun-acetic wraps. This was the lightning storm unique. But now it's

1385
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
going to be on the rain slots. Now you can take them both together so they're not competing with

1386
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:13,000
each other anymore. Next is the rogue. So to be frank, the rogue is, we feel like it's in a pretty

1387
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
good spot. So we didn't do as many changes compared to other classes. We did still do a few that

1388
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I'll mention today, but they got the least changes. The first one is flurry. So as you know, if you play

1389
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
the PTR flurry, you got some pretty dramatic updates, right? Both of their enhancement and both

1390
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
of their choices that you could pick on the base skill got changed and made a lot better.

1391
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:40,000
We saw that a lot of the output of flurry was related to doing the mechanics that the enhancement

1392
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and the advanced flurry were requiring to do, like Cassie had a bunch of times in her own stuff

1393
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
like that. And we wanted to move some of that damage from those enhancements and things into

1394
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
the base skill. So the enhancement and the advance for her is still going to be pretty potent,

1395
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
but we lowered their damage and instead just use the base skill even more. And what this is going

1396
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
to mean is really just that you're going to be more consistently doing that damage and you're going

1397
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,000
to be less reliant on doing the stacking mechanics to get it. Next, Win Force. You know, this one has

1398
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
had a troubled history of just trying to find ways to make it really good and useful. Instead of

1399
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
knocking back enemies when it prox, it's going to knock them down now. So you no longer have to worry

1400
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
about like knocking enemies out of your CC, you know, or you want them to be grouped up next to you

1401
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
and then you're just knocking one of them or a few of them away. Now they're just going to go in

1402
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
place. We have a before and after here. Again, a little preview of what we're doing with our

1403
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Uniques. But yeah, Win Force, you can see some of the things here as a preview is going to give you

1404
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
move speed baseline, which is a pretty interesting. There's a stat on a bow. You've got chance for

1405
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
double projectiles for your barrage. You've got a couple of passive upgrades there. And then as

1406
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
you can see, the damage went up but also now it knocks down enemies instead of knocks them back.

1407
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Last but not least, the Necromancer. We've been hearing off feedback that Blood Necromancer

1408
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
players are a little sad. They just aren't really catching up to the other versions of Necromancer.

1409
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
So we've buffed up a bunch of their tempering recipes and the damage on them. We're also buffing

1410
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
their legendary Paragon nodes. Here's something here that we did a Bloodbath. This one just makes

1411
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:10,000
your overpowered damage go up. It's being doubled from 35% to 70%. So that's pretty meaty. Blood

1412
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,000
gets blood. That damage bonus when you're picking up Blood Orbs is being doubled and the maximum

1413
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
amount is being doubled. So you're getting more Perstack and you need less stats to get to your max

1414
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
damage. So pretty good there. And then last but not least here, Lucky Hit. We've heard a lot of

1415
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
feedback from Necromancer players that they kind of rely a lot on the Miyazma Corpse explosion to

1416
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
get their Lucky Hit prox off and that there are other skills don't really compete. And so they

1417
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:40,000
can't really have fun with Lucky Hit based builds more generally. So we just buffed Lucky Hit on a

1418
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
bunch of different skills so you can see there what all the numbers are. Again, those will be on

1419
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
the patch notes but really they're just going to be Lucky Hit more often and getting cool prox more.

1420
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
All right. So next let's talk about Uniques a little bit. We've got a lot of

1421
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:01,000
things coming up. As we promised in the PTR stream, we said that we had this kind of different

1422
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
philosophy when it comes to Uniques and we went into detail there and we updated our Uniques coming

1423
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
into season five but we didn't update all of our existing Uniques in the game yet. So we've done

1424
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
that pass now. We've updated nearly every Unique in the game and I'm going to do a little bit of

1425
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
a recap of how we thought and then giving you some examples of what we did. So these updates are

1426
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
fairly dramatic. They'll be showing you three from each class as well as three generic ones to

1427
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
give you a really medium idea of the different categories and ways that we thought of updating Uniques

1428
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:33,000
and kind of what you can expect for your builds. Yeah and I know and Marcus is going to remind us

1429
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:39,000
about this at the end as well. You'll be hearing it a lot. But I will say we are showing three here

1430
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:46,000
and three for every class and three generic ones but every single Unique is actually in the

1431
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
patch notes and we have it before and after in the patch notes so you guys will have easy access

1432
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,000
and you can easily compare the two and see what's the difference. So after the stream you'll be

1433
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
able to compare and so we're just only covering a small amount here. We'll see everything.

1434
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Just a little sample serving. Patch notes are absolutely massive so you'll have a lot too.

1435
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:11,000
That would be pretty close to that. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, so one of the things is your general

1436
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
power level of Unique affects is up and by Unique affects I want to be clear. That is like the

1437
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:21,000
thing at the bottom that is like your you know deals 40 to 60% more multiplicative damage or whatever.

1438
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
That number is going to be up on the higher end so instead of 40 to 60 you know it will be 40 to 80

1439
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
or 40 to 9 year 40 to whatever right. So that power level is just going to be generally up almost

1440
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:36,000
across the board and then really what we targeted for these updates is the stats on the Uniques.

1441
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So the stats are going to pretty much break every rule that we had in the game before when it

1442
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
comes to being a cool item. So some things that you're going to see and I think I got an example

1443
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,000
of most of if not all these but you're going to see Uniques that have different inherits compared to

1444
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,000
other stats. So you know your boot inherent you know could be something that's not even related to

1445
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
boots or movement anymore could be something else or sometimes we had more inherent stats.

1446
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
So something that didn't exist before you know some items can have two inherits instead of just one

1447
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,000
which is a pretty big difference. We have a lot more that have stats that break normal slot rules

1448
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
so you know things like movement speed on bows or cooldown reduction on weapons stuff like that.

1449
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Uniques also can now have tempering affixes right none of them really did this at the in season 4

1450
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
but now the tempering is in the game and Uniques have to compete with these really great tempered

1451
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
items Uniques can have that too. They can also have much higher potential stat values compared

1452
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
to normal items. So you know if a normal item has 20 to 40% more damage a unique can be like you

1453
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:37,000
know one to 300% more damage or whatever right and we even do this with the tempered affixes. So

1454
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
you need to have juiced up versions of tempered affixes that make them solve those problems much

1455
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:46,000
quicker. Also we've introduced a lot of stats that really have powerful effects on them.

1456
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Sometimes even a single stat on Unique can have the impact that a legendary power normal we would

1457
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
on an item as far as what it does to a build and we'll have a couple examples of that where like

1458
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,000
a stat on an item is actually giving you a new effect that that didn't exist before that you could do.

1459
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Yeah so again we're going to be going through three examples per class and three generics and

1460
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I'm going to just try and quickly go through and kind of point out some of the the key things that

1461
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
are kind of neat about the items. So we're going to shock on this a little bit and yeah you can see

1462
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:23,000
some cool items. So let's get to it. Yeah so first penitent grieves this is a generic unique you

1463
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
can see here this one now has two inheritance as opposed to one. Another thing that you can notice

1464
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
is that normally you know the inherent the evaded grants more moves speed is only for one second

1465
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
and this one is not only has two inheritance but it's for two seconds. So you'll evade and like you

1466
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
know boost around that crazy sonic speed for a couple seconds which is pretty neat and now you can

1467
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,000
run through enemies while you do it. We've also got some neat stats there like crit chance against

1468
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,000
chilled enemies and chill potency there that are that are new to the game. Here Fissa Fethis one a

1469
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:56,000
lot of people saw a little bit early and they were very happy about. So one thing I think that's

1470
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
kind of cool is that with our unique we're really trying to like double and triple down on the

1471
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
fantasy of the item. So you know something's about cold or something here like this the fate is

1472
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,000
about like RNG to the max. So we're really going hard on like what the theme is. So here you can

1473
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
see like your tax speed can go from point one to point seven and everything on it is like has a

1474
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
huge range of what you can roll. So like a greater affix to fix the fate could be like a best

1475
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
and slot item for a lot of builds. So the lucky hit chance on this. Yes this is the one that people

1476
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
point out that we it's just crazy. I talked with our one of the praise broader team. I want to shout

1477
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
out Alex our team who did a lot of this work and we had a choice here and we're like are we

1478
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:38,000
going to go crazy or go conservative like you know this is go crazy like this might be insane.

1479
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It might actually be best in slot and break stuff but it's really cool. So yeah greater affix

1480
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,000
grissa fissa fate there is going to be really cool. Next the grandfather mythic unique example

1481
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
here. You know a lot of people had issues with the ignored durability loss. You know where you

1482
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
would like master work hit that or something and then you're not getting anything we just move that

1483
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
into be a you know a baseline inherent affix now. So you don't have to worry about that and then

1484
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:05,000
replace it with something useful with a max resource. And I will note like even in season four

1485
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:12,000
because that durability loss was kind of was actually hidden stat item sometimes when you found

1486
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:17,000
a greater affix version of a grandfather. Yeah yeah yeah it would actually apply to that that

1487
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,000
that that is now. Yeah that's all done. And here it can't be greater. It's something that we

1488
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
thought of a lot with this. Yeah. Yeah so now let's go into the classes of barbarian. This is

1489
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
battle trance. This one exists already on live. Probably the the two big things here one is you

1490
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
know you have two different passives now that you get a lot of times we're adding skill ranks to

1491
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,000
passives because that's a way to add multiplicative damage or just buffs to really cool effects on a

1492
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,000
unique the other stats. The other thing to point out here is the actual effect before it was giving

1493
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
you increase attack speed to all the other skills when you had frenzy stacks. Now you're going to be

1494
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
getting damage and attack speed. You know we heard a lot feedback from players that it they would hit a

1495
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
attack speed cap and then this unique wasn't really doing very much for them. So now you're also

1496
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
just going to get damage in addition to making it easier to hit that cap for your other skills.

1497
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:11,000
So it's just you know more stats stronger. Next reign of the raveness a couple things here one is

1498
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
xk giving you skill ranks of rend which is pretty significant and remember that two to three might

1499
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:20,000
not seem so significant but when you greater affix that and then master work it like your potential

1500
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:26,000
of more damage on this goes up very significantly. We're also giving you skill ranks of brawling skills

1501
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
thing to point out here is your rends duration. This will also just increase the throughput damage

1502
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,000
of it has been doubled. So that's just more damage on rend in addition to the skill ranks and then

1503
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:42,000
also at the bottom small little detail but before you can only apply that special effect of your

1504
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,000
brawling skills applying your rends bleed every four seconds and now it's every second. So now if

1505
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
you're able to spam brawling skills you're just going to be applying rend bleeds to enemies and

1506
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:57,000
stronger rend bleeds like crazy. So it's a pretty big power boost. Next the fields of crimson

1507
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
the thing that we want to call out here I mean there's a lot of things that are kind of unique and

1508
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,000
different but is that one kind of rule that we had with item stats that we're now changing and

1509
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,000
breaking is we never really buff the things like enhancements or like the a b like the different

1510
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,000
choice upgrades that you can do for a skill. This one actually buffs enhanced ruptures explosion

1511
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
size. So normally when you're up to an enemy it does that explosion. This will make that explosion

1512
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
be way bigger. So it's kind of a neat way that we can manipulate player power via stats.

1513
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Next let's move on to the sorceress. So the staff of endless rage we actually have a combo here

1514
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
that we're going to show a little video of before and after with this. Fireball builds. The staff

1515
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
now does some and the gloves would be doing some unique things to fireballs. One is butt plus

1516
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000
fireball projectile speed. So this is actually going to make your fireballs fly through the air

1517
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
faster or bounce quicker and so you'll be able to get through them and they'll you know finish

1518
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
their path faster. You've got the tempering recipe now so it doesn't compete with your chance to cast

1519
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:02,000
twice and you can see there it goes up to 75% just on that one stat. So it basically almost solves it

1520
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
for you by itself which is pretty huge. You've got some massive skill ranks to fireballs so now

1521
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,000
again way more multiplicative damage than before and then you know you see at the bottom that the

1522
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,000
upper end of that damage is going up per the same as most of our uniques. And next it's combos

1523
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:23,000
with the gloves of the illuminator. A couple things to to kind of glow down here is the fireball

1524
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
fireball attack speed is going up by a much bigger amount than other classes or than normal attack

1525
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:35,000
speeds. Sorry on other slots. Also you get mana when fireball explodes. I played with this build and

1526
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I think it was season one and I constantly ran into mana issues because you always want to spam

1527
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,000
this as much as you can. So when you think of this stat you know you can greater this you can

1528
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:49,000
tempt or master work this and you kind of combine you combine you combine this with the attack speed

1529
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,000
here and then you combine it with the projectile speed. Yeah and you get a lot more fireballs and

1530
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,000
remember every time that it explodes which when you when it bounces exploding. Yeah and when you're

1531
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
splitting and getting more for multiple projectiles you're getting more bounce explosions so it's

1532
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:08,000
giving you a resource engine. Yeah you're essentially a fireball machine gun. Yeah so we've got a

1533
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,000
little bit of a season four to season five comparison here of what it looks like. A little video

1534
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:17,000
so in season four you can see you know every third cast gives you three but season five you're

1535
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:22,000
gonna randomly get three three and then sometimes even more when it combines with the double project

1536
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,000
isle bonus. So you can actually really fill up your screen with with fireballs everywhere and

1537
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,000
every one of those bounces is giving you mana back to to cast more. That's ludicrous. So it's it's

1538
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:38,000
pretty cool. It's its own little engine. Next we've got blue rows. Probably the cool thing to

1539
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,000
point out here is there's a shafts for ice spikes to explode twice. So this is also something that

1540
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
we haven't really done where we have these we call them subpowers internally but you know these

1541
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,000
things like dust doubles or ice spikes that are like powers that generate when you cast a skill

1542
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
that are usually through legendaries or uniques. We generally don't manipulate them too heavily

1543
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
like this but we're going to be experimenting more with that in unique stat affixes. So here you

1544
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
know your ice spikes can actually like double proc so they get you know double explosions and then

1545
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
any other things that would proc off that would be doubled which is pretty neat.

1546
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:17,000
And next let's move on to the druid. So waxing gibbess this is the shred to druid unique.

1547
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
So what we did here that I want to point out you know in addition to the fact that you're getting a

1548
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
budget skill ranks a shred and toxic's clause which is a bunch more multiplicative damage. So power

1549
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,000
level is going up significantly is blood howl grants stealth for a few seconds. So what's really

1550
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,000
cool about this is you know we basically added a new mechanic via a simple item stat in this unique

1551
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:42,000
and it combines with the unique effect right. So before on live you know you kill enemies with shred

1552
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
you go into stealth and then you come out and you guarantee crit. So as you're killing enemies over

1553
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,000
and over you're just creating constantly as you go in and out stealth but you couldn't really do

1554
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
that against bosses you had no other ways to get into stealth but now we've created an alternative

1555
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:58,000
way where if you cast blood howl or get the blood howl effect another ways you'll go into stealth

1556
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
and get this proc and now you can get this you know against single bosses or situations you couldn't

1557
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
before. So you we've given you a potential way to create your own engine which is pretty neat to

1558
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:13,000
get those infinite crits. Next great staff of the crown I believe we showed this one earlier to

1559
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
people but what just wanted to point out you know what was special about this storm strike chaining

1560
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
to additional targets you know things like this again it's a single stat that does something that

1561
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
kind of really changes how the unique works right. It's gonna you're gonna get all the different

1562
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:30,000
procs and different effects by chaining to more enemies more often. You can also see here that the

1563
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
upper end of that damage that you could get is going up from 150% to 200 so it's just better.

1564
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
And last but not least we got storms companion this one I again wanted to highlight another new

1565
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:47,000
thing that we're doing and I want to call it here is the lucky hit chance for the pack leader spirit

1566
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:53,000
so normally we never really manipulate class mechanics but here you know this pack leader this

1567
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
isn't like a passive or a thing the skill tree this isn't the spirit boon your class mechanic

1568
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
and this increases that lucky hit chance to get a reset on cool down on the cool downs of all your

1569
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,000
companion skills. So again this is something that you know normally we don't get to manipulate and

1570
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
now you'll be able to to do and I think it'll be pretty cool. We have also decided that pack leader

1571
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:17,000
is two words instead of one. Yeah everything's getting up. Yeah everything everything's everything's

1572
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:25,000
changing. All right moving on to the rogue eagle horn let me see what did I want to I think just

1573
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:31,000
pointing out here this was about moving the the tempered recipe the penetrating shot project

1574
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
all this can cast twice again another example of that and we're also giving you a bunch of

1575
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,000
skill ranks the penetrating shot again this is a way that we're adding just like raw power and

1576
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:45,000
damage in ways that aren't in the unique effect. So these stats on these things can be very strong

1577
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:49,000
out the gate and then again tempering and master working just makes these go go really really high.

1578
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Next word of a con this one was a really silly fun one that we liked um you see there the one

1579
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I want to point out well one is the ultimate damage actually ultimate skill damage for the rogue

1580
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
is kind of a premium because they have that paragon node that makes it turn into multiplicative

1581
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
damage for all your skills so that's actually pretty meaty. Um it's also way higher value than normal

1582
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:16,000
also the chance for rain of arrows waves to cast twice. So normally we don't do you know

1583
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:21,000
chance to double cast on ultimate but again unique gets to break the rules so now you've got

1584
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,000
you know juiced up rain of arrows cool down reduction they can cast twice and they hit way harder

1585
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
on the rain of arrows themed unique. So again really trying to bring out the theme and the the

1586
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
fantasy of these unique in the stats in the effects to really create something special.

1587
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
And next savage were a sign it I was running this in season four I'm a little sad that I'm going

1588
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:46,000
to be doing something else in season five but I loved my stun grenade build but here you can see

1589
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
a bunch of grenade damage obvious theme for the grenade build we're also giving you a lot of

1590
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:55,000
your stun grenade size here and then again a new afic that kind of creates your own engine you're

1591
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
getting plus one energy when a stun grenade explodes and this is each individual grenade right so

1592
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,000
usually release a cluster of these things so now again I spent a lot of my time in season four

1593
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,000
trying to solve resource and get ways to to cast us a lot to throw out the stun grenades and now

1594
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:15,000
this kind of create helps us own engine. Also one thing to point out here is that it's no longer

1595
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:20,000
just a flurry unique it's casting a core skill throws still grenades so it's a lot more

1596
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
generically applicable you can use this with you know all the different core skills not just flurry.

1597
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Next necromancer the big one I wanted to point out here we're going to be showing both of the

1598
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,000
blood surge uniques and how they've been updated and they combo with each other we have a stat

1599
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:41,000
here that blood surge drains more times from elites so to be clear this is the drain not the explosion

1600
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
but the drain does feed into the explosion damage and there's a lot of like synergy and things

1601
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:50,000
based on draining enemies so now you know one of the problems that blood surge has always had is

1602
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
when you're fighting a single target or a boss you know you only drain one enemy and then you're

1603
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,000
not getting your like explosion damage up but now you're going to be draining multiple times from

1604
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:03,000
those elites you're getting getting you know more life back and other prox when you drain but also

1605
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:09,000
your explosion will be more significant now against them. Next death speakers pennant this is the

1606
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,000
other blood surge unique we also added another thing that combines with the other unique where you're

1607
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,000
getting essence per enemy drained right and so now as you drain enemies for the explosion you're

1608
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
going to be getting more essence back to cast the skill and spam it more and we're also giving

1609
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:29,000
you a bunch of ranks to blood surge which you know just makes sense so you know 50% you know before

1610
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
master working in tempering multiple creative damage is already a giant buff to this but then also

1611
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
you can see that you know the number is also went up on this as well so it's just going to be

1612
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:44,000
going to be pretty significant. Can't wait and last but not least grieves of the empty tomb this is

1613
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:50,000
your sever unique lots of stuff to point out here one is you have multiple inherits so you know

1614
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:55,000
normally you can only get three max of h charges you get more here we also had a fun little thing where

1615
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
you're a vade now these behind desiccrated ground because this is the desiccrated ground unique

1616
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,000
we also have chance for sever projectiles to cast twice we have sever size here we also give you

1617
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
ranks to reapers pursuits so this is really about just like moving in groovin like going around

1618
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
one thing I want to point out here as well is this new aspect of creeping mist that came in and

1619
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,000
you can combine this with the grieves of the empty tomb so this new aspect you know we heard that

1620
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Nuckert players want mobility and boy did we give you mobility so what this does is when you

1621
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:31,000
evade during first one you get a vague cool down reduction so you evade more but when you evade

1622
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,000
during blood mist you travel twice as far and both when you enter and exit blood mist it

1623
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
resects your evade cool down and one of the things that makes this crazy where we might actually

1624
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
be crazy and I hope we don't have to revisit this but we're going to see is that that reset of

1625
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,000
your vade cool down counts for all of your charges of evade so what this means is and we have a video

1626
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:56,000
is that you can evade five times then evade in blood mist and then evade five more times

1627
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
so see here then you're evading in blood mist and you're leaving behind that desiccrated

1628
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
ground everywhere and just moving around you know yeah it's like a nice skating right so every

1629
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,000
time you cast blood mist you're going to be getting ten of aides it's silly and hilarious um

1630
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
but we're playing it in the game and I hope we don't regret it

1631
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Nekros are going to be zoom it yeah they're going to be zooming with this so wow

1632
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
yeah so that's kind of our preview of our uniques and kind of what's coming into the game again

1633
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
we're pretty excited about it I think it's going to be pretty cool yeah but yeah professor Adam

1634
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Jackson take him bow that is that is incredible and again that's not even everything there's a lot

1635
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
of stuff that we need to do at that level patch notes after the stream we will be showing

1636
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
comparison to every single unique in their changes from season 40 season five

1637
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
so you can go in there and check it all those changes but that was a great great overview

1638
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:49,000
of all those changes that is really really exciting uh this brings us to our Q&A portion of the show

1639
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,000
let's all shift our legs at the same time yeah yeah uh so we've been following along in twitch chat

1640
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
and we've picked out a bunch of questions and we're going to kick it off tossing it over to Mr. Dan Tangoey

1641
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,000
how do reward choices work in multiplayer parties for infernal hordes does the leader choose

1642
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:12,000
their award for everyone or can each player choose all right so yeah let's talk about this um in

1643
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:18,000
the infernal hordes when you're collecting burning aether uh each individual collects their own

1644
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
burning ether and we did this for the very reason that you're you're asking questions about we

1645
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,000
wanted players to be able to go in and choose the rewards that they want to choose not necessarily

1646
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
what somebody else gets to first or what the party leader wants so every individual party member

1647
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
will have their own choice at rewards awesome awesome thanks for the honest though

1648
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,000
um mark is you got to read the names oh my goodness did i did i not say no trick

1649
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
there is right i won't forget you thank you out of him

1650
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
aldrick thank you for that question

1651
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,000
i'll be in question or is it stickler for that view yeah no it's a great thing to call out

1652
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,000
because our next question is from dartless oh actually i think we have a question here on the

1653
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,000
the the lower third which is uh this one this one i we've gotten a lot of these questions so i do

1654
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
when i actually addressed this one this is when are we going to hear more about vessel of hatred

1655
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
because you know you know we just had the spirit born reveal we we showed off the spirit born i

1664
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:57,000
come to clon come to clon um there was some people confused and chat uh this is a question from

1665
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:02,000
dartless who was saying we can temper unique's now did i miss hear that maybe that was a mistake

1666
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:07,000
being said so yeah hundred times clear cannot temper unique's we want them to be different in that

1667
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:13,000
they do not engage with that system at least for now um but no you're going to be what we what

1668
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,000
i wanted to say or be clarified is that you can get tempering aphixes on unique's like they

1669
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,000
they'll just drop with those aphixes or whatever but you can't like go to the to the box with them

1670
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:27,000
and maybe lay them in that way you can't temper them not you cool cool thanks for clarifying that

1671
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:35,000
uh at um yeah do do do do uh it's doffy has a question for a dantangue are there any plans to

1672
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:40,000
continue iterating on the infernal hordes in the future since it's a permanent addition are

1673
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:48,000
there going to be more boons and bains coming yeah that's uh uh a great question and yeah just to

1674
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,000
reiterate what you'd pointed out there uh this is an eternal realm feature that's going to appear

1675
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,000
in the game forevermore and so this is just the first version of it i mean you think back to

1676
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:05,000
what hell tide was in the base game and how we've iterated on that over time to get it to where it is

1677
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,000
uh we're going to continue investing similar levels of effort into the infernal hordes too

1678
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:17,000
and so uh boons and bains is something we heard a lot about uh feedback uh during the ptr

1679
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:24,000
and so we absolutely want to make more improvements to the uh the boons and bains and so stay tuned

1680
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:31,000
that's not going to hit in season five uh but we'll we'll figure out where we can get it in in

1681
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:35,000
future seasons awesome great to hear that we're going to continue uh tinkering on that feature in

1682
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:41,000
the in the seasons to come uh got a really interesting question from Mano underscore imp

1683
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,000
with regards to those mano imp we know mano with regards to the damage increase per class resource

1684
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
they're asking is the spirit borne getting one percent damage at seven points if it's their

1685
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,000
main stat uh just because they have a lower amount of weapons yeah uh tbd tbd i don't want to go

1686
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:02,000
on a map on spirit borne yet but uh they'll be getting similar treatment to all the other stuff

1687
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:11,000
all of this is kind of evergreen so awesome awesome uh luke we luke we uh when will we see the

1688
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:17,000
overhaul of the paragon system uh would you consider removing the paragon limit uh

1689
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:24,000
there are going to be changes to paragon but we aren't talking about uh those changes

1690
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:32,000
awesome yep awesome tbd tbd stay tuned uh love this name chicken wing 929 uh

1691
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:38,000
can the reputation rewards for season season the infernal hordes be earned on only one character or

1692
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:45,000
all your seasonal characters um i believe it's uh uh uh all characters similar to what we have for

1693
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,000
season four uh so you can actually go back in and just play like hey go through the reputation

1694
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:56,000
board and then uh get another respondent's bark you want to have a question really that's

1695
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:02,000
truly the question yeah yeah so you can you can get pretty sure it's church yeah yeah yeah nice

1696
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:11,000
um systematic 5k atom Jackson will our existing uniques be updated with these new unique changes

1697
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
yeah we we get this everywhere on that we update that makes the same rules as always which is

1698
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:21,000
the unique power when we update that is your your existing uniques will get that right so when

1699
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:26,000
we increase your damage range or whatever that's going to get but the stats those are going to be

1700
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:31,000
legacy on any items that exist so you're going to have to re-farm your unique to get the new stats

1701
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
that are on them and that's kind of the way that they're going to work going forward

1702
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,000
unless you say otherwise yeah it's it's just how things work under the hood um from when we do changes

1703
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:50,000
on them so yeah nice um pudge uh pudge underscore BP are there any plans for clan rework slash

1704
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:57,000
improvements um there are i know there are some uh changes coming for uh some social features we're

1705
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:04,000
just not ready to talk about them now uh but you'll you guys will hear about them soon awesome awesome

1706
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:11,000
uh this one's kind of a design philosophy question for atom Jackson sure Evan's 423 wants to know

1707
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
how future proof is the system of static uniques when adding new slash better tempering effects

1708
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:22,000
in new content how future proof or static uniques when adding new tempers um let me think

1709
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:30,000
semi right because like i think it is something where if we add like new tempers or new

1710
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,000
affixes or whatever we will probably need to go back and update uniques that that we wanted to

1711
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:41,000
apply to and make it you know work again um our hope is that these uniques are going to be pretty

1712
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
like future proof in that they're going to be very meaty in the amount of power that they give you

1713
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
um they're also extremely thematic but i think we do reserve the right like if hey if we find a new

1714
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,000
idea for uh existing passive or existing tempering that that is introduced to the game and we

1715
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
want to put it on we we can do that um i will say also one thing that we want to do more is like

1716
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,000
just come up with really crazy new ones and aren't even really tempering recipes but just like

1717
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:08,000
crazy effects right like blood howl grand stealth or you drain more with your you know blood

1718
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
search stuff like that so i would expect we'll probably be updating them as we go forward not

1719
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:18,000
probably as dramatically as this all at once but i i foresee this probably likely yeah nice yeah

1720
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,000
always tinkering always updating uh yeah speaking which uh about tempering one thing that we forgot

1721
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
to mention and i know we mentioned it the ptr stream last time i'm sorry my earpiece just keeps falling

1722
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:34,000
off uh so it's like i'm like scratching my ear but i'm not uh the uh greater af i know there's a lot

1723
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,000
of like feedback after season four regarding um uh tempering and potentially breaking items and

1724
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
one update that we talked about during the ptr stream and i want to mention it wasn't in ptr but

1725
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:52,000
is in uh season five specifically is uh greater aphixes will actually get additional

1726
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:59,000
temperary roles on them based on the greater aphix you know quality of of what they are so uh for

1727
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:04,000
for um like like greater aphix one star ones you'll end up getting one additional temperary

1728
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:10,000
role yeah um and then it grows by how many stars that there are so that is going in season five so

1729
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,000
and i i we mentioned it last time i just wanted to reiterate it's like actually for out you

1730
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,000
should mention it sweet stuff yeah great great to mention that item that's awesome uh we've got a uh

1731
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:25,000
easy one here from z weapons uh what is a mythic unique there was a purple item

1732
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,000
yeah you could tune into our last three four but yeah um basically what was uber unique

1733
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
there's what people call them um it's basically like you know the really best items in the game

1734
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
that have like perfect stats and everything we rebranded them to mythic uniques they now have

1735
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,000
their own special color special beam when they drop they just got a whole treatment to really

1736
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,000
make them feel like the the penultimate items that that they are pretty good yeah yeah that's

1737
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:54,000
awesome uh so fees zero two five seven uh are they going to make it so that we can pre-download the

1738
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
update or will it be available only on the sixth that's a great question let's go based off uh feedback

1739
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,000
from season four's launch the patch will be available to download roughly an hour before season

1740
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
three infernal hordes launches so that season goes live at ten am and roughly an hour before

1741
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
you'll be able to pre-download the patch to get into the game and get ready for the season yeah

1742
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
i know i know a lot of people are probably going like we're not multiple days and things like that

1743
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:22,000
we're getting there we're trying no i know it's it's it's uh we we got a lot of feedback about you

1744
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
know how things started immediately on the like you could download and actually start the season

1745
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
of course we want to make sure that people can be as prepared as possible so uh one hour before the

1746
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
season starts like you should be able to actually download and get that all prepared so like soon

1747
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:43,000
is uh the season the the time for the season began which is roughly like ten a and a specific on

1748
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:48,000
on the day of uh you you can just jump in and without needing to download so yeah yeah

1749
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:56,000
uh skull mtv hey great job thanks uh any plans to rework master working and back it's higher cost

1750
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:03,000
but you know you can choose upgrades and tempering to make these systems have less rng um nothing to

1751
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:07,000
announce at this time uh we definitely have heard the feedback we are starting with the first step of

1752
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:13,000
like you know one of the things that we know feels really bad for players like i got a uh how do i say

1753
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,000
the more greater affixes you have on an item the higher stress and investment you have to like make

1754
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,000
it work the way that you want so we are relaxing that make it a little bit easier um another thing

1755
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:27,000
we're thinking about that's a little wider is like the tempering recipes making them have like

1756
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,000
the rion average instead of four more um some that we're talking about moving towards but nothing like

1757
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,000
of overhauling the system and doing a major change at this time that we have to announce cool thanks

1758
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Adam uh dan tangway from holy smokes uh their name isn't for holy smokes their name is dan

1759
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,000
i thought i was dan tangway asking a question and i was like wait what no no no uh their name is

1760
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:57,000
froto boulson froto boulson but all the ozer zeros uh how does the infernal hordes work in groups

1761
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:04,000
uh do you need one come only one compass per group um so the infernal hordes you only need one

1762
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:10,000
compass per group in order to be able to get in yeah sweet just like uh niamaric dungeon sigils

1763
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:16,000
awesome all right revask any news on reworked niamaric dungeons

1764
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:26,000
nothing nothing to announce nothing to announce yeah sweet uh greens on b studios can we expect

1765
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:33,000
cool new trans mox and season five from salvaging items um i am not sure i know like wait the

1766
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:40,000
the season five does have over has a lot of new legendary aspects and unique like there's like

1767
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:46,000
fifty new legendary aspects and you expect to be added into season five so there's a lot of

1768
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,000
of like uh more the the the back end type of stuff that that affects a more so on the gameplay

1769
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:59,000
but i'm not exactly sure if there's a ton coming up uh so we can actually uh there are a couple of

1770
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,000
new uniques and help uh that you can earn that will have all new looks to them that you can sell

1771
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:11,000
the jerry go oh how's magic yep bam there you go dan the savior from albany there you go

1772
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:19,000
brodo bolson uh hot pancakes are there still plans for rare in magic items i guess in terms of

1773
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,000
like a a rework or changing their functionality in any way yeah i'd say uh nothing to announce today

1774
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:35,000
for that yeah cool nice do do do do do all right uh check through mac and d's uh can we expect

1775
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:43,000
skill trees or support gems to change the way skills work can we expect skill trees or support gems

1776
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,000
to change the way the skill works i mean we're not doing any skill tree overhaul right now in season five

1777
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:53,000
um i do think we have talked a bit on on the team about having the desire of the upgrades for

1778
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:59,000
skills being like more impactful and really impactful um nothing to announce today but it is

1779
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,000
something that is on our radar and i think it's cool i think one example that that we talk about

1780
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,000
along the team is like the kick upgrade for the barbarian where normally you know when we

1781
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,000
originally designing kick it was this idea that you have this like skill where you hit an enemy you

1782
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
care about the geometry of the place around you you want to hit them into the wall and then they

1783
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000
get knocked down take a bunch of damage and all this stuff um that part hasn't really played i

1784
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,000
think as well because the pace of our game is so fast but one of the upgrades for kick um especially

1785
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:30,000
i remember in the early beta like way before maybe it was alpha even um kick you know it converts

1786
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:35,000
kick from this cool down based geometry skill into just a powerhouse where it just spends all your

1787
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:40,000
resource and does a buttload of damage to it enemy um and it was like one-shotting world bosses and

1788
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,000
stuff like it was it was hilarious i think i remember that but the skill still has that upgrade but

1789
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:49,000
i referenced that upgrade a lot because i think it's really cool when you can convert a skill to like

1790
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:55,000
used to be cool down and now isn't or used to be about this utility and now it's just damage or

1791
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,000
vice versa where like really changes what a skill does um we think it's really cool uh it

1792
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,000
definitely would be a lot of work to like do that to every skill but i think it's something that's

1793
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,000
worth talking about and pursuing so it is on our radar something to do but nothing to announce today

1794
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:13,000
for awesome that's really cool things out of yeah uh that brings us to the end of our q&a so i
