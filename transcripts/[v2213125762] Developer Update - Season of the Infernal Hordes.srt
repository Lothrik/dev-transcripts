1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
you

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
so

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you.

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Thank you.

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you.

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you.

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you.

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thank you.

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you.

14
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you.

15
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you.

16
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Thank you.

17
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you.

18
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Thank you.

19
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you.

20
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you.

21
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you.

22
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you.

23
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you.

24
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you.

25
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you.

26
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you.

27
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you.

28
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you.

29
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Thank you.

30
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Thank you.

31
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Thank you.

32
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you.

33
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thank you.

34
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Thank you.

35
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Thank you.

36
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Thank you.

37
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you.

38
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Thank you.

39
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Thank you.

40
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Thank you.

41
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Thank you.

42
00:20:30,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Thank you.

43
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Thank you.

44
00:21:30,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you.

45
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Thank you.

46
00:22:30,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You're going to be

47
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah.

48
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
mode that we want to make sure you're playing over and over again.

49
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So we really wanted to create a broad set of enemies for you

50
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
to fight during this mode.

51
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We've got many demons to choose from in the lexicon

52
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
of Diablo's monster families.

53
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But we're also going to see some other foes you might not expect.

54
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
There are going to be certain types of enemies, like goatmen,

55
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
who have been banished to hell that have now rallied to Mephisto

56
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and fight by his side.

57
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And even some unlucky souls that marched on hell

58
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
from the Cathedral of Light have now been revived in hell

59
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and fight against you alongside the demons.

60
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Basically, everything that hell has to throw at you,

61
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
we're throwing it at you this season.

62
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
The Infernal Hordes has been built with multiplayer in mind,

63
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
but multiplayer is not required.

64
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We want to make sure that solo players still

65
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
have a very fun experience in the Infernal Hordes.

66
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Now, that said, if you roll in with a party,

67
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
you're going to have a lot of fun.

68
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
This game mode is going to appear in the Eternal

69
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
and in the Seasonal Realm.

70
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And that means that once the season is over,

71
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
it's here to stay.

72
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The Infernal Hordes is unlocked at World Tier 3.

73
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So really what you need to do to access it

74
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
is earn your way up to World Tier 3

75
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and then complete an Eternal quest line that takes you back

76
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
to hell and then unlocks the Infernal Hordes.

77
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
For World Tier 1 and 2 players,

78
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
we've built out a seasonal progression

79
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
that'll help them become more powerful in order

80
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
to be able to confront the Infernal Hordes.

81
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
First is you can earn reputation,

82
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and that reputation applies to a reputation track that earns

83
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
lots of really cool rewards that'll make you more powerful

84
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
as you progress onto World Tier 3.

85
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The other thing we've built are micro dungeons called

86
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Hell Breaches that offer a glimpse at the Infernal Hordes

87
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
mechanics.

88
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And they give you a chance to learn the mechanics

89
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
before you confront the Infernal Hordes at World Tier 3.

90
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The final boss in this season is the Fel Council.

91
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And the Fel Council is some familiar faces

92
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
that you might recognize from Diablo II.

93
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
These were priests of the Zacarum,

94
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
holy men who were corrupted and basically became vessels of hatred

95
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
in their own right.

96
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The council members in Diablo II tried to help contain Mephisto

97
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
in his soul stone.

98
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And of course, Mephisto being Mephisto,

99
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
slowly but surely corrupted them.

100
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
And eventually they had soul stones pierced into their hands

101
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
and became super powerful.

102
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But eventually you overcame them and sent them to Hell.

103
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Through the course of the story, resummon them.

104
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They've been reborn, slightly new powers,

105
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
but the same animosity toward you.

106
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
What's interesting about this boss encounter

107
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
is there are five council members,

108
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
but you're only going to fight three of them at once.

109
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
This allows us to then create many different flavors

110
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
of the boss fight for the Fel Council.

111
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
In fact, it's about 10 variations in all.

112
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And so every time you go into that council fight,

113
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
there's a very good chance you're going to have a different fight

114
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
than the last time you played it.

115
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
We think it's going to offer a lot of replay for players.

116
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What we also introduced during these waves

117
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
are opportunities for you to earn ether.

118
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Burning ether is the resource

119
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
that you gather during the Infernal Hordes

120
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
that you can then spend at the end of the activity.

121
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
There's going to be a fixed number of waves

122
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
that you have to defeat.

123
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And once you've completed all those waves,

124
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
then you'll face the Fel Council,

125
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
defeat them, and collect your treasure.

126
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So upon defeating the Fel Council,

127
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the spoils of Hell will spawn.

128
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And then you consume your burning ether

129
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and opening those chests.

130
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Now, the trick is when you are playing through these waves,

131
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
that's your opportunity to earn as much ether as you can.

132
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Different events are going to spawn all throughout the waves

133
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
around the periphery of the arena.

134
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And it's your job to try and defeat

135
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
as many of those events as possible

136
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
to try and gather up all the ether you can.

137
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Really skilled players are going to be able

138
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
to really maximize that ether

139
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
so they get the biggest payout possible

140
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
at the end after defeating the Fel Council.

141
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So with this burning ether,

142
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
you'll be able to get new uniques,

143
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
you'll be able to get new legendaries,

144
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
you'll be able to get rare materials,

145
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
things you might have scoured the whole of Sanctuary for

146
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
in previous seasons or in the base game.

147
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But now we offer it to you here,

148
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
down in the depths of Hell.

149
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
A lot of these new uniques and legendaries

150
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
really build on top of this idea

151
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
that they've been forged in Hell.

152
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And so they're going to have unique looks

153
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
that you can then make into cosmetics

154
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
to apply wherever you like.

155
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
They can also have unique VFX and sound effects

156
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
to really create the sense

157
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
that they were forged in Hell.

158
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
One particular one that I enjoy using a lot

159
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
are boots.

160
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Boots, you say?

161
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Well, these boots not only have been forged in Hell,

162
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
whenever you use a power with a cooldown,

163
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
they shoot out a ring of fire

164
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
that hits everyone around you.

165
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
That's just one sample of the types of powers

166
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
that we're exploring.

167
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So death in the Infernal Hordes

168
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
is quite a big deal.

169
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You're returning to the Realm of Hatred

170
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
where Mephisto was born.

171
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Like, this has to be a big deal.

172
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
In the Infernal Hordes,

173
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
it's a lot like Nightmare Dungeons.

174
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You only get a fixed number of revives

175
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
in order to be able to get to the end of your run.

176
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So at lower difficulties in the Infernal Hordes,

177
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
you'll get a number of revives

178
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
shared between your party.

179
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But at higher difficulty levels,

180
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
the game is going to start taking away those revives.

181
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And that increases the stakes that you have.

182
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
If you die too much,

183
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
you'll be ejected from the mode.

184
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
In the Infernal Hordes,

185
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
we've created a lot of new ways

186
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
for monsters to ambush the players.

187
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And so I'm pretty stoked to see

188
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
how our players respond to these.

189
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The seasonal quest line

190
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and the eternal quest line,

191
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
they have lots of little surprises

192
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and twists and turns in them.

193
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And there's even some surprises

194
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
we've buried deep within the Infernal Hordes

195
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
that hopefully players will have a great time with.

196
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
every member or other ones

197
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
callers play on board some of our favorite

198
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Dev a hard work plan

199
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
of creating besides problems.

200
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
We want to give up this fashion...

201
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Adam and Adam...

202
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Welcome to the stream.

203
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah,

204
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
we did it.

205
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We took it over.

206
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We took it over.

207
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's just Adam and Adam show.

208
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Now I don't even have to host.

209
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
It feels great.

210
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yeah.

211
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And for everyone curious in chat, Adam is not going anywhere.

212
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
As you all know, there's a ton going on in Diablo.

213
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah, Adam Fletcher isn't going anywhere.

214
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
This one, yes.

215
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Adam Jackson.

216
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I deal with this one.

217
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
There's a ton going on in Diablo right now.

218
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We've had a ton of live streams.

219
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
There's been so much going on, so it's just a lot easier to share the load amongst all

220
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
the hosting live streams.

221
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
We just finished the Spirit Born live stream, so it's been a little crazy.

222
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And Marcus is here to help out.

223
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So you guys may see Marcus more here hosting some live streams in the future.

224
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
But yeah, I'm not disappearing.

225
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Today, you're acting as Colin today.

226
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Exactly.

227
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Today, I get to pretend I'm Colin.

228
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Ooh.

229
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah.

230
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm pretty excited about that.

231
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Some big shoes to fill there.

232
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
So yeah.

233
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
That is absolutely true.

234
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
In terms of everything that's been going on in Diablo, we just had our Season of the

235
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Infernal Hordes PTR.

236
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And we've got a lot of learnings.

237
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah.

238
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But we also do have one additional person.

239
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Of course we do.

240
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Mr. Dan Tanguay from Albany, New York.

241
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Dan, welcome to the stream.

242
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Hey.

243
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
How's everyone doing?

244
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Doing great.

245
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Good to see you.

246
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
See, Dan's in the Cathedral of Light.

247
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
We're in the Burning Hell.

248
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah.

249
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah.

250
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's perfect.

251
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's hot over here.

252
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Exactly.

253
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It tracks.

254
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah.

255
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah.

256
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Thanks for joining us today, Dan.

257
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And the Season 5 PTR.

258
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah.

259
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We've got a lot of learnings.

260
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
This was our second PTR for Diablo 4.

261
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So we have a ton of feedback to get into, but we also have some notes from the community

262
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
on the PTR overall and some learning.

263
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So Adam, do you want to walk us through that?

264
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah.

265
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Most definitely.

266
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You know, this is now our second PTR that we had.

267
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We had one for Season 4 and of course one now for Season 5.

268
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And, you know, we've learned a lot from these PTRs.

269
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
PTRs are incredibly important.

270
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
They're huge.

271
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
They're really beneficial for the whole entire team here.

272
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And one thing we heard a lot of feedback, at least from the Season 5 PTR, is obviously

273
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
as you're playing through a PTR, it's a non-final thing that you're playing.

274
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's still very early on.

275
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
There are going to be more bugs, more issues just present in the PTR because we are getting

276
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
something out there a little bit earlier just so we can get feedback in on it.

277
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But one thing that I think we most definitely heard from the community is, hey, the tools

278
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
within PTR at times haven't been the best or the most efficient for players that need

279
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
to actually test the content that we actually do have.

280
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And so one thing that we did want to at least address and highlight and acknowledge is that,

281
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you know, we do plan on making the PTR experiences better in the future.

282
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We do plan on equipping more tools for players out there so they're not having to sit there

283
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and grind out, you know, maybe like all the new legendaries or uniques or something like

284
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,000
it.

285
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Especially in like Season 5, for example.

286
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We gave a character copy feature in this one.

287
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And then, of course, we had the boost feature which came back from Season 4.

288
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And when you boosted your character, a new character, you would end up getting some of

289
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
the new legendaries or uniques within Season 5.

290
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
What happened, though, is that it wasn't all of them.

291
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And then we had players within Season 5 having to actually go out and spend their time that

292
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
they probably could be testing other things, like trying to find those items.

293
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And obviously that's like not the most efficient thing to do.

294
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So we do want to, we hear everyone, we acknowledge it, we do want to make the PTR experience better.

295
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So I will say that like in future PTRs, and you'll see this gradually over the next couple

296
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
PTRs, it won't be all of a sudden, like things will be completely different.

297
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But I do expect like, and players should expect like, that we will have better tools for them

298
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
to properly test as we gradually go through PTRs in the future.

299
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And we appreciate everyone like letting us know, like, we most definitely hear you guys.

300
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And we most definitely want to make that experience better from that.

301
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But PTRs have been great.

302
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Huge thanks to everyone for jumping in and checking it out for sure.

303
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, that feedback is so important.

304
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So, you know, increasing how great these PTRs are is really, really important.

305
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And I know for the Season 5 PTR, one of the huge features that we had in there was the Infernal Hordes itself.

306
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So for everyone who didn't get a chance to jump into the PTR, Mr. Dan Tanguay, can you kind of walk us through

307
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
what the Infernal Hordes is and what players can expect?

308
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah, absolutely. I'll give you all a quick recap.

309
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So, the Infernal Hordes is a wave-based activity with push-your-luck choices in between each of those waves.

310
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So, imagine waves of monsters coming in, lots and lots of monsters, in fact.

311
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And you also have some events, many events that you can also participate in.

312
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Now, in between those waves, you're going to be making what's called the Infernal Offer.

313
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And you're going to pick a boon or a bane, and that's going to change your gameplay for the rest of the run.

314
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So, it allows you to customize what your Infernal run is going to be like.

315
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And so, we probably see right here, yep, we've got an Infernal Offer that comes up.

316
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So, you're going to select one of those, and that will then change, of course, the rest of the run.

317
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Now, when you complete the required number of waves, then you're able to go confront the Fell Council, who you can see here.

318
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And the Fell Council, as you saw from the video that just came on right before this livestream, are former servants, well, actually current servants of Mephisto, that you defeated in Diablo II, and have now returned.

319
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And you must fight them once more.

320
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And once you beat them, you're going to be able to spawn what's called the Spoils of Hell.

321
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And these are chests that contain a lot of great goodies.

322
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And so, with that Burning Aether you've been collecting all through the course of the mode, you're able to choose what kind of Spoils you want.

323
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You've got Spoils of Legendaries and Uniques, and there's some absolutely great new Uniques and Legendaries in Season 5, and you can probably farm about half of them, over half of them, from the Infernal Horts.

324
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You're also able to spawn Spoils of Materials and buy into that, and that will get you Gem Shards, that will get you Angel's Breath, and of course that will get you Master Working Materials, which you absolutely need to complete your items journey.

325
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You can also cash out and get a bunch of gold, which, you know, for those folks who are re-rolling their items in order to Master Work them or to enchant their items, is going to be hugely beneficial.

326
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And then finally, there's a special bonus chest at higher tiers where you can get a guaranteed roll on a greater FX item.

327
00:36:47,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And so, since that's one of the main chases in the, you know, the final steps of the endgame, you know, we wanted to make sure there was an opportunity for players to really, you know, get a little more lucky with it.

328
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So, final thoughts on the Infernal Hordes.

329
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Remember that it unlocks at World Tier 3.

330
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You need an Infernal Compass in order to unlock it.

331
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And there's eight levels of difficulty for it.

332
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And so, yeah, that's a quick recap.

333
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Awesome.

334
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Thanks for walking us through, Dan.

335
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Super excited to jump in and try to grab some of those uniques.

336
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Now, I know, considering the Infernal Hordes was such a big part of PTR, we did have a lot of community feedback with regards to, you know, getting into the mode, you know, some of the pacing.

337
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So, can you walk us through some of those learnings we had based off the PTR feedback?

338
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Oh, absolutely.

339
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So, there was a lot of feedback that came in.

340
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And so much so that we weren't able to address it all.

341
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But we did distill down some big trends and feedback that we were able to tackle.

342
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And so, the first off is that we wanted to improve access to the Infernal Hordes.

343
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So, yeah, it was just too hard to get into the mode regularly to test it.

344
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And folks who wanted to get into it very quickly couldn't get into it either.

345
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So, we've pretty much overhauled access to the Infernal Hordes at this point.

346
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Compasses still exist, but the drop rates on those have been boosted quite a bit.

347
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You know, we want you to earn around four or five compasses an hour so that you can do about four or five runs per hour.

348
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So, you know, you've got, you know, 50% chance to get them from item chests and Helltides unless it's one of those item chests that costs, you know, 250 senders, in which case that's 100% chance.

349
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I mean, you put in the time, we'll just give it to you.

350
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And then, you know, Nightmare Dungeon and Whispers, there's about a 75% chance to get one from a dungeon complete there.

351
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You know, compass tiers at really high levels.

352
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
We wanted to make sure drop naturally from high-tiered activities like Nightmare Dungeons and the Pit.

353
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And we've also given you a path to just crafting these outright with the Occultus with Sigil Power and Forgotten Souls.

354
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And then finally, you know, it was a bug that the first compass that dropped from the Eternal Quest was actually a World Tier 3.

355
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And if you were playing World Tier 4, you had to switch back to actually get in the Infernal Hordes, and that didn't feel great.

356
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So we updated that as well.

357
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Moving along, the next big thing that we focused on was combat.

358
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
The pacing of combat wasn't hitting our goals.

359
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And, you know, we had done a lot of internal testing on it.

360
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
And, you know, folks who weren't as in-game focused gave us a lot of feedback where, you know, oh, this is super intense.

361
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Could we dial it back a little bit?

362
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So we did.

363
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
But then we put it out on PTR and clearly all said, hey, no, we want more.

364
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So we're giving you more.

365
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The first thing that we did, though, is we fixed some bugs that actually had a really big impact on the experience.

366
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
There was a boss health bug.

367
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Man, that is hard to say.

368
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Boss health bug.

369
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That caused all the bosses to be super tanky.

370
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And at Tier 8, there were some folks who were spending almost an hour's worth of time in the Infernal's Horde.

371
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And that just, that's not what we wanted.

372
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So we fixed those bugs and retuned everything.

373
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So, you know, it's a much tighter experience at this point.

374
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Similarly, there was a bug where difficulty wasn't scaling appropriate in multiplayer.

375
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So we fixed that.

376
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And then some tuning things.

377
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So the pace of many events are pretty much rapid fire at high tiers now, you know.

378
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And so you're going to be spinning a lot of plates in this mode.

379
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
The monster spawn rates have also been increased to, you know, really capture that feeling of being overwhelmed.

380
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And then finally, we reduced the wave timer down to 60 seconds, which, you know, just creates a much punchier experience for players.

381
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And, of course, retuned everything.

382
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And then on top of that, we said, you know what, let's just make it easier for players to pick up Burning Aether to increase that pace.

383
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So the pets now pick up the Burning Aether as well.

384
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And that's not all.

385
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Now, of course, you know, we're all playing this for the rewards, right?

386
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And so it was really important for us to improve rewards across the board.

387
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You spend time with the mode, you want to be rewarded appropriately.

388
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And we weren't hitting that mark in the PTR.

389
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So we raised the minimum amount of Burning Aether earned from any single run.

390
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
First off, every single source of Aether got boosted by one Aether.

391
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And then we added Aether drops to the Fel Council so that you're also getting, you know, a lot of bang for your buck just by defeating the boss as well.

392
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And that actually scales per tier as well.

393
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Next up, we retuned all the costs of the Spoils of Hell.

394
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So, you know, the greater equipment, that one with the greater affects in it, used to cost 250.

395
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Now it only costs 60.

396
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Similarly, we retuned the Spoils of Equipment and the Spoils of Materials.

397
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So now they only cost 20 Aether apiece.

398
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And then finally, we retuned all the rewards that were inside, you know, the chest as well.

399
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So, you know, at your bare minimum level, when you first start playing the Infernal Hordes and you're not sure exactly how it works,

400
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
we still want you to feel rewarded just for the time that you invested.

401
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And so the rewards at that bare minimum feel pretty good now.

402
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
But, you know, if you are spending a lot of time with it and you know how to optimize this mode,

403
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
we wanted to make sure that, you know, the rewards reflected that too.

404
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So that higher, you know, ceiling of rewards has been raised as well.

405
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So you're playing at tier 8, you are going to get significantly more rewards than you would at tier 1.

406
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Awesome.

407
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, that's quite a bit.

408
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
That's a lot of stuff to change.

409
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I just want to call out.

410
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Dan, your shirt is amazing.

411
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I was going to interrupt, but I didn't want to.

412
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I was talking.

413
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Now I just want that shirt.

414
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And I'm very jealous that I don't actually own that shirt.

415
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So I will message you after the stream to let me know where I can get this shirt.

416
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, I think someone on the team made it.

417
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So I was like, yeah, I needed a new shirt for the live stream.

418
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That is her art, 100%.

419
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Yes.

420
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Now we know.

421
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Now I know.

422
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And it is totally awesome.

423
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I had to wear it.

424
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So it is Aaron.

425
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I totally know.

426
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Aaron, we will be touching base after the stream.

427
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yes.

428
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yeah, Dan, that's a ton of changes.

429
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It sounds like we're really cranking up the intensity for the Infernal Hordes.

430
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Really, really cool to see.

431
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Super excited to jump into it.

432
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So I know for the Infernal Hordes, that's one part of the season that's coming.

433
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But there was a lot that players didn't get to experience in the PTR that will be coming with the season.

434
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So can you kind of share what's going to be new for players coming into Season 5?

435
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Yeah, absolutely.

436
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So the PTR was really focused on features that were on both the Eternal Realm and the Seasonal Realm.

437
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And we have a number of Seasonal exclusive features that you all haven't had a chance to play with yet.

438
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So we're going to tell you about them now.

439
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
First up, we've got the Seasonal Progression.

440
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So you're going to see what we call the Reputation System in some footage here in just a second.

441
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And the Reputation System is something that we had in Season 4 and actually earlier in some events.

442
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And we've brought it back here because it serves as a great backbone for the season.

443
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And we've evolved it in some significant ways.

444
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So first off, how you earn reputation is a bit different now.

445
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,000
But it was really important for us in Season 5 to give you more choice in how you wanted to earn your reputation.

446
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So previously in Season 4, you earned reputation through just playing Helltides, as you should,

447
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
because we made a lot of improvements to Helltides in Season 4.

448
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But here, we wanted to broaden it out a bit more.

449
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So you earn reputation in Season 5 by just defeating powerful servants of Hell.

450
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Elites, Hellborn, champions, bosses, so on and so forth, right?

451
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And so that gives you a lot more choice to say,

452
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Hey, you know, I can earn reputation in Helltides, or I want to earn it in the Infernal Hordes.

453
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Or honestly, I want to take a break and do a stronghold.

454
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You'll get reputation there too.

455
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Another small tweak that we made that's pretty important is that when you pick up reputation,

456
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
you actually get a small boost in XP as well.

457
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So as you're continually filling out your reputation track,

458
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
you're starting to level up just a little more quickly than you did before.

459
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Now, another thing that you might have seen are these big green tiles in the reputation system.

460
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And those are seasonal quests.

461
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So we made it very clear that hitting certain tiers of your reputation system now unlock the seasonal quests.

462
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And it actually starts to weave the narrative through the progression a bit more,

463
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
which we really like the feel of and we hope to build on in the future.

464
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And then finally, you know, again, it's all about the rewards, right?

465
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So there's lots of great returning rewards in the reputation system.

466
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You're going to be able to earn uniques, specifically class-based uniques.

467
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
They're going to help you figure out what you want your build to be early on in the season.

468
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You're also going to be able to get other powerful equipment, big drops of crafting materials.

469
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And of course, at the very end of the reputation track will be a resplendent spark

470
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
that you can use to ultimately craft a mythic unique.

471
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Next up, we've got the seasonal quest line.

472
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You know, I was teasing it up a little bit with the reputation system there.

473
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So the season of the Infernal Hordes has a rather unique narrative flow

474
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
because we have an eternal quest line that introduces, you know,

475
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
a big new feature that takes you back to hell, right?

476
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And so we wanted to make sure that was available to everybody, not just seasonal players.

477
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And that also starts at World Tier 3.

478
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Now, those of you who played the PTR have already seen it.

479
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That's the one that features Locrin helping you to get back to hell

480
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
and confront the Infernal Hordes.

481
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But we've developed an additional secondary, well, not really secondary,

482
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
an additional seasonal quest line named of Lambs and Wolves,

483
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
which we're kind of teasing right here.

484
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And new NPC named Estelle is guiding you to become more powerful

485
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
before you join Locrin to journey back to hell.

486
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Now, this one's going to be a little closer in tone to the Iron Wolves quest in Season 4,

487
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
but it's going to be a bit more expansive than that.

488
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And like I said, it weaves in and out of the seasonal progression.

489
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So how do they relate to one another?

490
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Well, the seasonal quest line is exclusive to Season 5.

491
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And so you are able to get a really more complete picture of the story

492
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
by playing both the seasonal quest line and the eternal quest line.

493
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You can kind of think of the seasonal quest line as almost like a prequel

494
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
to you unlocking the Infernal Hordes.

495
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But we also wanted to make sure that our eternal players don't get left out.

496
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
This is an eternal mode that we're introducing, after all, with the infernal hordes.

497
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And so, you know, the infernal, or rather the eternal quest line here,

498
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
which is named Eyes of the Enemy,

499
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
is going to be available for all players and won't go away after the season end.

500
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So it's going to be there forever.

501
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So if you decide sometime down the road that you want to check out the infernal hordes

502
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and say, I don't know, Season 6, you can do that, right?

503
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And so, yeah, that's where we ended up with the quest lines this season.

504
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And then the final thing I want to introduce are the Hellbreach dungeons,

505
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
which we've gotten a few teases of before, but we can go into more detail here.

506
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So these are all new micro dungeons to show that Hell has started taking root in Sanctuary.

507
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Now, since the Infernal Hordes is an endgame activity, World Tier 3+,

508
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
we wanted to make sure we had some content that targeted our World Tier 1 and 2 players.

509
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And so you go into these, it's going to be a great source of reputation.

510
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's going to be a great place to get some powerful items.

511
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And it's a pretty cool place to just kind of experience what the gameplay is going to be like down the road.

512
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Now, originally we had kind of patterned these off the Donheim tunnels, you know, if you all remember those.

513
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
But, you know, with the introduction of Helltide in Season 4, we had to change it up a little bit

514
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
because I don't think that alone would have sufficed.

515
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And so what we did is we pulled in a lot of elements from the Infernal Hordes,

516
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
and we're using this as an opportunity to introduce those elements.

517
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So you see right here, we've got a simple Infernal Choice that shows, you know,

518
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
that basically says, okay, do I want my boss to be a little simpler or a little more difficult?

519
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And you get to choose.

520
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Hopefully the person playing chose the more difficult one I didn't see.

521
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But you're going to be rewarded a lot more for taking that risk of making the boss more difficult.

522
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And you're going to be earning Burning Aether.

523
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And at the end, there are going to be some spoils that you can spend on.

524
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And like I said, you'll get some really powerful gear that should help you on your journey toward encountering the Infernal Hordes.

525
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So if you want more details on these, I recommend that you check out our blog that came out two days ago.

526
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And yeah, thank you.

527
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Dan, that's awesome.

528
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I got to say, chat got pretty excited when you mentioned Domain Tunnels.

529
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,000
They kind of blew up there.

530
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So definitely a fan favorite.

531
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Everyone remembers the Dopamine Tunnels.

532
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah.

533
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Right, right.

534
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And it's great that there's now like opportunities for players within like World Tier 1 and 2

535
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
to actually be able to have other options of leveling up.

536
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
And with these new help reaches, it's...

537
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah, it's a good way for people to tease in the new content.

538
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Exactly.

539
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Yeah.

540
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Then you get into those Infernal Hordes in World Tier 3 and off.

541
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Away you go.

542
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yeah.

543
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah, that's awesome.

544
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Dan, thanks so much for joining us.

545
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
As Dan had mentioned, we did publish the Season of the Infernal Hordes blog a little bit earlier this week.

546
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We are going to have patch notes that we'll publish following the stream.

547
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So for any details we reveal across the stream, you can check those out for more information.

548
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Dan's going to join us towards the end of the stream for our Q&A.

549
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So if you have any questions, please drop those in Twitch chat and we'll be pulling them to get into those towards the end of the stream.

550
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So we just touched on a ton of stuff that's coming in Season of the Infernal Hordes itself.

551
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
But based off the PTR, we also have a ton of changes coming across Sanctuary.

552
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And to walk us through from the other end of the stream, Mr. Adam Fletcher.

553
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I get to pretend like I'm the person on the panel.

554
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I'm going to pull out my...

555
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You designed and did all of this?

556
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah, exactly.

557
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Put in all the changes.

558
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
We have a fantastic design team here.

559
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And I am going to bring in my inner Colin Feiner to talk about some stuff.

560
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But yes, as Marcus mentioned, there's a lot of changes.

561
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
A lot of the stuff that we actually did talk about in the blog and some of the stuff that people heard from PTR.

562
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
But there have been changes even since PTR.

563
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And we have a few new things in here that we'll also squeak in here as we're talking about it.

564
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But one big topic I know that everyone brought up after PTR and that we even brought up even during our PTR stream was Helltide specifically.

565
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
One big topic within Helltide was Baneful Hearts.

566
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:25,000
If you guys remember back during the PTR stream, we talked about how Season 4, everyone had a plethora of Baneful Hearts.

567
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I mean, it felt like everyone was always carrying about 100 to 150 at any given time.

568
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And you could deposit as many into your heart's desire and still always have that same amount.

569
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
We wanted Baneful Hearts to feel a little bit more special.

570
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And so during the PTR, we actually did take the number down in terms of how many you would be able to earn.

571
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We did hear everyone's feedback.

572
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
People were like, that feels kind of crappy.

573
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So we most definitely readjusted the drop rate of Baneful Hearts to really kind of close that gap in between Season 4 and Season 5 PTR.

574
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
We wanted to make sure that was, you know, it feels better.

575
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Like, you won't have 150 on you at all times most likely, but you still have plenty now to be able to summon the Maiden as well.

576
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So some of the changes that we have coming up for Baneful Hearts and the rates that will help with this

577
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
is we're bumping up the drop rates off of chests within Helltide specifically.

578
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Players will also be able to get a guaranteed heart drop off of Helltide Commanders now.

579
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And then one big thing is within world bosses, yeah, we actually have an image of, like,

580
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
where you'll be able to now get your heart drop rates guaranteed, is world bosses.

581
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Sometimes world bosses actually do spawn within a Helltide zone.

582
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And we thought it would be kind of cool that, you know, hey, you killed the world boss there

583
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
and a Helltide happened to be present in that specific zone where the world boss is.

584
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Now you'll just get a guaranteed three within that world boss kill, which is kind of nice.

585
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,000
That's super cool.

586
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
We're also bumping up the drop chance to, like, local events, mastery chests within Helltide,

587
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
and, of course, harbingers within it as well.

588
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And then one big change that we're doing within this as well is the blood maiden within world tier 1 and 2

589
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
in season 4 and even season 5 PTR, you would have to deposit three hearts,

590
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
just like world tier 3 and world tier 4.

591
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We're actually tweaking that down to just 2 for world tier 1 and 2.

592
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So there'll be one less, like, altar pedestal for you to deposit a heart for

593
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
to summon the blood maiden within world tier 1 and 2, which should help out with, you know.

594
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
It just makes your farming a little bit quicker in the early levels.

595
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Exactly.

596
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Exactly.

597
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And it doesn't feel like you're needing to put in that many for those earlier levels.

598
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
That much easier to chain a ton of blood maidens back to back to back.

599
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Exactly.

600
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah.

601
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So next thing we did want to talk about is within Helltides as tortured gifts,

602
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
another change for world tier 1 and 2.

603
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
There'll be less cinders required to open up the tortured gift chest within world tier 1 and 2,

604
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
so it's dropping from 100 to 75 specifically.

605
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And then this is something we talked about in the last stream

606
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
where it was, like, really difficult for players to actually kind of go through a Helltide

607
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
and complete, you know, a full-on, like, you know,

608
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Tree of Whispers, like, progression line within Helltide.

609
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So now you'll actually be able to earn all 10 Grim Favors within a Helltide for sure

610
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
when it's in one subzone and actually deposit that within the Tree of Whispers

611
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and get the Whisper cash out of it.

612
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I know sometimes it would take, like, sometimes two Helltides to actually do it,

613
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
or you would have to leave the Helltide and go to a non-Helltide zone

614
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
to kind of finish it off and stuff.

615
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And so we wanted to make sure that was more efficient specifically within Helltides.

616
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And then this was a big thing.

617
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Big one.

618
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
So, you know, we talked about during the Season 5 PTR stream

619
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
that Profane Mindcages were a Season 4 mechanic.

620
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It was only within that.

621
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Well, they were, technically.

622
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Yeah. And so it was removed from Season 5.

623
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Heard the feedback.

624
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And people were like,

625
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
wow, we really missed Mindcages.

626
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Bring them back.

627
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
What's going on?

628
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So we did bring them back.

629
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And we brought them back in, like, a cooler form.

630
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So now you can actually stack up.

631
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So, one, Profane Mindcages are coming back for Season 5.

632
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You can actually stack these now up to 3x in Season 5.

633
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
This is Season 5 only.

634
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So this is only on the Seasonal Realm specifically.

635
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
But now stacking up to 3x does actually boost up Monster levels.

636
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Better rewards.

637
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Better energy.

638
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Pretty significant.

639
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Better huge.

640
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Yeah.

641
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So you'll end up, you could knock Monster levels up, you know, 30 levels if you wanted to.

642
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And you will benefit or maybe suffer.

643
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Or suffer quite a lot, yeah.

644
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
But it does give players the option now to use that.

645
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And so Profane Mindcages are back and in a kind of a cooler form for Season 5.

646
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Which is really cool.

647
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And we really appreciate the feedback we heard from players regarding Helltides on that.

648
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Next, overall, just general game updates that we do have.

649
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
One big thing that we're doing is we are boosting Legendary drop rates off of really pretty much almost like all most content.

650
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Like Helltides, Nightmare Dungeons, Infernal Hordes.

651
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
For any monster that is level 100 or higher.

652
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So you'll be able to see and just obtain more Legendaries that way.

653
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Less rares, things like that.

654
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Separately, Enchanting.

655
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
One big thing we heard is, you know, people were somewhat, you know, blocked a little bit with Angel's Breath.

656
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And so we did remove Angel's Breath as a cost towards Enchanting.

657
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's no longer required.

658
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
We've actually now kind of just swapped this over to the respective Legendary salvage.

659
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So, for instance, Armour, it would be Coiling Wards, Weapons, Baleful Fragments, and then Jewelry, Abstruse Sigils.

660
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Tongue twister there.

661
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Abstruse Sigils.

662
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Abstruse Sigils.

663
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
But you now have the ability of being able to do Enchanting.

664
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Just note that, of course, gold costs are still associated with Enchanting.

665
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But now it's a little bit, removing a little bit of that friction with the Angel's Breath requirement.

666
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
And then this is something that we had talked about beforehand, which is just crowd control.

667
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Overall, within Season 5, it's going to be a lot better.

668
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I know crowd control can be sometimes painful or either knock down.

669
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Yeah, knock down and frozen for a million years and crying and then dying horribly.

670
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And so CC duration has been essentially just pretty much reduced across the board to 1.5 seconds max.

671
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And then one cool feature is you can also spam potions now while you're CC'd.

672
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Really good for people in hardcore or maybe it creates more desperate moments of like, I'm still dying.

673
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
No matter what.

674
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
But you now have the ability of being able to spam potions specifically if you are CC'd, which is really nice.

675
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Yeah.

676
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You know, we were talking about like charging like...

677
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Bloated Corpse Fiends when they like all stun you and they do the Poisoning AOE.

678
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Exactly.

679
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
As a keyboard slammer myself, thank you for...

680
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yes, exactly.

681
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,000
...for this change.

682
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Next update we have is World Bosses.

683
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So funny enough, this actually fell into Season 5 PTR, but that we forgot to actually put it in Season 5 PTR notes.

684
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And we actually forgot to actually mention it.

685
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
We got a lot of reports of people going like, hey, why are World Bosses like tankier and harder to kill?

686
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
They actually fight back now.

687
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Wait, what?

688
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I'm not used to this.

689
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Yeah, it's like, what's going on?

690
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So they actually had a feature called Resilience on there.

691
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Essentially, Resilience normalizes damage across like all World content.

692
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
So it's like if you...

693
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Shared World content.

694
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So like if a bunch of people are all coming into a World Boss, you should expect to find that the World Bosses will be a little bit more tankier,

695
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
a little bit longer in terms of the experience that you're having as you're fighting against them.

696
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And less, you know, like, hey, I blinked and it's gone.

697
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Oh, sweet.

698
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
The boss was here for three seconds.

699
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Nice.

700
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah, exactly.

701
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Three.

702
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Mine, they barely even spawn in.

703
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It was actually present in PTR.

704
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And we actually got a lot of people that were going like, hey, I think this is a bug.

705
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And it actually wasn't a bug.

706
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It was just something we forgot to actually mention in the patch notes.

707
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So that is our bad.

708
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But we do want to make sure that everyone's aware that World Bosses now have a feature called Resilience.

709
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
And that will end up helping out with those encounters specifically.

710
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Separately for bosses, Pit Boss damage has been reduced pretty much across the board.

711
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And then one big thing that we did want to call out is we got a lot of feedback within, you know, Season 4 and, of course, the PTR for Season 5.

712
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
We saw some people address the changes that we were having there.

713
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But Pit Bosses had this tendency within Season 4 to have, like, very sharp damage.

714
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Yeah.

715
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Where it would scale up really hard.

716
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And there were times where you would run into a specific Pit Boss.

717
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And you could potentially just get one shot based off of, like, those.

718
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
The shadow boss, like, that would appear.

719
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,000
The extra one's coming.

720
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
It would just come, one shot you, and laugh as they left and you died.

721
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Yeah.

722
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So now there is a feature within Season 5 where those Shadow Pit Boss, like, affixes will appear.

723
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And they'll actually leave kind of a stacking debuff onto players now.

724
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So, and it can go up to three times.

725
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And then, obviously, when it gets to the max, you have a very good chance of getting, like, heavily, like, punished for taking up to three debuffs from that end.

726
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:33,000
And this is really to allow a little bit more flexibility for players, you know, based off of the feedback we heard regarding a lot of the one shots and things like that.

727
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah.

728
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You now have the ability of being able to, you know, take a couple of these debuffs and maybe not, like, completely get punished from that.

729
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:49,000
It's less about, like, the perfection kind of involved, but more so being a little bit more forgiving in some of those opportunities.

730
01:01:49,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Now, if you are a person that just, like, face tanks things and goes in and immediately takes three debuffs, you're probably still gonna learn that, you know, that damage is still gonna be very sharp with the three debuffs.

731
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So, but it is something to help out in regards to that.

732
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah, to be clear how that debuff works is every time that you get hit with one of those shadow boss mechanics, you'll take the debuff and it increases all of your damage taken.

733
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So, the regular boss is gonna hit you harder and the shadow bosses are gonna hit you harder, too.

734
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Exactly.

735
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
So, you know, you just don't want that to ramp up too much because then everything is gonna be more punishing.

736
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Yeah, exactly.

737
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
There's a few people already asking about those debuffs in chat, so.

738
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah, it just increases all your damage taken.

739
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So, basically, you know, you get some freebies of getting hit by them.

740
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You really don't want to, but then after that, you gotta watch out because then it's about as hard as Season 4 was.

741
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Exactly.

742
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So, and then another big thing.

743
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:46,000
So, this was something that was actually not present in the PTR, but it's something that we've heard a lot of feedback about and actually a ton of feedback about.

744
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And this is group play in pits.

745
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:57,000
In Season 4, the way that it worked was if you were in the pit and you were the party leader and you had three friends that joined along,

746
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:05,000
you would essentially get through the pit, you would get all the master working materials for yourself, 100% of them,

747
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
and then everyone else that joined you would only get about, like, 50%.

748
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And it felt pretty punishing for people to really kind of join up with friends and run through pits.

749
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:24,000
And we heard a lot of feedback of, like, hey, it'd be great if, like, if I'm just joining my friend, we can all just get, you know, 100% of the pit material rewards.

750
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And so, that is being tweaked for Season 5.

751
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Now, the whole entire party itself will end up receiving 100% of the materials that you end up receiving at the end of the pit.

752
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
But, yeah, so we appreciate the feedback.

753
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Thank you guys for letting us know.

754
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And this is something that wasn't in PTR but will be for Season 5.

755
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Next up, we have Endgame Bosses.

756
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So, this is something, of course, we talked about during the PTR.

757
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And we do want to highlight again because I think this is amazing and will save a whole lot of time.

758
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
So nice.

759
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
You can now resummon Endgame Bosses immediately after you end up killing them.

760
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,000
So, as you're going through the different boss ladders and stuff, you can just reset and the altar will reappear, as you can see in the footage.

761
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And throw in the mats and, bam, again, you're fighting Durial, which is really nice.

762
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
No more exiting the dungeon, resetting the dungeon, running back, and then having to do it over again.

763
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
This should save up a whole lot of time.

764
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
This should help a whole lot with farming as well, specifically for gear.

765
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And you'll be hearing a lot about all this new gear from Adam here in a second.

766
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But there were some additional changes as well to some of the Endgame Bosses that we do have.

767
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Like, for instance, the first one we're going to talk about is the Beast and Ice.

768
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
The Beast and Ice, of course, required a sigil to actually summon.

769
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Or to actually create the dungeon to go in to fight the Beast and Ice.

770
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
There's no longer a sigil that will be required.

771
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And also, the Beast and Ice is now way closer to the dungeon.

772
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It's going to be a short dungeon crawl similar to the other Endgame Bosses.

773
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
So you're not having to, you know, go through a lengthy dungeon just for that.

774
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Yeah, a whole dungeon just to get to the boss.

775
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Yeah.

776
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Likewise, no more sigil dust will be required for summoning the Beast and Ice.

777
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And then, of course, we thought about internal players in this situation.

778
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Because some of them have actually crafted a bunch of sigils.

779
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
And now, since sigils are no longer required,

780
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
you can still use those leftover sigils to immediately resummon the Beast and Ice

781
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
without needing the mats that are still required for the Beast and Ice.

782
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
So it's kind of a nice benefit to them.

783
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And then, of course, Varshan also got some updates.

784
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Varshan required a bunch of different body parts.

785
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And now, Varshan just requires malignant hearts.

786
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
And, of course, we thought about internal players in this specific instance.

787
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Eternal players can convert their old body parts to hearts

788
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
by going to the Alchemist.

789
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
That's a magical Alchemist.

790
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Like, yeah.

791
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Wow.

792
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
But if you ever need a spare heart, you just go to an Alchemist.

793
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That's just how it works.

794
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Just swap it out.

795
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Yeah, that's just how it works.

796
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
But, yeah, some changes coming to that.

797
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And then, separately, endgame bosses.

798
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
For endgame bosses, the Boss Ladder bosses,

799
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
they won't be dropping rare items anymore.

800
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
They're actually just going to drop additional gold.

801
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And, of course, you'll have your opportunity of getting legendaries

802
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
and uniques and mythic uniques from them.

803
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
But now we just remove the rare item drops from them.

804
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So it takes up, like, less of the drop chances that you could get

805
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
in terms of their specific tables.

806
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And then on tormented bosses,

807
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
tormented bosses now drop five times as many boss mats as before.

808
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And, of course, all tormented bosses have a better chance

809
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
of dropping a mythic unique.

810
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
So we are boosting up the mythic unique drop.

811
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
There's actually specifics on all this stuff in the patch notes

812
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
that people can read afterwards.

813
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And we've also reduced the Stygian stone cost

814
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
for the tormented bosses.

815
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Before it was two, and now it's dropping to one.

816
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So it should help out with players wanting to experiment

817
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
or try out some of the more difficult endgame bosses

818
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
that are available, which are their tormented versions.

819
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
And then one big thing that is happening,

820
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
and this is something that was kind of mentioned in the blog,

821
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
and people will see more specifics in the patch notes.

822
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Experience is changing in terms of, like, the XP bonus

823
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
from killing higher-level monsters.

824
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It's no longer capped in, I believe it's now...

825
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Well, it's...

826
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I think it used to be 10 levels higher.

827
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
You didn't get more?

828
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It's so capped, shall I say.

829
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
It's capped to 30 levels.

830
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
That's actually incorrect on the slide.

831
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
But it used to be 10 levels.

832
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
It's now 30 levels.

833
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And that's across all world tiers.

834
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
So if you have...

835
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
For example, if you are a level 50 character

836
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and you kill a level 80 monster in Season 4,

837
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
you would only get a level 60 experience.

838
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Now you'll get up to that level 80 experience.

839
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
So it should help out a lot.

840
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
If you are willing to go through more challenging content,

841
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
man, you get more XP for it.

842
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:56,000
So it's really cool.

843
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And it's also really nice

844
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
because it plays really well into

845
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
the stacking Profane Mine Cages,

846
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
which are now available within Helltide

847
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
because that can actually also increase

848
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
monster level by 30 levels as well.

849
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So it's kind of a cool add-on, you could say, from this.

850
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So yeah.

851
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Pretty sweet.

852
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Yeah.

853
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I think that's it for general game updates.

854
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Holy smokes.

855
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Oh, my God.

856
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,000
That's it.

857
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That's it.

858
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Holy moly.

859
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yeah.

860
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
As I talked about a bunch.

861
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah.

862
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It's all on the patch notes.

863
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
You guys will see the patch notes afterwards.

864
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
But yeah.

865
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Yeah.

866
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Really amazing to have all those changes.

867
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Chat was absolutely lighting up

868
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
with regards to all the changes to the pit.

869
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And of course, even though we've shown

870
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
the boss summoning reset again,

871
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
they got just as excited.

872
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Awesome to see.

873
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And we really appreciate everyone's feedback

874
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
during PTR and hearing especially

875
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
about the Helltide stuff.

876
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And we totally hear you guys.

877
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
And we want to make sure that

878
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
people got to experience,

879
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
still enjoy Helltide to the fullest.

880
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yeah.

881
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Like, you know what I mean.

882
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Exactly.

883
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Exactly.

884
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
No, it's really cool to see those.

885
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I talk too much.

886
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah.

887
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Those profan mind cages coming back.

888
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
But yeah, Adam, thank you so much for that.

889
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Yeah.

890
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And now, everyone, I hope you're comfortable

891
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
because we've got a ton to go over

892
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
with regards to updates, uniques,

893
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
some bugs fixes,

894
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
a ton of class balance changes.

895
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Who better to walk us through, Mr. Adam Jackson?

896
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yeah, let's do it.

897
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
So we've got a lot to talk about today.

898
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I'll try and go as quickly as possible.

899
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
So yeah, firstly, you know,

900
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
thank you all for your feedback and comments.

901
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
You know, we got a lot of class-related feedback

902
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
on the PTR, a lot of balance feedback,

903
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
a lot of just how it feels to play things.

904
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And we actually reacted pretty heavily

905
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
and did a lot of changes

906
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
between PTR and Season 5 launch,

907
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
some of which I think some people know

908
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and some things are going to be new for you today.

909
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
So really, yeah,

910
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
we have a lot of things that changed.

911
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
In many ways, honestly,

912
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
it's going to feel like almost

913
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
from a balance perspective

914
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
and kind of what your class can do in your journey,

915
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
it's going to feel almost like a very different game

916
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
compared to what you experienced on the PTR.

917
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I'm going to go through a lot of like

918
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
the systemic reasons why

919
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
and then some specific things

920
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
that we did to every class

921
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
as well as, of course,

922
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
updating all of our uniques

923
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and kind of the impact

924
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
that you can expect from that.

925
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
So lots to talk about.

926
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So first, we're going to be talking about bug fixes.

927
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
We've got quite a few to go through

928
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
that I think are pretty notable.

929
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Again, we're going to be doing

930
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
the class balance updates after that

931
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and then the unique changes.

932
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
So those will be the three things

933
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I'm going to be covering today.

934
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
So firstly, as usual,

935
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
you know we're going to be publishing

936
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
the patch notes right after this

937
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
so you can read all of them.

938
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I'm not going to cover everything today

939
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
but just some of the more notable ones.

940
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
So first is one on the Necromancer

941
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
that we've heard about for a while now.

942
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
It's Shielding Storm.

943
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
This is a legendary

944
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
that when your Bone Storm damages enemies

945
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
you get a barrier equal to your max life.

946
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It used to be based on your base life

947
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
instead of your max life

948
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
and now we finally fixed that.

949
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
To be clear, this is a pretty huge buff.

950
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
We may have to reevaluate the power of this

951
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:51,000
a little later

952
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
but we're going to see how it goes.

953
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But now that barrier

954
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
is going to be very significant

955
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
as you're hitting enemies with this aspect.

956
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Next we've got a couple on the Barbarian.

957
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
The first one is the Twister Glyph.

958
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
This is a Paragon Node Glyph.

959
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It wasn't properly giving you

960
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
bonus multiplicative damage

961
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
when casting Dust Doubles.

962
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
So Dust Doubles builds

963
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
will be a little bit stronger.

964
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
We also fixed an issue

965
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
with the Tempering Earthquake duration.

966
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Beforehand there was a bug

967
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
where it was actually lowering

968
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
the DPS of Earthquake

969
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
because it would increase the duration

970
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
and then your DPS would go down.

971
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So we fixed that.

972
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So it's now actually

973
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
just going to make you hit harder.

974
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Next one,

975
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I'm going to call out

976
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
one of our content creators,

977
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Woody Joe, here.

978
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
This is why we have PTR.

979
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
He found a neat little oversight

980
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,000
that we had

981
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
with a passive called Trick Attacks.

982
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And I'm actually going to go over this

983
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
in a little bit of detail

984
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
because the specs will be coming a little later.

985
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Rank 39 out of 3 seems completely wrong.

986
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Yeah, 39 ranks.

987
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Nothing to see here.

988
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
So offensive passive is pretty good.

989
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
So a little bit of background to this.

990
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Basically we changed

991
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
how this passive Trick Attacks,

992
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
what it does.

993
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It went from something

994
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
that was more utility-based

995
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
where it was around CC

996
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
and we turned it into damage.

997
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
But we didn't update under the hood

998
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
for tempering

999
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
and where it can appear

1000
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,000
from a utility

1001
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
to a damage recipe

1002
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
of where it would show up.

1003
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And so it was appearing on utility

1004
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
which is a lot more

1005
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
common than damage

1006
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
and then you could get it

1007
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
to silly ranks like this.

1008
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So to fix this,

1009
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
right now,

1010
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
or on the PTR I should say,

1011
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
it was on this recipe

1012
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
called Alchemist Control

1013
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
where it was with

1014
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Chilling Weight and Shadow Crash

1015
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
which are also like CC-based passives.

1016
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
For Season 5 launch,

1017
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,000
we're actually going to be

1018
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
disabling this recipe from dropping.

1019
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
You won't be able to see it

1020
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
for a patch

1021
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
while we fix this bug.

1022
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
And what we're going to do

1023
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
is once we re-enable

1024
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
the Alchemist Control recipe

1025
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:36,000
to drop,

1026
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Trick Attacks won't be on here anymore.

1027
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
What we're actually going to be doing

1028
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
is we're going to be taking Flurry Size

1029
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
from another recipe

1030
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
called Rogue Innovation here.

1031
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
We're going to be moving Flurry Size

1032
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
which is more of a utility-based thing

1033
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
and moving that over

1034
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,000
to Alchemist Control

1035
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and then just removing Trick Attacks

1036
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
from Alchemist Control.

1037
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
So the net effect of this

1038
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,000
will be that

1039
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
now both recipes will have,

1040
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,000
or yeah,

1041
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
both Temporary recipes

1042
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
will have three different options

1043
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
of what you can have there.

1044
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And Rogue Innovation

1045
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
will actually have a little bit

1046
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
of a buff here too

1047
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
because instead of having

1048
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
four things to, you know,

1049
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
roll for your Tempers,

1050
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
we're only going to have three.

1051
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So it'll be a little bit easier

1052
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
to get what you want.

1053
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Next, we're going to be talking about

1054
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
some generic class balance updates.

1055
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
So kind of to set you up,

1056
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
a high-level theme

1057
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,000
that we're going to see

1058
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
in our feedback from PTR

1059
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
was Barbarians are really, really good

1060
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
and oh, every other class

1061
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
is kind of a little bit weak

1062
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
it feels like

1063
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
compared to Barbarians.

1064
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So we did a lot of things

1065
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
to address this.

1066
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
So first I want to go into detail

1067
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
a little bit of how we feel

1068
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
about Barbarians

1069
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
and where they're at

1070
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
and what we want to do.

1071
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We feel like one of the bigger reasons

1072
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
why Barbarians are so strong

1073
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
is that they kind of have

1074
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
two class mechanics

1075
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
compared to other classes, right?

1076
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
They have the expertise system

1077
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
which is like a normal class mechanic

1078
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
where, you know,

1079
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
they have this fantasy

1080
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
of leveling up their weapons

1081
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
and then they get bonuses

1082
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
but then they also get

1083
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
more item slots

1084
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
compared to other classes

1085
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
so they get more access

1086
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
to more legendary powers.

1087
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
As far as how we tackle this

1088
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
we don't want our only solution

1089
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
to be the nerf Barbarians, right?

1090
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Like a common thing

1091
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
that we hear is like

1092
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
hey, they have more item slots

1093
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
maybe you should just get rid

1094
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:03,000
of the item slots

1095
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
so that everybody has parity, right?

1096
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Like that is a way

1097
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
to make parity

1098
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,000
but, you know,

1099
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
it takes away from their theme

1100
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
of being a master of weapons

1101
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and it's not very fun.

1102
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
So that's not the only thing

1103
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
that we want to do

1104
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,000
in this situation.

1105
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
The other thing is

1106
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
that we want to keep

1107
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
their class identity, right?

1108
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Another common suggestion

1109
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,000
we hear is

1110
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
well, just give all the other classes

1111
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,000
more item slots

1112
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
so that they're the same

1113
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
as Barbarian, right?

1114
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And similarly,

1115
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,000
kind of like how

1116
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Necromancers have minions

1117
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
we don't want to give

1118
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
every class minions

1119
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
just because, you know,

1120
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,000
they don't have access

1121
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
to the cool thing

1122
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
that Necromancers do.

1123
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
We don't want to just give

1124
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
every class, you know,

1125
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
more slots

1126
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
so that they're exactly

1127
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
the same as Barbarian.

1128
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
We want to really try

1129
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
and keep what makes them

1130
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
feel special

1131
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
as a special thing

1132
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
and find other ways

1133
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
to kind of bring parity

1134
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
to the classes.

1135
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So here's kind of

1136
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:47,000
our strategy

1137
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
of what we're thinking

1138
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,000
of with Barbarians.

1139
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
We have a few different things

1140
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
that we're going to be doing.

1141
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
One is we're actually

1142
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,000
going to be adjusting

1143
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
how much damage

1144
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
all the classes get

1145
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
from their core stat

1146
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,000
and this is going to bring

1147
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
other classes up

1148
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
to the level of Barbarian.

1149
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I'm going to be going

1150
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
over that in a little bit.

1151
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
We are going to be

1152
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
reducing the power of Barbarians

1153
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
as part of our solution

1154
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
but again,

1155
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I want to point out

1156
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
it's not the only thing

1157
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
that we want to do

1158
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
and then we also want

1159
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
to target the other

1160
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
class mechanics

1161
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
and really bring them

1162
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
up to the level

1163
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
of the Barbarian

1164
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
effectively having two

1165
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
and making the other

1166
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
classes feel cool

1167
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
in the way that makes

1168
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
them thematic and awesome.

1169
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
We already actually

1170
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,000
experimented with this

1171
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
in season four.

1172
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
This was an intentional

1173
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
thing that we did

1174
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,000
and we wanted to see

1175
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
how it went

1176
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
with the Necromancer.

1177
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
If you remember,

1178
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
we buffed minions

1179
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,000
very heavily

1180
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
and we also buffed

1181
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
the Book of the Dead,

1182
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
their class mechanic,

1183
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,000
very heavily.

1184
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Not just numbers

1185
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
but also in the

1186
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,000
cool factor,

1187
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,000
right?

1188
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
You have mechanics

1189
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
like your minions

1190
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
can throw bone spears

1191
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
or your golem

1192
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:37,000
can do bone spikes

1193
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
everywhere and make

1194
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
enemies vulnerable.

1195
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
We want to do

1196
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
this kind of treatment

1197
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
to the other

1198
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
class mechanics.

1199
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Just to be clear,

1200
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,000
we're going to be

1201
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
probably doing this

1202
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
after the Vessel

1203
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,000
of Hatred expansion

1204
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
launches,

1205
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
so it'll be a little bit.

1206
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
So we are doing

1207
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,000
some things in the

1208
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
meantime to catch them up

1209
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
but you can expect

1210
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
in the future

1211
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
we're going to be doing

1212
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
kind of a big overhaul

1213
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
to the other classes

1214
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
similarly to the

1215
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Book of the Dead

1216
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
and so their cool factor

1217
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
and their power level

1218
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
is going to be going up.

1219
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
So let's talk about

1220
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
that core stat update

1221
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
that I talked about

1222
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
previously.

1223
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
So basically what

1224
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,000
we're doing here

1225
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
is we're going to be

1226
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
changing the amount

1227
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
of damage that every

1228
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
class gets from

1229
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
their core stat.

1230
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So if you didn't know

1231
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
on live right now

1232
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
when you log into

1233
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,000
the game you get

1234
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
about 1% more damage

1235
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
per 10 stat

1236
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
of your class.

1237
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So as an example

1238
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,000
you know the

1239
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I don't know

1240
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,000
pick one,

1241
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
the Sorceress

1242
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,000
you know with

1243
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Intelligence you would

1244
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
have 10 int

1245
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:25,000
and then you would

1246
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
get 1% more damage.

1247
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
If you had 100 int

1248
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
you'd have 10% more

1249
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
damage and so on.

1250
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So now it's going

1251
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
to actually depend

1252
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,000
on the class

1253
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
what that ratio is

1254
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
of how much damage

1255
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
you get per your

1256
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,000
core stat.

1257
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
So the Barbarian

1258
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
is going to be

1259
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:37,000
staying exactly the

1260
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
same, 1% more damage

1261
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
per 10 strength.

1262
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
The Rogue is going

1263
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
to get a little bit

1264
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
of a buff here

1265
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
because they do have

1266
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,000
a little bit more

1267
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
slots compared to

1268
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
other classes

1269
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,000
so they're going to

1270
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
be getting 1% more

1271
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
damage per 9 decks

1272
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
and then the other

1273
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
3 classes, the

1274
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Sorceress, Druid,

1275
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
and Necromancer

1276
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,000
are going to be getting

1277
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
1% more damage

1278
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
per 8 core stat.

1279
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
So without doing

1280
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
a lot of math

1281
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
the TLDR here

1282
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
is Barbarians

1283
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
are staying the same

1284
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Rogues are going

1285
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:01,000
to get a bit of a

1286
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
bump, a bit of a

1287
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
buff, and the other

1288
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,000
3 classes are going

1289
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
to get even more

1290
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
damage.

1291
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So as you get

1292
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
that core stat

1293
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,000
which you get

1294
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
very commonly

1295
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
in Gear and Paragon

1296
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:09,000
and other places

1297
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
you're just going

1298
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
to be doing more

1299
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,000
damage.

1300
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
It's just a passive

1301
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,000
way that we're

1302
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
going to be catching

1303
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,000
up the classes

1304
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
stat-wise.

1305
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
So next let's move

1306
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
on to kind of

1307
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
our class updates.

1308
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,000
So I'm going to be

1309
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
going through all

1310
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
the different classes

1311
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,000
and talking about

1312
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
kind of what our

1313
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
updates are going

1314
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,000
to be for them.

1315
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Some of the things

1316
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
you can expect

1317
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
that are different

1318
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
from PTR to launch.

1319
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
So Barbarian

1320
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
you know currently

1321
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Barbarians in addition

1322
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
to having more

1323
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
item slots

1324
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,000
have some of the

1325
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
best key passives

1326
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:37,000
in the game

1327
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
like in Season 4

1328
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
and on live.

1329
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
One of the very

1330
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
main ways that we're

1331
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
targeting bringing

1332
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
them down is

1333
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,000
reducing the power

1334
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
level so that really

1335
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,000
their key passes

1336
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
are comparable to

1337
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
other classes.

1338
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
We on the team

1339
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:49,000
felt like you know

1340
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
they already have

1341
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,000
all these other

1342
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
things that are

1343
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
really strong going

1344
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,000
for them.

1345
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
They don't need

1346
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
like overly

1347
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
stated way

1348
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
powerful key passives

1349
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
that do like you

1350
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
know over 100%

1351
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
multiplicative damage

1352
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,000
when the other

1353
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
classes are doing

1354
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
way less.

1355
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
So you did see

1356
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
that on the PTR.

1357
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
We did see a lot

1358
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
of feedback on like

1359
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
why are we bringing

1360
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:07,000
down Walking Arsenal

1361
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
to have parity

1362
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
when you know

1363
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
it wasn't even

1364
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:10,000
really meta

1365
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
compared to the

1366
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:11,000
other key passives

1367
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and I just kind of

1368
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
wanted to bring

1369
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
some light to this

1370
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
of how we think

1371
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:15,000
about it.

1372
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
The reason why

1373
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,000
we brought

1374
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Walking Arsenal

1375
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
to be level

1376
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,000
with the other

1377
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
ones when we

1378
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,000
brought them

1379
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,000
to be equal

1380
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
to other classes

1381
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
is that you

1382
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
know we want

1383
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
all the key

1384
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,000
passes on

1385
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Barbarian to

1386
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,000
have parity

1387
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,000
with each

1388
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
other.

1389
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,000
If we just

1390
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
brought down

1391
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:26,000
the other

1392
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
key passives

1393
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,000
that were way

1394
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
over performing

1395
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
and didn't bring

1396
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Walking Arsenal

1397
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
down to be even

1398
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,000
with them

1399
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,000
then really

1400
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Walking Arsenal

1401
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,000
is just going

1402
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
to be the best

1403
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
mandatory pick

1404
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,000
and every

1405
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Barbarian build

1406
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,000
is going to

1407
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
have to interact

1408
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,000
with this system

1409
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
and we really

1410
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
wanted them to

1411
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
be equal with

1412
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:39,000
each other

1413
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
so that you

1414
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,000
know there's

1415
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
actually a choice

1416
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
when you get

1417
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,000
to your key

1418
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
passive of which

1419
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,000
one to take.

1420
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:44,000
So I just

1421
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
wanted to clarify

1422
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,000
that of you

1423
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
know what our

1424
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
thinking was there.

1425
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
But you know

1426
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
it's not all

1427
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:50,000
doom and gloom

1428
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
for Barbarians

1429
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
you know we

1430
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
did hear feedback

1431
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:53,000
of like man

1432
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
it really sucks

1433
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,000
you know I

1434
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
understand that

1435
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,000
they're being

1436
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,000
brought down

1437
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
and it's fair

1438
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
but you know

1439
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:57,000
we want to

1440
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:57,000
have some

1441
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
things to look

1442
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:58,000
forward to.

1443
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So we did

1444
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
introduce a number

1445
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
of buffs coming

1446
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
in between PTR

1447
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,000
and live so that

1448
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
you have some

1449
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,000
things to look

1450
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
forward to

1451
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,000
and new build

1452
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
paths or your

1453
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
you know

1454
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:06,000
underperforming

1455
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
builds are not

1456
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
being brought

1457
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:08,000
down as well.

1458
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So I'm going

1459
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
to give a couple

1460
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
of examples here.

1461
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,000
One is Hammer

1462
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
of the Ancients.

1463
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
We increased

1464
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
its damage baseline

1465
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,000
by 10%

1466
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and we also

1467
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,000
adjusted the

1468
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
of Ancestral

1469
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Force Legendary.

1470
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
One of the

1471
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
troubling things

1472
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
that this build

1473
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,000
has problems

1474
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
with is like

1475
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
single target

1476
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:23,000
damage against

1477
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
bosses and

1478
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,000
things.

1479
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You know it

1480
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,000
does really

1481
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,000
good in AOE

1482
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and brings down

1483
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
enemies but

1484
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,000
it's single

1485
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
targets a little

1486
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,000
bit lacking.

1487
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So we're

1488
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,000
upgrading this

1489
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
legendary power

1490
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
so now it's

1491
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:31,000
going to be

1492
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
doing more

1493
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,000
damage against

1494
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
bosses so it'll

1495
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,000
kind of help

1496
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
you with that

1497
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,000
single target

1498
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
issue.

1499
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Another one is

1500
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Upheaval.

1501
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Upheaval builds

1502
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
can rejoice and

1503
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,000
also a little bit

1504
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
of a preview of

1505
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,000
kind of how we're

1506
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
changing uniques

1507
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
which I'll be going

1508
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,000
over a lot more

1509
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
later.

1510
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
We're increasing

1511
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,000
upheaval damage

1512
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
by about 15%

1513
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
and we also

1514
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:48,000
rounded out

1515
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Hellhammer now.

1516
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It's quite a bit

1517
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
more powerful.

1518
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I can point out

1519
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
a bunch of things

1520
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,000
here of how it's

1521
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
better but you

1522
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
can see it gives

1523
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
more skill ranks

1524
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
of Upheaval

1525
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
compared to before.

1526
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
The damage of

1527
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
its burning on

1528
01:19:59,000 --> 01:19:59,000
the ground just

1529
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
baseline went up.

1530
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,000
It also has

1531
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
scaling on the

1532
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
burning damage.

1533
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
So before the

1534
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,000
burning damage

1535
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
wasn't really a

1536
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
meaningful part of

1537
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,000
the unique.

1538
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
One of the things

1539
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,000
you're going to see

1540
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
with uniques across

1541
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:09,000
the board is that

1542
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
they're going to be

1543
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
a lot more about

1544
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
the thematic of

1545
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,000
what the unique is

1546
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
and that's where

1547
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
their power is going

1548
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,000
to be.

1549
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So here the

1550
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,000
burning ground

1551
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
actually will scale

1552
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
with your strength

1553
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:17,000
at a pretty

1554
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
significant degree.

1555
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
So it'll actually

1556
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
be doing meaningful

1557
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,000
damage hopefully.

1558
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You can also see

1559
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
its inherent affix

1560
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
now is damage

1561
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,000
to burning enemies

1562
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
instead of

1563
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
overpower damage.

1564
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
So it's going with

1565
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
that theme of

1566
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Hellhammer burning

1567
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
the ground.

1568
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
It's also giving you

1569
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
skill ranks of

1570
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
wall up, a passive

1571
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,000
so that's more

1572
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
multiplicative damage.

1573
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:35,000
You also get

1574
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Upheaval size.

1575
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:36,000
So now your burning

1576
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
ground and your

1577
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
upheaval is going to

1578
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,000
be bigger.

1579
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
So there's just all

1580
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
kinds of new things

1581
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,000
going on.

1582
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
It's going to be a lot

1583
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
cooler, a lot more

1584
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
powerful, and hopefully

1585
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
a lot more fun.

1586
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Hellhammer looks

1587
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
absolutely insane.

1588
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Yeah.

1589
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
300 strength also by

1590
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:49,000
the way.

1591
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
No big deal.

1592
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:50,000
300 strength no big

1593
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
deal.

1594
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:51,000
360 strength.

1595
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
No big deal.

1596
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,000
No big deal.

1597
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:53,000
It's going to be

1598
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:53,000
pretty good.

1599
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
So next, the

1600
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
sorceress.

1601
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:56,000
We got a whole lot

1602
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
of feedback that

1603
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
the sorceress isn't

1604
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
powerful enough

1605
01:20:59,000 --> 01:20:59,000
compared to other

1606
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
classes.

1607
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
We got so much.

1608
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I'm going to stop

1609
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
us right here.

1610
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
We got so much

1611
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
feedback about the

1612
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:05,000
sorceress.

1613
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Just a little bit.

1614
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And the druid.

1615
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And the druid.

1616
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And the necromancer.

1617
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I will just note,

1618
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
we hear you guys.

1619
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
We absolutely do.

1620
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Okay, now you may

1621
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
continue.

1622
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So, for the

1623
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
sorceress specifically,

1624
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
we heard feedback that

1625
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,000
they're not powerful

1626
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
enough.

1627
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
So we did quite a few

1628
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
things to address it.

1629
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Firstly, they've got a

1630
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
lot of large buffs to

1631
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
their uniques.

1632
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I would say even more

1633
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
than other classes.

1634
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Your uniques are going

1635
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
to feel really good is

1636
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
the hope, and I think

1637
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
we've hit it.

1638
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And I'll be going over

1639
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,000
some of them a little

1640
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
bit later.

1641
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
We also buffed all of

1642
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
their core and mastery

1643
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
skills by about 15 to

1644
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,000
20%.

1645
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So just baseline.

1646
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Remember, this is in

1647
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
addition to the core

1648
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,000
stat buff.

1649
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
All of your core and

1650
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
mastery skills are also

1651
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
getting buffed baseline

1652
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
by a pretty significant

1653
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,000
degree.

1654
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
So you're just going to

1655
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
hit harder.

1656
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
We also did multiple

1657
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
defensive buffs.

1658
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,000
You know, we heard a

1659
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
lot of feedback that

1660
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,000
they have trouble

1661
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
surviving in situations

1662
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,000
that the other classes

1663
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
could kind of get away

1664
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,000
with.

1665
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
These are some examples.

1666
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
We did more than this.

1667
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
But ice armor, your

1668
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
base shield amount is

1669
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
going up from 40% to

1670
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
56% of your max life.

1671
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Snow Veiled aspect.

1672
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
This one was updated

1673
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
from PTR to launch.

1674
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
So on PTR, it was that

1675
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
your ice armor gave you

1676
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
unstoppable and gave you

1677
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
armor.

1678
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And on launch, you're

1679
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,000
still going to get

1680
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
unstoppable, but you're

1681
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
going to get damage

1682
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
reduction, which, you

1683
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,000
know, anyone who knows

1684
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
how the defenses within

1685
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
this game work is way

1686
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
more significant than

1687
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
just getting armor.

1688
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Yeah.

1689
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:20,000
When you hit that armor

1690
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
cap, it's kind of like

1691
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Yeah, you just want to

1692
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
gobble up DR like

1693
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Pac-Man.

1694
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
As much as you can get,

1695
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
the more the better,

1696
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,000
and this is going to

1697
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
give you.

1698
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Yeah, the DR is going

1699
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
to be huge.

1700
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Very big.

1701
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Also, we did multiple

1702
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
buffs to the Paragon

1703
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:32,000
board.

1704
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Again, this is not

1705
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
covering everything, but

1706
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
one of the things is that

1707
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
we put a lot of caps to

1708
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
make sure that some

1709
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Paragon oses just didn't

1710
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
go out of control compared

1711
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
to everything else, but

1712
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
we heard feedback that

1713
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
those caps were a little

1714
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
bit too punishing, so we

1715
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
increased them.

1716
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
An example here is

1717
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Burning Instinct, where

1718
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
on PTR, it capped at

1719
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
40% more multiplicative

1720
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
damage, and we increased

1721
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
that up to 80%.

1722
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So now your Burning

1723
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
damage, that's based on

1724
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
your crit strike multiplier,

1725
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
multiplier is going to be

1726
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,000
going up.

1727
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Your total amount is

1728
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
going to go up, but

1729
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
then also the rate that

1730
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
you get it.

1731
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
It used to be 1% per 50

1732
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
int, now it's 1% per 20

1733
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,000
int.

1734
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So you'll be getting

1735
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
more efficient bane for

1736
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
your buck for your int,

1737
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
and a total cap that's

1738
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:10,000
much higher.

1739
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
So Druid, similar to

1740
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Sorceress, surprise,

1741
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
surprise, got a lot of

1742
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:16,000
feedback that it's not

1743
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
powerful enough compared

1744
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
to the Barbarian or

1745
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,000
other classes.

1746
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
So we've got a lot of

1747
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
multiple quality of life

1748
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
and damage buffs coming

1749
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,000
in.

1750
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Again, these are just some

1751
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
examples.

1752
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Also, you've got to

1753
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,000
remember the Uniques

1754
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
are going to be coming

1755
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
in as well.

1756
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Boulder damage went up.

1757
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
We increased the damage

1758
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
across the board of their

1759
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
core skills mostly, and

1760
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
we missed Boulder, so

1761
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
we're increasing their

1762
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,000
damage a bit.

1763
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
We also got a lot of

1764
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
feedback that we came

1765
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:39,000
out with this really cool

1766
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Unique for Cataclysm that

1767
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
made the Lightning Bolts

1768
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
smart and target enemies,

1769
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
and a lot of people were

1770
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
like, hey, why does it

1771
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
have to get a Unique to

1772
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
make my skill be smart?

1773
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
And we agreed, so we

1774
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
just made the skill smart

1775
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,000
baseline.

1776
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
So now those Lightning

1777
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Bolts from the Ultimate

1778
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
will just target enemies.

1779
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Perfect Storm, the Storm

1780
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
key passive is getting

1781
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
its damage boosted from

1782
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
30 to 40%.

1783
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Seismic Shift, this was

1784
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
an aspect that we think

1785
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
is really cool where your

1786
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Earth Spike kind of goes

1787
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
in a line and does a

1788
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
bunch of Earth Spikes.

1789
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
It used to have a Kiss

1790
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Curse mechanic, and it no

1791
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
longer does.

1792
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So before, it used to

1793
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
give you this big bonus of

1794
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
way more resource reduction

1795
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
gen and more damage on it,

1796
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
but it added a cooldown,

1797
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
and now it just doesn't

1798
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
add a cooldown, so you can

1799
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
spam it and cast a bunch of

1800
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Earth Spikes everywhere.

1801
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
It should be a lot more

1802
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:23,000
fun.

1803
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Also, similar to the

1804
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Sorceress, we're buffing

1805
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
their little bonus cap on

1806
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
their Legendary Paragon

1807
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,000
nodes.

1808
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
So an example here, you

1809
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
know, they went from 40%

1810
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
to 60%, so you've got

1811
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Thunderstruck, Earthen

1812
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Devastation, and Survival

1813
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Instincts.

1814
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
We've got a little visual

1815
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
there at the bottom node,

1816
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
but you can see that that

1817
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
top end of the damage is

1818
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
now 60%, so it's going to

1819
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,000
be better than PTR.

1820
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Also, we came out with that

1821
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
new Unique I mentioned for

1822
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Cataclysm.

1823
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It used to be on the gloves

1824
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
on PTR, which a lot of

1825
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
people, which we agreed

1826
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
with, you know, it kind of

1827
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,000
felt bad that, you know,

1828
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
you've got the two Storm

1829
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
related Uniques on the same

1830
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
slot, you can't take them

1831
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
together.

1832
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It was competing with

1833
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Unsun Aesthetics Wraps.

1834
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
This was the Lightning

1835
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Storm Unique.

1836
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
But now it's going to be on

1837
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
the ring slot, so now you

1838
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
can take them both together,

1839
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,000
so they're not competing

1840
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
with each other anymore.

1841
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Next is the Rogue.

1842
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
So, to be frank, the Rogue

1843
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
is, we feel like it's in a

1844
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
pretty good spot, so we

1845
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
didn't do as many changes

1846
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
compared to other classes.

1847
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
We did still do a few that

1848
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I'll mention today, but

1849
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
they got the least changes.

1850
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
The first one is Flurry.

1851
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So, as you know, if you

1852
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
played the PTR, Flurry got

1853
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
some pretty dramatic

1854
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,000
updates, right?

1855
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Both of their enhancement

1856
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
and both of their choices

1857
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
that you could pick on the

1858
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
base skill got changed and

1859
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
made a lot better.

1860
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
We saw that, you know, a

1861
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
lot of the output of Flurry

1862
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
was related to doing the

1863
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
mechanics that the

1864
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
enhancement and the advanced

1865
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Flurry were requiring you

1866
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
to do, like casting it a

1867
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,000
bunch of times in a row and

1868
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
stuff like that.

1869
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
And we wanted to move some

1870
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
of that damage from those

1871
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
enhancements and things into

1872
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,000
the base skill.

1873
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
So, the enhancement and the

1874
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
advanced force are going to

1875
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
be pretty potent, but we

1876
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
lower their damage and

1877
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
instead just juice the base

1878
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:55,000
skill even more.

1879
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And what this is going to

1880
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
mean is really just that

1881
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
you're going to be more

1882
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
consistently doing that

1883
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
damage and you're going to

1884
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
be less reliant on doing

1885
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
the stacking mechanics to

1886
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,000
get it.

1887
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Next, Windforce.

1888
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
You know, this one has had

1889
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
a troubled history of just

1890
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
trying to find ways to make

1891
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
it really good and useful.

1892
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Instead of knocking back

1893
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
enemies when it procs, it's

1894
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
going to knock them down

1895
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:13,000
now.

1896
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
So, you no longer have to

1897
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
worry about knocking enemies

1898
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
out of your CC, you know, or

1899
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
you want them to be grouped

1900
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,000
up next to you and then

1901
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
you're just knocking one of

1902
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
them or a few of them away.

1903
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Now they're just going to go

1904
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
in place.

1905
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
We have a before and after

1906
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
here.

1907
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Again, a little preview of

1908
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,000
what we're doing with our

1909
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
uniques.

1910
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
But, yeah, Windforce, you

1911
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
can see some of the things

1912
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
here as a preview is going to

1913
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
give you move speed baseline,

1914
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
which is pretty interesting

1915
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
as a stat on a bow.

1916
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
You've got chance for double

1917
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
projectiles for your barrage.

1918
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
You've got a couple passive

1919
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,000
upgrades there.

1920
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And then, as you can see, the

1921
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
damage went up, but also now

1922
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
it knocks down enemies

1923
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
instead of knocks them back.

1924
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Last but not least, the

1925
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Necromancer.

1926
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
We've been hearing a lot of

1927
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
feedback that blood Necromancer

1928
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
players are a little sad.

1929
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:53,000
They just aren't really

1930
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
catching up to the other

1931
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
versions of Necromancer.

1932
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
So, we've buffed up a bunch

1933
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
of their tempering recipes

1934
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
and the damage on them.

1935
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
We're also buffing their

1936
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
legendary paragon nodes.

1937
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Here's some here that we did.

1938
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Bloodbath.

1939
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
This one just makes your

1940
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
overpower damage go up.

1941
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
It's being doubled from 35%

1942
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
to 70%, so that's pretty

1943
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,000
meaty.

1944
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Blood begets blood.

1945
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
That damage bonus when you're

1946
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
picking up blood orbs is

1947
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
being doubled and the

1948
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
maximum amount is being

1949
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,000
doubled.

1950
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So, you're getting more per

1951
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
stack and you need less

1952
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
stacks to get to your max

1953
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:19,000
damage.

1954
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
So, pretty good there.

1955
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And then last but not least

1956
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
here, Lucky Hit.

1957
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
We've heard a lot of

1958
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,000
feedback from Necromancer

1959
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
players that, you know,

1960
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
they kind of rely a lot on

1961
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
the Miasma corpse explosion

1962
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
to get their Lucky Hit

1963
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
procs off and that their

1964
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
other skills don't really

1965
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
compete and so they can't

1966
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
really have fun with

1967
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Lucky Hit based builds,

1968
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
you know, more generally.

1969
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
So, we just buffed Lucky

1970
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Hit on a bunch of

1971
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
different skills so you can

1972
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
see there what all the

1973
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
numbers are.

1974
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Again, those will be on the

1975
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
patch notes, but really

1976
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:45,000
they're just going to be

1977
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Lucky Hit hitting more

1978
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
often and getting cool

1979
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,000
procs more.

1980
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Alright, so next, let's

1981
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
talk about Uniques a little

1982
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:52,000
bit, right?

1983
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I'm super excited about

1984
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:54,000
this.

1985
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Yeah, so, as we promised,

1986
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
you know, in the PTR stream,

1987
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
you know, we said that, you

1988
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
know, we have this kind of

1989
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
different philosophy when it

1990
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:02,000
comes to Uniques and we

1991
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
went into detail there and

1992
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
we updated our Uniques

1993
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
coming into Season 5 but we

1994
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
didn't update all of our

1995
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
existing Uniques in the

1996
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,000
game yet.

1997
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So, we've done that pass now,

1998
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
we've updated nearly every

1999
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Unique in the game and I'm

2000
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
going to do a little bit of a

2001
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
recap of kind of how we

2002
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
thought and then giving you

2003
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
some examples of what we

2004
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:17,000
did.

2005
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
So, these updates are fairly

2006
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,000
dramatic.

2007
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
They're going to be showing

2008
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
you three from each class as

2009
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
well as three generic ones to

2010
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
give you a really meaty idea of

2011
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
the different categories and

2012
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
ways that we thought of

2013
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
updating Uniques and kind of,

2014
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
you know, what you can expect

2015
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
for your builds.

2016
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Yeah, and I know, and

2017
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Marcus is going to remind us

2018
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
about this at the end as well.

2019
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Oh, you'll be hearing it a

2020
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,000
lot.

2021
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Yeah, but I will say we are

2022
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
showing three here for every

2023
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
class and three generic ones

2024
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
but every single Unique is

2025
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
actually in the patch notes

2026
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
and we have a before and

2027
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
after in the patch notes so

2028
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
you guys will have easy access

2029
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
and you can see.

2030
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
You can easily compare the two

2031
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
and see what was the

2032
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
difference.

2033
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
So, after the stream you'll

2034
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
be able to compare and so

2035
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
we're just only covering a

2036
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
small amount here.

2037
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
We'll see everything.

2038
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Just a little sample

2039
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,000
serving.

2040
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
The patch notes are absolutely

2041
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
massive so you'll have a lot

2042
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
to have lots of snack on

2043
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:06,000
there.

2044
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
So, yeah.

2045
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
So, one of the things is your

2046
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
general power level of

2047
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Unique Effects is up and by

2048
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Unique Effects I want to be

2049
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:14,000
clear.

2050
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
That is like the thing at the

2051
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
bottom that is like your,

2052
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
you know, deals 40 to 60%

2053
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
more multiplicative damage or

2054
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:20,000
whatever.

2055
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
That number is going to be up

2056
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
on the higher end.

2057
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
So, instead of 40 to 60, you

2058
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
know, it'll be 40 to 80 or

2059
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
40 to 90 or 40 to whatever,

2060
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:27,000
right?

2061
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
So, that power level is just

2062
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
going to be generally up almost

2063
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
across the board.

2064
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And then really what we

2065
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
targeted for these updates is

2066
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
the stats on the Uniques.

2067
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
So, the stats are going to

2068
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
pretty much break every rule

2069
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
that we had in the game

2070
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
before when it comes to

2071
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
being a cool item.

2072
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
So, some things that you're

2073
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
going to see, and I think I

2074
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
got an example of most of,

2075
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
if not all of these, but

2076
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
you're going to see Uniques

2077
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
that have different inherents

2078
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
compared to other stats.

2079
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So, you know, your boot

2080
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
inherent, you know, could be

2081
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
something that's not even

2082
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
related to boots or movement

2083
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:55,000
anymore.

2084
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It could be something else.

2085
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Or sometimes we add more

2086
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
inherent stats.

2087
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
So, something that didn't

2088
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
exist before, you know, some

2089
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
items can have two inherents

2090
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
instead of just one, which is

2091
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
a pretty big difference.

2092
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
We have a lot more that have

2093
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
stats that break normal slot

2094
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,000
rules.

2095
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
So, you know, things like

2096
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
movement speed on bows or

2097
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
cooldown reduction on weapons,

2098
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
stuff like that.

2099
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Uniques also can now have

2100
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
tempering affixes, right?

2101
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
None of them really did this

2102
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
in Season 4, but now that

2103
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
tempering's in the game and

2104
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Uniques have to compete with

2105
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
these really great tempered

2106
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
items, Uniques can have that

2107
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
too.

2108
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
They can also have much higher

2109
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
potential stat values compared

2110
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
to normal items.

2111
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
So, you know, if a normal item

2112
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
has 20 to 40% more damage, a

2113
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Unique can be like, you know,

2114
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
1 to 300% more damage or

2115
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
whatever, right?

2116
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
And we even do this with the

2117
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:36,000
tempered affixes.

2118
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
So, Unique can have juiced up

2119
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
versions of tempered affixes that

2120
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
make them solve those problems

2121
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,000
much quicker.

2122
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Also, we've introduced a lot of

2123
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
stats that really have powerful

2124
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
effects on them.

2125
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Sometimes even a single stat on

2126
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
a Unique can have the impact

2127
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
that a legendary power normally

2128
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
would on an item as far as what

2129
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,000
it does to a build.

2130
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And we'll have a couple

2131
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
examples of that where, like, a

2132
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
stat on an item is actually

2133
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
giving you a new effect that

2134
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
didn't exist before that you

2135
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
could do.

2136
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
That's awesome.

2137
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Yeah.

2138
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
So, again, we're going to be

2139
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
going through three examples

2140
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
per class and three generics.

2141
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And I'm going to just try and

2142
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
quickly go through and kind of

2143
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
point out some of the key

2144
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
things that are kind of neat

2145
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,000
about the items.

2146
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
So, we're going to shotgun this

2147
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,000
a little bit.

2148
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And, yeah, you're going to see

2149
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
some cool items.

2150
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,000
So, let's get to it.

2151
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Yeah.

2152
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
So, first, Penitent Greaves.

2153
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
This is a generic Unique.

2154
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
You can see here, this one now

2155
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
has two inherents as opposed

2156
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
to one.

2157
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Another thing that you can

2158
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
notice is that normally,

2159
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
you know, the inherent, the

2160
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
evaded grants more move

2161
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
speed is only for one second.

2162
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
And this one is not only has

2163
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
two inherents, but it's for

2164
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
two seconds.

2165
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
So, you'll evade and, like,

2166
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
you know, boost around that

2167
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
crazy sonic speed for a

2168
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
couple seconds, which is

2169
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
pretty neat.

2170
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
And now you can run through

2171
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
enemies while you do it.

2172
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
We've also got some neat

2173
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
stats there, like crit chance

2174
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
against chilled enemies and

2175
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
chilled potency there that are

2176
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
new to the game.

2177
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Here, Fists of Fate.

2178
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
This one a lot of people saw

2179
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
a little bit early and they

2180
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
were very happy about.

2181
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
So, one thing I think that's

2182
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
kind of cool is that with

2183
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:58,000
our uniques, we're really

2184
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
trying to, like, double and

2185
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
triple down on the fantasy of

2186
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,000
the item.

2187
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So, you know, something's about

2188
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
cold or something here, like

2189
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
this, the Fate is about, like,

2190
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
RNG to the max.

2191
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So, we're really going hard on,

2192
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
like, what the theme is.

2193
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:09,000
So, here you can see, like,

2194
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
your attack speed can go from

2195
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
0.1 to 0.7.

2196
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
And everything on it is, like,

2197
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
has a huge range of what you

2198
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:15,000
can roll.

2199
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
So, like, a greater affixed

2200
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Fists of Fate could be, like,

2201
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
a best-in-slot item for a lot

2202
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,000
of builds.

2203
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
The lucky hit chance on this.

2204
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Yes, this is the one that

2205
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
people point out that we...

2206
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:25,000
It's just crazy.

2207
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I talked with one of the

2208
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
people on our team.

2209
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I want to shout out Alex on

2210
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
our team who did a lot of

2211
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
this work.

2212
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And we had a choice here.

2213
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And we're like, are we going

2214
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
to go crazy or go

2215
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
conservative?

2216
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I was like, you know, let's

2217
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:36,000
just go crazy.

2218
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Like, this might be insane.

2219
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
It might actually be best in

2220
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
slot-in-break stuff, but it's

2221
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
really cool.

2222
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
So, yeah, greater affixed

2223
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Fists of Fate there is going

2224
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,000
to be really cool.

2225
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Next, the grandfather.

2226
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Mythic unique example here.

2227
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You know, a lot of people

2228
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
had issues with the ignored

2229
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
durability loss, you know,

2230
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
where you would, like,

2231
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Masterwork hit that or

2232
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:53,000
something, and then you're

2233
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
not getting anything.

2234
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
We just moved that into be a,

2235
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
you know, a baseline inherent

2236
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
affix now, so you don't have

2237
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
to worry about that, and then

2238
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
replaced it with something

2239
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
useful with a max resource.

2240
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And I will note, like,

2241
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
even in Season 4, because

2242
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
that durability loss was kind

2243
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:07,000
of...

2244
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
was actually a hidden

2245
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
stat item.

2246
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Sometimes, when you found a

2247
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
greater affixed version of a

2248
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
grandfather, it would

2249
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
actually apply to that.

2250
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
That is now...

2251
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Yeah, that's all gone.

2252
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
It's just...

2253
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Inherence can't be greater,

2254
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,000
which is something that we

2255
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
thought of a lot with this.

2256
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Yeah, so now let's go into

2257
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,000
the classes.

2258
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Barbarian.

2259
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
This is Battle Trance.

2260
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
This one exists already on

2261
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,000
live.

2262
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Probably the two big things

2263
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
here.

2264
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
One is, you know, you have

2265
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
two different passives now

2266
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:35,000
that you get.

2267
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
A lot of times we're adding

2268
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
skill ranks to passives,

2269
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,000
because that's a way to add

2270
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
multiplicative damage, or

2271
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
just buffs to really cool

2272
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
effects on a unique, the

2273
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,000
other stats.

2274
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
The other thing to point out

2275
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
here is the actual effect.

2276
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Before, it was giving you

2277
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
increased attack speed to all

2278
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
of your other skills when you

2279
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
had frenzy stacks.

2280
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Now you're going to be getting

2281
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
damage and attack speed.

2282
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
You know, we heard a lot of

2283
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
feedback from players that

2284
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
they would hit attack speed

2285
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
cap, and then this unique

2286
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
wasn't really doing very much

2287
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
for them.

2288
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
So now you're also just going

2289
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
to get damage in addition to

2290
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
making it easier to hit that

2291
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
cap for your other skills.

2292
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
So it's just, you know, more

2293
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
stats, stronger.

2294
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Next, Reign of the Ravenous.

2295
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
A couple things here.

2296
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
One is it's giving you skill

2297
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
ranks of Rend, which is

2298
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,000
pretty significant.

2299
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
And remember, that 2 to 3

2300
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
might not seem so significant,

2301
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
but when you greater affix that

2302
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
and then masterwork it, like,

2303
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
your potential of more damage

2304
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
on this goes up very

2305
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
significantly.

2306
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
We're also giving you skill

2307
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
ranks of brawling skills still.

2308
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
The thing to point out here is

2309
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
your Rend's duration, this will

2310
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
also just increase the

2311
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
throughput damage of it.

2312
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It has been doubled, so that's

2313
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
just more damage on Rend in

2314
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
addition to the skill ranks.

2315
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
And then also at the bottom,

2316
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
a small little detail, but

2317
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
before, you could only apply

2318
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
that special effect of your

2319
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
brawling skills applying your

2320
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Rend's bleed every 4 seconds,

2321
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
and now it's every second.

2322
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
So now if you're able to spam

2323
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
brawling skills, you're just

2324
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
going to be applying Rend

2325
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
bleeds to enemies and, you

2326
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
know, stronger Rend bleeds

2327
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
like crazy.

2328
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
So it's a pretty big power

2329
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
boost.

2330
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Next, the Fields of Crimson.

2331
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
The thing that we really want

2332
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
to call out here, I mean,

2333
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
there's a lot of things that

2334
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
are kind of unique and

2335
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
different, but is that one

2336
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
kind of rule that we had with

2337
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
item stats that we're now

2338
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
changing and breaking is we

2339
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
never really buffed the things

2340
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
like enhancements or like

2341
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
the AB, like the different

2342
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:13,000
choice upgrades that you

2343
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
could do for a skill.

2344
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
This one actually buffs

2345
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
enhanced ruptures explosion

2346
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,000
size.

2347
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:19,000
So, you know, normally when

2348
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
you rupture an enemy, it does

2349
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
that explosion.

2350
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
This will make that explosion

2351
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
be way bigger.

2352
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
So it's kind of a neat way

2353
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:25,000
that we can manipulate

2354
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
player power via stats.

2355
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Next, let's move on to the

2356
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Sorceress.

2357
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
So the Staff of Endless Rage,

2358
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:33,000
we actually have a combo

2359
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
here that we're going to show

2360
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
a little video of before and

2361
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
after with this.

2362
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Fireball builds.

2363
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
The Staff now does some,

2364
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
and the gloves would be

2365
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
doing some unique things to

2366
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Fireballs.

2367
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
One is Butt Plus Fireball

2368
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Projectile Speed.

2369
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:46,000
So this is actually going to

2370
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
make your Fireballs fly

2371
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
through the air faster or

2372
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
bounce quicker.

2373
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And so you'll be able to get

2374
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
through them and they'll,

2375
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,000
you know, finish their path

2376
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
faster.

2377
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
You've got the Temporing

2378
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Recipe now so it doesn't

2379
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
compete with your chance to

2380
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
cast twice.

2381
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
And you can see there it goes

2382
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
up to 75% just on that one

2383
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
stat.

2384
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
So it basically almost solves

2385
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
it for you by itself, which

2386
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
is pretty huge.

2387
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
You've got some massive skill

2388
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
ranks to Fireball.

2389
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
So now, again, way more

2390
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
multiplicative damage than

2391
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
before.

2392
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
And then, you know, you see

2393
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
at the bottom that the upper

2394
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
end of that damage is going

2395
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
up per the same as most of

2396
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,000
our Uniques.

2397
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And next is combos with the

2398
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Gloves of the Illuminator.

2399
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
A couple things to kind of

2400
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
gloat on here is the Fireball

2401
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Attack Speed is going up by a

2402
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
much bigger amount than other

2403
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
classes or than normal Attack

2404
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Speed.

2405
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Sorry, on other slots.

2406
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Also, you get Mana when

2407
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Fireball explodes.

2408
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I played with this build and I

2409
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
think it was Season 1 and I

2410
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
constantly ran into Mana

2411
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
issues because you always want

2412
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
to spam this as much as you

2413
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
can.

2414
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
So when you think of this

2415
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
stat, you know, you can

2416
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
greater this.

2417
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
You can masterwork this.

2418
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And you kind of combine this

2419
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
with the Attack Speed here and

2420
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,000
then you combine it with the

2421
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Projectile Speed.

2422
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Yeah, and you get a lot more

2423
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Fireballs.

2424
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Remember, it's every time that

2425
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
it explodes, which when it

2426
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
bounces, it's exploding.

2427
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Yeah.

2428
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And when you're splitting and

2429
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
getting more from multiple

2430
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
projectiles, you're getting more

2431
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
bounce explosions.

2432
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
So it's giving you a resource

2433
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,000
engine.

2434
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Yeah, you're essentially a

2435
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Fireball machine gun.

2436
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Yeah, so we've got a little

2437
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
bit of a Season 4 to Season 5

2438
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
comparison here of what it

2439
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,000
looks like.

2440
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
A little video.

2441
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
So in Season 4, you can see,

2442
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
you know, every third cast gives

2443
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
you three.

2444
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
But Season 5, you're going to

2445
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
randomly get three and then

2446
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
sometimes even more when it

2447
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
combines with the double

2448
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
projectile bonus.

2449
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
So you can actually really fill up

2450
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
your screen with Fireballs

2451
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
everywhere.

2452
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,000
And every one of those

2453
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
bounces is giving you mana

2454
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
back to cast more.

2455
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
That's ludicrous.

2456
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So it's pretty cool.

2457
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
It's its own little engine.

2458
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Next, we've got Blue Rose.

2459
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Probably the cool thing to

2460
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
point out here is there's

2461
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
a chance for Ice Spikes to

2462
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
explode twice.

2463
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
So this is also something that

2464
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
we haven't really done where

2465
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
we have these, we call them

2466
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
subpowers internally, but,

2467
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,000
you know, these things like

2468
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Dust Devils or Ice Spikes

2469
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
that are like powers that

2470
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
generate when you cast a skill

2471
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,000
that are usually through

2472
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Legendaries or Uniques.

2473
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
We generally don't manipulate

2474
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
them too heavily like this,

2475
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
but we're going to be

2476
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
experimenting more with that

2477
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
in unique stat affixes.

2478
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
So here, you know, your Ice

2479
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Spikes can actually like

2480
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
double proc, so they get,

2481
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
you know, double explosions

2482
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
and then any other things

2483
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
that would proc off that

2484
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
would be doubled, which is

2485
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:09,000
pretty neat.

2486
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Next, let's move on to the

2487
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Druid.

2488
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
So Waxing Gibbous, this is

2489
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
the Shred Druid unique.

2490
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
So what we did here that I want

2491
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
to point out, you know, in

2492
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
addition to the fact that

2493
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
you're getting a bunch of

2494
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
skill ranks to Shred and

2495
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Toxic's Claws, which is a

2496
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
bunch more multiplicative

2497
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
damage, so power level is

2498
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
going up significantly, is

2499
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Blood Howl grants stealth

2500
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
for a few seconds.

2501
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
So what's really cool about

2502
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
this is, you know, we

2503
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,000
basically added a new

2504
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
mechanic via a simple item

2505
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
stat in this unique, and it

2506
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
combines with the unique

2507
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:39,000
effect, right?

2508
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
So before on live, you know,

2509
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
you kill enemies with

2510
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Shred, you go into stealth,

2511
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:43,000
and then you come out and

2512
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
you guarantee crit.

2513
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
So as you're killing enemies

2514
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
over and over, you're just

2515
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
critting constantly as you go

2516
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:48,000
in and out of stealth.

2517
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
But you couldn't really do

2518
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
that against bosses, and you

2519
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
had no other ways to get

2520
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:51,000
into stealth.

2521
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But now we've created an

2522
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
alternative way where if you

2523
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
cast Blood Howl or get the

2524
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Blood Howl effect in other

2525
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
ways, you'll go into stealth

2526
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
and get this proc, and now

2527
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
you can get this, you know,

2528
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
against single bosses or in

2529
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
situations you couldn't

2530
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,000
before.

2531
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
So we've given you a

2532
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
potential way to create your

2533
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
own engine, which is pretty

2534
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
neat to get those infinite

2535
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,000
crits.

2536
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Next, Great Staff of the

2537
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Crone.

2538
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I believe we showed this one

2539
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
earlier to people, but I

2540
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
just wanted to point out, you

2541
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:15,000
know, what was special about

2542
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
this.

2543
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Stormstrike, chaining to

2544
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
additional targets, you know,

2545
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:19,000
things like this.

2546
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Again, it's a single stat that

2547
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
does something that kind of

2548
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
really changes how the

2549
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
unique works, right?

2550
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
You're going to get all the

2551
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
different procs and different

2552
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
effects by chaining to more

2553
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
enemies more often.

2554
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
You can also see here that the

2555
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
upper end of that damage that

2556
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
you could get is going up from

2557
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
150% to 200, so it's just

2558
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:35,000
better.

2559
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
And last but not least, we've

2560
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
got Storm's Companion.

2561
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
This one, I again, wanted to

2562
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
highlight another new thing that

2563
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
we're doing, and I want to

2564
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
call it here, is the Lucky Hit

2565
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Chance for the Pack Leader

2566
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Spirit Boon.

2567
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
So normally, we never really

2568
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,000
manipulate class mechanics, but

2569
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
here, you know, this Pack

2570
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Leader, this isn't like a

2571
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
passive or thing in the

2572
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:55,000
skill tree.

2573
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
This isn't the Spirit Boon,

2574
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
your class mechanic, and this

2575
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
increases that Lucky Hit

2576
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Chance to get a reset on the

2577
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:01,000
cooldowns of all your

2578
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
companion skills.

2579
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
So again, this is something

2580
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
that, you know, normally we

2581
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
don't get to manipulate, and

2582
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
now you'll be able to do, and

2583
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I think it'll be pretty cool.

2584
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
We have also decided that

2585
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Pack Leader is two words

2586
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
instead of one.

2587
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Yeah, yeah.

2588
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Everything's getting updated.

2589
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Yeah.

2590
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Everything.

2591
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Everything's up to me.

2592
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Everything's changing.

2593
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
All right, moving on to the

2594
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Rogue Eaglehorn.

2595
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Let me see, what did I want

2596
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
to, I think just pointing out

2597
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
here, this was about moving

2598
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
the Tempered Recipe.

2599
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,000
The Penetrating Shot

2600
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
projectiles can cast twice.

2601
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Again, another example of

2602
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:33,000
that.

2603
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
We're also giving you a bunch

2604
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
of skill ranks to

2605
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Penetrating Shot.

2606
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Again, this is a way that

2607
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
we're adding just like raw

2608
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
power and damage in ways that

2609
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
aren't in the unique effect.

2610
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
So these stats on these

2611
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
things can be very strong

2612
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,000
out the gate.

2613
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
And then again, tempering

2614
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
and masterworking just makes

2615
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
these go really, really high.

2616
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Next, Word of a Con.

2617
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
This one was a really silly,

2618
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
fun one that we liked.

2619
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
You see there, the one I want

2620
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
to point out, well, one is

2621
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
the ultimate damage.

2622
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Actually, ultimate skill damage

2623
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
for the Rogue is kind of a

2624
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
premium because they have

2625
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
that Paragon node that makes

2626
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
it turn into multiplicative

2627
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
damage for all your skills.

2628
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,000
So that's actually pretty

2629
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
meaty.

2630
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
It's also way higher value

2631
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:10,000
than normal.

2632
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Also, the chance for

2633
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Reign of Arrows waves

2634
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:13,000
to cast twice.

2635
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So normally we don't do,

2636
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
you know, chance to double

2637
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
cast on ultimates, but again,

2638
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
uniques get to break the

2639
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,000
rules.

2640
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
So now you've got, you know,

2641
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,000
juiced up Reign of Arrows

2642
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
cooldown reduction.

2643
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
They can cast twice and they

2644
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
hit way harder on the Reign of

2645
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Arrows themed unique.

2646
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
So again, really trying to

2647
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
bring out the theme and the

2648
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
fantasy of these uniques in

2649
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
the stats, in the effects, to

2650
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
really create something

2651
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
special.

2652
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
And next, Saboteur Signet.

2653
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I was running this in Season

2654
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:40,000
4.

2655
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I'm a little sad that I'm

2656
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
going to be doing something

2657
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
else in Season 5, but I

2658
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
loved my stun grenade build.

2659
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
But here you can see a bunch

2660
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
of grenade damage, obvious

2661
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
theme for the grenade build.

2662
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
We're also giving you a lot

2663
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
of your stun grenade size

2664
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:51,000
here.

2665
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
And then again, a new affix

2666
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
that kind of creates your

2667
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
own engine.

2668
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You're getting plus one energy

2669
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
when a stun grenade explodes.

2670
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
And this is each individual

2671
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
grenade, right?

2672
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,000
So you usually release a

2673
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
cluster of these things.

2674
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
So now, again, I spent a lot

2675
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
of my time in Season 4 trying

2676
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
to solve resource and get ways

2677
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
to cast this a lot, to

2678
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
throw out those stun grenades,

2679
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
and now this kind of helps

2680
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
its own engine.

2681
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Also, one thing to point out

2682
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
here is that it's no longer

2683
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
just a flurry unique.

2684
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It's casting a core skill

2685
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
through a stun grenade.

2686
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
So it's a lot more

2687
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
generically applicable.

2688
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
You can use this with, you

2689
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
know, all the different

2690
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
core skills, not just flurry.

2691
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Next, Necromancer.

2692
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
The big one I wanted to

2693
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
point out here, we're going

2694
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
to be showing both of the

2695
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Blood Surge uniques and how

2696
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
they've been updated and they

2697
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:33,000
combo with each other.

2698
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
We have a stat here that

2699
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Blood Surge drains more

2700
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
times from elites.

2701
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
So to be clear, this is the

2702
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
drain, not the explosion.

2703
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
But the drain does feed into

2704
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
the explosion damage and

2705
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
there's a lot of, like,

2706
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
synergy and things based on

2707
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:46,000
draining enemies.

2708
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
So now, you know, one of the

2709
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
problems that Blood Surge has

2710
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
always had is when you're

2711
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
fighting a single target or a

2712
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
boss, you know, you only

2713
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
drain one enemy and then

2714
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
you're not getting your, like,

2715
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
explosion damage up.

2716
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
But now you're going to be

2717
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
draining multiple times from

2718
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
those elites, so you're

2719
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
getting, you know, more life

2720
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
back and other procs when you

2721
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
drain, but also your explosion

2722
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
will be more significant now

2723
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
against them.

2724
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Next, Death Speaker's

2725
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Pendant.

2726
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
This is the other Blood Surge

2727
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:10,000
unique.

2728
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
We also added another thing

2729
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:13,000
that combines with the other

2730
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
unique where you're getting

2731
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
essence per enemy drained,

2732
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:16,000
right?

2733
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
And so now, as you drain

2734
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
enemies for the explosion,

2735
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,000
you're going to be getting

2736
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
more essence back to cast the

2737
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
skill and spam it more.

2738
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
We're also giving you a bunch

2739
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
of ranks to Blood Surge,

2740
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
which, you know, just makes

2741
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:26,000
sense.

2742
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
So, you know, 50% before

2743
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Masterworking and Temporing

2744
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
multiplicative damage is

2745
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
already a giant buff to this.

2746
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
But then also you can see

2747
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,000
that, you know, the numbers

2748
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
also went up on this as well.

2749
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
So it's just going to be

2750
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
going to be pretty significant.

2751
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Can't wait.

2752
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
And last but not least,

2753
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Greaves of the Empty Tomb.

2754
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
This is your Sever unique.

2755
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Lots of stuff to point out

2756
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:47,000
here.

2757
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
One is you have multiple

2758
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
inherents.

2759
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
So, you know, normally you can

2760
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
only get three max of eight

2761
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:52,000
charges.

2762
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
You get more here.

2763
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
We also had a fun little thing

2764
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
where you're evade now

2765
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
these behind Desecrated

2766
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Ground because this is the

2767
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Desecrated Ground unique.

2768
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
We also have chance for

2769
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Sever projectiles to cast

2770
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:02,000
twice.

2771
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
We have Sever size here.

2772
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
We also give you ranks to

2773
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Reaper's Pursuit.

2774
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
So this is really about just

2775
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
like moving and grooving,

2776
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,000
like going around.

2777
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
One thing I want to point out

2778
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
here as well is this new

2779
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
aspect of Creeping Mist that

2780
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
came in.

2781
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
And you can combine this with

2782
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
the Greaves of the Empty

2783
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Tomb.

2784
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
So this new aspect, you know,

2785
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
we heard that Necro players

2786
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
want mobility and boy did we

2787
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
give you mobility.

2788
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
So what this does is when

2789
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
you evade during, first of

2790
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:28,000
all, you get evade cooldown

2791
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
reduction, so you evade more.

2792
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
But when you evade during

2793
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Blood Mist, you travel twice

2794
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
as far.

2795
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
And both when you enter and

2796
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
exit Blood Mist, it resects

2797
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
your evade cooldown.

2798
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And one of the things that

2799
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
makes this crazy where we

2800
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
might actually be crazy, and

2801
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I hope we don't have to

2802
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
revisit this, but we're going

2803
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
to see, is that that reset

2804
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
of your evade cooldown counts

2805
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
for all of your charges of

2806
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
evade.

2807
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
So what this means is, and we

2808
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
have a video, is that you can

2809
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
evade five times, then evade

2810
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
in Blood Mist, and then

2811
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
evade five more times.

2812
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
So see here, then you're

2813
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
evading in Blood Mist, and

2814
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
you're leaving behind that

2815
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
desecrated ground everywhere.

2816
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Just skating around, you

2817
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:03,000
know?

2818
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Yep.

2819
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
It's like an ice skating

2820
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,000
ring.

2821
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
So every time you cast Blood

2822
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Mist, you're going to be

2823
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
getting ten evades.

2824
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
It's silly and hilarious.

2825
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
But we're putting it in the

2826
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
game, and I hope we don't

2827
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
regret it.

2828
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Necros are going to be

2829
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,000
zooming.

2830
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Yep, they're going to be

2831
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
zooming with this.

2832
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Wow.

2833
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Yeah, so that's kind of our

2834
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
preview of our uniques, and

2835
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:21,000
kind of what's coming into

2836
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
the game.

2837
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Again, we're pretty excited

2838
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:23,000
about it.

2839
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I think this will be pretty

2840
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:24,000
cool.

2841
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Yeah.

2842
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
But yeah.

2843
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Professor Adam Jackson, take

2844
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:27,000
a bow.

2845
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
That is incredible.

2846
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And again, that's not even

2847
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:30,000
everything.

2848
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
There's a lot of stuff going

2849
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
to other uniques that are at

2850
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
that level.

2851
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Patch notes, after the stream,

2852
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
we will be showing a

2853
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
comparison of every single

2854
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
unique, and their changes

2855
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
from season four to season

2856
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
five.

2857
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
So you can go in there and

2858
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,000
check out all those

2859
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
changes.

2860
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
But that was a great, great

2861
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
overview of all those

2862
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
changes.

2863
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
That is really, really

2864
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:45,000
exciting.

2865
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
This brings us to our Q&A

2866
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
portion of the show.

2867
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Let's all shift our legs at

2868
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:51,000
the same time.

2869
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Yeah, yeah.

2870
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
So we've been following

2871
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
along in Twitch chat, and

2872
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
we've picked out a bunch of

2873
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
questions, and we're going

2874
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
to kick it off, tossing it

2875
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
over to Mr. Dan Tangway.

2876
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
How do reward choices work

2877
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
in multiplayer parties for

2878
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Infernal Hordes?

2879
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Does the leader choose the

2880
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
reward for everyone, or can

2881
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
each player choose?

2882
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
All right.

2883
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
So yeah, let's talk about

2884
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
this.

2885
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
In the Infernal Hordes, when

2886
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:14,000
you're collecting burning

2887
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
ether, each individual

2888
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
collects their own burning

2889
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:19,000
ether.

2890
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
And we did this for the

2891
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
very reason that you're

2892
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
asking questions about.

2893
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
We wanted players to be

2894
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
able to go in and choose

2895
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
the rewards that they want

2896
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
to choose, not necessarily

2897
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
what somebody else gets to

2898
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
first or what the party

2899
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
leader wants.

2900
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
So every individual party

2901
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
member will have their own

2902
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
choice of rewards.

2903
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Awesome.

2904
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Awesome.

2905
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Thanks for letting us know.

2906
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Marcus, you've got to read

2907
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
the names.

2908
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Oh my goodness.

2909
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Did I not say Eldrick?

2910
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Oh my gosh.

2911
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Eldrick, I won't forget you.

2912
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Thank you, Adam.

2913
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Eldrick, thank you for that

2914
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:48,000
question.

2915
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Of course, you're going to be

2916
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
a stickler for that.

2917
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Yeah, no.

2918
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
It's a great thing to call

2919
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,000
out.

2920
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Pull the ladder behind you.

2921
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Because our next question is

2922
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
from Dartless.

2923
01:46:59,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Actually, I think we have a

2924
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
question here on the lower

2925
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
third, which is this one.

2926
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
We've gotten a lot of these

2927
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
questions, so I do want to

2928
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,000
actually address this one.

2929
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:08,000
This is, when are we going

2930
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
to hear more about Vessel of

2931
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Hatred?

2932
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Because we just had the

2933
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Spiritborn reveal.

2934
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
We showed off the Spiritborn.

2935
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I will note that we also are

2936
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,000
going to be at Gamescom.

2937
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
There's actually some Gamescom

2938
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
news that came out this

2939
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:19,000
morning.

2940
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
The Spiritborn will be

2941
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
playable at Gamescom.

2942
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
If you go to the Xbox booth,

2943
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
you'll be able to play it

2944
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,000
there.

2945
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
So if you're attending that

2946
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,000
show, it'll be really

2947
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,000
awesome.

2948
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,000
There's actually going to be

2949
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
more news coming out at that

2950
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
time, so of course, tune in.

2951
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And I will say, you guys have

2952
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
only heard a very small

2953
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
fraction of what's coming out

2954
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
of Vessel of Hatred.

2955
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
So we're really excited for

2956
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Gamescom.

2957
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
So you guys will hear more

2958
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
then, so stay tuned.

2959
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Yeah.

2960
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Grab your tickets and come to

2961
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Gamescom because we'll be

2962
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:48,000
there.

2963
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I'll be super-sup.

2964
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Yes, exactly.

2965
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Go to Germany.

2966
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Go to Germany.

2967
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Come to Cologne.

2968
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Come to Cologne.

2969
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
There was some people

2970
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
confused in chat.

2971
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:57,000
This is a question from

2972
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Dartless who was saying,

2973
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
we can temper uniques now.

2974
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Did I mishear that?

2975
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Maybe that was a mistake

2976
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
being said.

2977
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:03,000
So Adam, if you want to

2978
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
speak to that.

2979
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Yeah, 100% clear.

2980
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Cannot temper uniques.

2981
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
We want them to be different in

2982
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
that they do not engage with

2983
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
that system, at least for now.

2984
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
But no, you're going to be,

2985
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
what I wanted to say or be

2986
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
clarifying is that you can get

2987
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
tempering affixes on uniques.

2988
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Like they'll just drop with

2989
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
those affixes or whatever.

2990
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
But you can't like go to the

2991
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
to the box with them,

2992
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
manipulate them in that way.

2993
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
You can't temper them.

2994
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Gotcha.

2995
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Cool.

2996
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Cool.

2997
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Thanks for clarifying that.

2998
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
It's really unique.

2999
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Adam.

3000
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
It'sDafi has a question for

3001
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Dantangue.

3002
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Are there any plans to continue

3003
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
iterating on the Infernal

3004
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Hordes in the future since it's

3005
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
a permanent addition?

3006
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Are there going to be more

3007
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
boons and banes coming?

3008
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Yeah, that's a great question.

3009
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
And yeah, just to reiterate what

3010
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
you had pointed out there,

3011
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
this is an Eternal Realm feature

3012
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
that's going to appear in the game

3013
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:55,000
forevermore.

3014
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
And so this is just the first

3015
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:58,000
version of it.

3016
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I mean, you think back to what

3017
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Helltide was in the base game

3018
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
and how we've iterated on that

3019
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
over time to get it to where it

3020
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,000
is.

3021
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
We're going to continue investing

3022
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
similar levels of effort into the

3023
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Infernal Hordes too.

3024
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
And so boons and banes is

3025
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
something we heard a lot about

3026
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
feedback during the PTR.

3027
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And so we absolutely want to make

3028
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
more improvements to the boons and

3029
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:23,000
banes.

3030
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
And so stay tuned.

3031
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
That's not going to hit in Season 5,

3032
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
but we'll figure out where we can

3033
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
get it in in future seasons.

3034
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Awesome.

3035
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Great to hear that we're going to

3036
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
continue tinkering on that feature

3037
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
in the seasons to come.

3038
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I've got a really interesting

3039
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
question from Mano underscore Imp

3040
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
with regards to those...

3041
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Mano Imp.

3042
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:43,000
We know Mano Imp.

3043
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
With regards to the damage increase

3044
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
per class resource.

3045
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Sure.

3046
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
They're asking, is the Spirit Boring

3047
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
getting 1% damage at 7 points if it's

3048
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
their main stat just because they have

3049
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
a lower amount of weapons?

3050
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Yeah.

3051
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:55,000
TBD.

3052
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:56,000
TBD.

3053
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I don't want to go on a map on

3054
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Spirit Born yet, but they'll be

3055
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
getting similar treatment to all the

3056
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:02,000
other stuff.

3057
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
All of this is kind of evergreen.

3058
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Awesome.

3059
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Awesome.

3060
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Lukewee.

3061
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Lukewee.

3062
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
When will we see the overhaul of the

3063
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Paragon system?

3064
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Would you consider removing the

3065
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Paragon limit?

3066
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
There are going to be changes to

3067
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Paragon, but we aren't talking about

3068
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
those changes yet.

3069
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Awesome.

3070
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Yeah.

3071
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Awesome.

3072
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
TBD.

3073
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:26,000
TBD.

3074
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
TBD.

3075
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Stay tuned.

3076
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Love this name.

3077
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Chickenwing929.

3078
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Love it.

3079
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Can the reputation rewards for Season of

3080
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
the Infernal Hordes be earned on only

3081
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
one character or all your seasonal

3082
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:39,000
characters?

3083
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I believe it's all characters,

3084
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
similar to what we have for Season 4.

3085
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
So you can actually go back in and just

3086
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
play like, go through the reputation

3087
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
board and then get another

3088
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Resplendent Spark.

3089
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
That's really the question.

3090
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Really, that's truly the question.

3091
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Yeah, so you can get additional.

3092
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Pretty sure it's character specific.

3093
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:01,000
So you can, yeah.

3094
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Nice.

3095
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Systematic5k, Adam Jackson.

3096
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Will our existing uniques be updated with

3097
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
these new unique changes?

3098
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Yeah, we get this every round that we

3099
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
update them.

3100
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
It's the same rules as always, which is

3101
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
the unique power, when we update that,

3102
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
is your existing uniques will get that,

3103
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:21,000
right?

3104
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
So when we increase your damage range or

3105
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,000
whatever, that's going to get.

3106
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,000
But the stats, those are going to be

3107
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
legacy on any items that exist.

3108
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
So you're going to have to re-farm your

3109
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
unique to get the new stats that are on

3110
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:31,000
them.

3111
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Awesome.

3112
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
And that's kind of the way that they're

3113
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
going to work going forward, unless you say

3114
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
otherwise.

3115
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Yeah.

3116
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
It's just how things work under the hood

3117
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
for when we do changes on them.

3118
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Yeah.

3119
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Nice.

3120
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Pudge, Pudge underscore BP.

3121
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Are there any plans for clan rework

3122
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
slash improvements?

3123
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
There are, I know there are some changes

3124
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
coming for some social features.

3125
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
We're just not ready to talk about them

3126
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
now.

3127
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
But you guys will hear about them soon.

3128
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Awesome.

3129
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Awesome.

3130
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
This one's kind of a design philosophy

3131
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
question for Adam Jackson.

3132
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Sure.

3133
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Evans423 wants to know, how future-proof

3134
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
is the system of static uniques when

3135
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
adding new slash better tempering effects

3136
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
and new content?

3137
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
How future-proof are static uniques when

3138
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
adding new tempers?

3139
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Let me think.

3140
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Semi, right?

3141
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Because I think it is something where if

3142
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
we add new tempers or new affixes or

3143
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
whatever, we will probably need to go

3144
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
back and update uniques that we wanted

3145
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
to apply to and make it work again.

3146
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Our hope is that these uniques are going

3147
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
to be pretty future-proof.

3148
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
They're going to be very meaty in the

3149
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
amount of power that they give you.

3150
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
They're also extremely thematic.

3151
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
But I think we do reserve the right,

3152
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
like, hey, if we find a new idea for

3153
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
existing passive or existing tempering

3154
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
that is introduced to the game and we

3155
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
want to put it on, we can do that.

3156
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I will say also one thing that we want

3157
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
to do more is, like, just come up with

3158
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
really crazy new ones that aren't even

3159
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
really tempering recipes, but just,

3160
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
like, crazy effects, right?

3161
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Like Blood Howl grants stealth or you

3162
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
drain more with your, you know, Blood

3163
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Search, stuff like that.

3164
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
So I would expect we'll probably be

3165
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
updating them as we go forward.

3166
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Not probably as dramatically as this

3167
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
all at once, but I foresee this

3168
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
probably likely, yeah.

3169
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Nice, yeah.

3170
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Always tinkering, always updating.

3171
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Speaking of which, about tempering,

3172
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
one thing that we forgot to mention,

3173
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
and I know we mentioned it at the

3174
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
PTR stream last time.

3175
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I'm sorry, my earpiece just keeps

3176
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:27,000
falling off.

3177
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
It looks like I'm, like, scratching my

3178
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
ear, but I'm not.

3179
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
The greater, I know there was a lot

3180
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
of, like, feedback after season four

3181
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
regarding tempering and potentially

3182
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
bricking items.

3183
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
And one update that we talked about

3184
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
during the PTR stream, and I want to

3185
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
mention it wasn't in PTR, but is in

3186
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
season five specifically, is greater

3187
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
affixes will actually get additional

3188
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
temper rerolls on them based on the

3189
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
greater affix, you know, quality of

3190
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
what they are.

3191
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
So for, like, greater affix one star

3192
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
ones, you'll end up getting one

3193
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
additional temper reroll.

3194
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
And then it grows by how many stars

3195
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
that there are.

3196
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So that is going in season five.

3197
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
So we mentioned it last stream.

3198
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I just wanted to reiterate it because

3199
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I actually forgot we should have

3200
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:14,000
mentioned it.

3201
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Yeah, sweet.

3202
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Yeah, great to mention that, Adam.

3203
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:17,000
That's awesome.

3204
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
We've got an easy one here from

3205
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,000
ZWeapons.

3206
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
What is a Mythic unique?

3207
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
There was a purple item during the

3208
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:25,000
stream?

3209
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Yeah, you can tune into our last

3210
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:28,000
stream for it.

3211
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
But yeah, basically what was Uber

3212
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Uniques is what people call them.

3213
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
It's basically, like, you know, the

3214
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
really best items in the game that

3215
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
have, like, perfect stats and

3216
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:37,000
everything.

3217
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
We rebranded them to Mythic Uniques.

3218
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
They now have their own special

3219
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
color, special beam when they

3220
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
drop.

3221
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
They just got to hold treatment to

3222
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
really make them feel like the

3223
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
penultimate items that they are in

3224
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:47,000
the game.

3225
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Yeah.

3226
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Yeah.

3227
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:48,000
That's awesome.

3228
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Sophie0257, are they going to make

3229
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
it so that we can pre-download the

3230
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
update or will it be available only

3231
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:56,000
on the 6th?

3232
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
That's a great question.

3233
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:58,000
That's a good question.

3234
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Based off feedback from season

3235
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
four's launch, the patch will be

3236
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
available to download roughly an

3237
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
hour before Season of the Infernal

3238
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Hordes launches.

3239
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
So that season goes live at 10 a.m.

3240
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
and roughly an hour before you'll be

3241
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
able to pre-download the patch to get

3242
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
in the game and get ready for the

3243
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,000
season.

3244
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Yeah.

3245
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I know a lot of people are probably

3246
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
going, like, why not multiple days

3247
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
and things like that.

3248
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,000
We're getting there.

3249
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:17,000
We're trying.

3250
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
But no, it's, it's, it's, we got a

3251
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
lot of feedback about, you know, how

3252
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
things started immediately on the,

3253
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
like, you could download and actually

3254
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
start the season.

3255
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Of course, we want to make sure that

3256
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
people can be as prepared as

3257
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:29,000
possible.

3258
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
So one hour before the actual season

3259
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
starts, like, you should be able to

3260
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
actually download and get that all

3261
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:35,000
prepared.

3262
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
So, like, as soon as the season, the

3263
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
time for the season begin, which is

3264
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
roughly, like, 10 a.m. Pacific on the

3265
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
day of, you, you can just jump in

3266
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
without needing to download.

3267
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Yeah.

3268
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Yeah.

3269
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Skull MTV.

3270
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Hey, great job.

3271
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Thanks.

3272
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Any plans to rework master working in

3273
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:55,000
brackets?

3274
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Higher cost, but, you know, you can

3275
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
choose upgrades and tempering to make

3276
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
these systems have less RNG?

3277
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Nothing to announce at this time.

3278
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
We definitely have heard the feedback.

3279
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
We are starting with the first step of,

3280
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
like, you know, one of the things that

3281
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
we know feels really bad for players,

3282
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
like, I got a, how do I say?

3283
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
The more greater affixes you have on an

3284
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
item, the higher stress and investment

3285
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
you have to, like, make it work the way

3286
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
that you want.

3287
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
So we are relaxing that, make it a

3288
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:20,000
little bit easier.

3289
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Another thing that we're thinking about

3290
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
that's a little lighter is, like, the

3291
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
tempering recipes, making them have,

3292
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
like, three on average instead of four

3293
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
or more.

3294
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Something that we're talking about

3295
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
moving towards, but nothing, like, of

3296
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
overhauling the system and doing a

3297
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,000
major change at this time that we

3298
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
have to announce.

3299
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Cool.

3300
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Thanks, Adam.

3301
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Dan Tangway from Holy Smokes.

3302
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Their name isn't for Holy Smokes.

3303
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Their name is...

3304
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I thought it was Dan Tangway asking a

3305
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
question, and I was like, wait, what?

3306
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,000
No, no, no.

3307
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Their name is Frodo Bolson.

3308
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Frodo Bolson.

3309
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
But all the O's are zeroes.

3310
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:54,000
All right.

3311
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
How does the Infernal Hordes work in

3312
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:57,000
groups?

3313
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Do you need only one compass per group?

3314
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
So the Infernal Hordes, you only need

3315
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
one compass per group in order to be

3316
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:06,000
able to get in.

3317
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Yeah.

3318
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Sweet.

3319
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Just like Nightmare Dungeon sigils.

3320
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Awesome.

3321
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:12,000
All right.

3322
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Revask.

3323
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Any news on reworked Nightmare Dungeons?

3324
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Nothing.

3325
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Nothing for today.

3326
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Nothing to announce today.

3327
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Yeah, nothing to announce today.

3328
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Sweet.

3329
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Green Zombie Studios.

3330
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Can we expect cool new transmogs in

3331
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Season 5 from salvaging items?

3332
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I am not sure.

3333
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I know, like, the Season 5 does have

3334
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
over...

3335
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
has a lot of new legendary aspects and

3336
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
uniques.

3337
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Like, there's, like, 50 new legendary

3338
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
aspects and uniques being added into

3339
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Season 5.

3340
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
So there's a lot of, like, more the

3341
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
back-end type of stuff that affects

3342
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
more so on the gameplay.

3343
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
But I'm not exactly sure if there's a

3344
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
ton coming in.

3345
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Yeah.

3346
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
So we can, actually.

3347
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
There are a couple of new uniques in

3348
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Hell that you can earn that will have

3349
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
all new looks to them that you can sell

3350
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
the gems and use in the cosmetic.

3351
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Yep.

3352
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Bam.

3353
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:08,000
There you go.

3354
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Dan, the savior from Albany.

3355
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
There you go.

3356
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Frodo Bolson.

3357
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Hot pancakes.

3358
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Are there still plans for rare and magic

3359
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,000
items?

3360
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I guess in terms of, like, a rework or

3361
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
changing their functionality in any way?

3362
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Yeah.

3363
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,000
I'd say nothing to announce today for that.

3364
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Yeah.

3365
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Cool.

3366
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Nice.

3367
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
All right.

3368
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Checking through.

3369
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Mac and D's.

3370
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Can we expect skill trees or support

3371
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
gems to change the way skills work?

3372
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Can we expect skill trees or support

3373
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
gems to change the way the skill works?

3374
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
I mean, we're not doing any skill tree

3375
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
overhaul right now in Season 5.

3376
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
I do think we have talked a bit on the

3377
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
team about having a desire of the

3378
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
upgrades for skills being, like, more

3379
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
impactful and really impactful.

3380
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Nothing to announce today, but it is

3381
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
something that is on our radar and I

3382
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
think is cool.

3383
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
I think one example that we talk about

3384
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
along the team is, like, the kick

3385
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
upgrade for the Barbarian, where

3386
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,000
normally, you know, when we were

3387
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
originally designing kick, it was this

3388
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
idea that you have this, like, skill

3389
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
where you hit an enemy and you care about

3390
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
the geometry of the place around you and you

3391
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
want to hit them into the wall and then

3392
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
they get knocked down, take a bunch of

3393
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
damage and all this stuff.

3394
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
That part hasn't really played out, I

3395
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
think, as well because the pace of our

3396
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
game is so fast.

3397
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
But one of the upgrades for kick,

3398
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
especially I remember in the early beta,

3399
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
like, way before, maybe it was alpha

3400
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
even, kick, you know, it converts kick

3401
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
from this cooldown-based geometry skill

3402
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
into just a powerhouse where it just

3403
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
spends all your resource and does a

3404
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
buttload of damage to an enemy.

3405
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,000
And it was, like, one-shotting world

3406
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000
bosses and stuff back then.

3407
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Like, it was hilarious.

3408
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I think I remember that.

3409
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
But the skill still has that upgrade.

3410
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
But I reference that upgrade a lot

3411
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
because I think it's really cool when

3412
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
you can convert a skill to, like,

3413
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
used to be cooldown and now isn't or

3414
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
used to be about this utility and now

3415
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
it's just damage or vice versa where it,

3416
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
like, really changes what a skill does.

3417
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
We think it's really cool.

3418
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
It definitely would be a lot of work to,

3419
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
like, do that to every skill.

3420
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
But I think it's something that's worth

3421
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
talking about and pursuing.

3422
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
So it is on our radar of something to do

3423
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
but nothing to announce today for it.

3424
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Awesome.

3425
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
That's really cool.

3426
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Thanks, Adam.

3427
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
And that brings us to the end of our Q&A.

3428
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
So I want to give a huge thank you to Adam and Adam

3429
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
and Dan for answering all those questions.

3430
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Adam squared.

3431
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Adam squared.

3432
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Back in action.

3433
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Hey, just like the PTR stream.

3434
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:21,000
You guys are back.

3435
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
There you go.

3436
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Screw those Joes.

3437
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Got them.

3438
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Yeah.

3439
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I'm just kidding.

3440
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
And that brings us to the end of our

3441
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Season of the Infernal Hordes developer update stream.

3442
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Just a few notes before we close out the stream.

3443
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Just want to take a moment to thank everyone

3444
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
for tuning into our Spiritborn showcase

3445
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
a few weeks back.

3446
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Yeah.

3447
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
It was really cool to show off that new class.

3448
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,000
It was such a huge moment for the team.

3449
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
So I really want to thank you all

3450
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
for coming to check that out.

3451
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
And if you want to play the Spiritborn in person,

3452
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
as Adam mentioned earlier,

3453
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
we are going to be at Gamescom.

3454
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
So get your tickets.

3455
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Come to Gamescom in Cologne, Germany.

3456
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
And...

3457
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I just went up through the roof.

3458
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
But speaking of Spiritborn,

3459
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,000
you can pre-purchase Vessel of Hatred today

3460
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
and instantly...

3461
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Oh, can they hear audio?

3462
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Oh, can everybody hear us?

3463
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Twitch chat?

3464
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Where did the sound go?

3465
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Okay, we're good now.

3466
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:25,000
We're good now.

3467
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Okay, awesome.

3468
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:26,000
All right.

3469
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Thank you, chat, for keeping us up to date.

3470
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Speaking of the Spiritborn,

3471
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000

3472
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,000

3473
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000

3474
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000

3475
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000

3477
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000

3478
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000

3479
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000

3480
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
The patch will be available for pre-download

3481
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
about an hour before the season goes live

3482
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
so you can get in and get ready for the season to start.

3483
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
The 150 patch notes are going to go live

3484
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000

3485

3487

You can see all the uniques and everything.

3488
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Yeah, check out those GIFs.

3489
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
They're pretty spiffy.

3490
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Team worked pretty hard on those.

3491
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
We also had the Season of the Infernal Hordes

3492
