I'm going to go to the next one.

449
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm going to go to the next one.

450
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We have to wait beyond my expectation.

451
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's like nothing that we had in D4.

452
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Pure hatred.

453
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They're Mifisto's army.

454
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They're one of them to feel a little bit more different from your typical demon family.

455
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Everyone's quality was top notch.

456
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But at the time, we didn't know if it was going to work.

457
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I think what we landed is going to turn some heads.

458
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This is not your normal thing.

459
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's the living form of hatred.

460
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The new monster class that we can introduce, they're called Hallows.

461
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
These Hallows have actually been around for like millennia.

462
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Mephisto at some point did go to Nahanthu a long, long, long time ago, and these Hallows

463
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:51,000
were a reaction of Mephisto being in Nahanthu at the time, and then they went dormant.

464
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Singing Mephisto in the Soul Stone seems like the right thing to do for Neyrael, but it

465
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
has a chain reaction that I don't think anybody was prepared for.

466
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The Hallows are really rife throughout Nahanthu, now that Mephisto is back and just visually

467
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
like horribly discussed and sort of made up of the things that have been consumed by

468
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
the Hallows.

469
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, they're an extension of evil, infecting wildlife and other monsters and people with

470
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
this thing called Icar, and they're just sort of going mad.

471
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:40,000
When we're designing the Hallows, the main thing that we wanted to push was just if hatred

472
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
came to life, what would it look like?

473
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So we're thinking this black goo that's kind of like formless, but also have this red

474
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
anger energy inside of it.

475
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And then with concept, we just want to make cool monsters.

476
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What if it's three legs, what if it's no legs, what if it has like three arms?

477
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So we pushed a lot of like options and exploration, and then from then on, like everyone from

478
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
narrative to design and concept we talk about is like, okay, we like this one and then

479
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
we can push it and move further.

480
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The Hallows family is made up of four members, the swarmer, the spitter, the caster, and the

481
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
boots.

482
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The big thing for me was that the family need to be overwhelming without just relying

483
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
on pure numbers.

484
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So they're going to get stronger over time if you let them fester.

485
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
They're their hatred after all.

486
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The swarmer can teleport and attack you from behind, from the sides, the spitter, there's

487
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
a slug with legs.

488
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
They spew out this monitor of goo.

489
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The root is the big hulking slow guy of the family.

490
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He has the shields that's buffing and making the rest of the army stronger.

491
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The caster is responsible for creating new swarmers.

492
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They also will channel onto a specific hollow and view them with an extra feature, make

493
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
some stronger and more deadly.

494
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The hollow caster's role serve as an elegant, hovering, yet menacing, dinging cacto in

495
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
again, really informed many of our design ideas.

496
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We want to make a new variant.

497
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We want to know in which specific area we would go into see that character or creature.

498
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Readability is like the main focus.

499
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
When through several iterations, the design, the textures, the materials, and the camera

500
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
testing.

501
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The day after she gave me like, what was the 10 different variations of the game?

502
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Don't be off talking.

503
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The emission on the spikes really did an awesome job to both on the Citibat and also

504
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
to improve the readability.

505
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
In any way, have the version that way were both happy ways and handy over to the tech

506
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
artists.

507
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We had some really strong narrative direction in understanding how big of a role hatred

508
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
played.

509
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And we knew that we needed one look to tie it all together.

510
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This hatred has one source and it's all about mefisto.

511
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
For the hollow specifically, we identified that we wanted to do some special work with

512
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
the materials, with the shaders for those characters.

513
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The colors are the code that runs on the GPU that takes in all sorts of inputs like textures

514
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and lighting and position and outputs what the object's surface is supposed to look like.

515
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We wanted a shader that was capable of adding the sludge layer, this hatred layer over top

516
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
of it and making it dynamic and animating so that it really looks like it was constantly

517
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
undulating or writhing.

518
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So once we had this shader function, we were able to kind of apply that in all these different

519
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
contexts like the monsters, like the environment, the character armors even.

520
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Most of the shader work was done by Alex who really took that shader function and made

521
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
it work in all sorts of different contexts.

522
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And we also have the hatred addons to these characters, these tentacles, these writhing

523
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
hatred, growths all over them, which was a procedurally generated process that was

524
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
largely run by sky on our team.

525
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The hollows boss was kind of born of this idea of what does a pinnacle hollows really

526
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
look like.

527
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We have the hollows family and that was pretty well defined by the time that the hollows

528
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
boss kind of came up with concepting.

529
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Our artist Victor had a lot of cool ideas for core themes and really wanted to push visuals

530
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
with contortions and like breaking the neck of this monster all over the place.

531
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's where we had the option to go like can we push it and really get that idea of what

532
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
hatred and the hollows are all about.

533
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It was a stinky black hiker that latched on to a once powerful spellcaster.

534
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It was such a great source of power that this particular hollows monster turned into

535
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
the precess of hatred.

536
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm Victor Lee, a principal concept artist on the Diablo team and I concepted the precess

537
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
of hatred.

538
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Victor Lee is one of the OGs from Diablo and he's known for creating a lot of dark imagery

539
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and every time we want to have a monster boss he's done all the greats even Diablo himself.

540
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
One of his monitors on the side of his desk is just like a dark black eye staring at him

541
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
and so when we needed something that's pure darkness like we had to tap Victor.

542
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I feel like when we're talking about hatred I kind of imagine visualise it as like a black

543
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
webby like thing so I thought a spider configuration would work for this.

544
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So I did a few variations some with souls, human souls trapped in the abdomen it's like

545
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
a purgatory because this creature consumes humans.

546
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I have this nagging feeling for a long time that why I felt it's not working no matter

547
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
how interesting the design is.

548
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm not pushing the boundaries so I basically rethought the whole thing.

549
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
A lot of our creatures are just like raw aggression this is musely and just brutal.

550
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Maybe this one is more insidious.

551
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What if the human figure is not controlling the hatred but it's the other way around.

552
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Like the hatred is actually marking humanity it's like dragging a puppet around.

553
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So what I did is I kept the human figure as a focal point but the rest of the creature

554
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
is this moving mass of basically a ball of hatred.

555
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It broke a lot of rules but I felt I just felt like this just fits so I went ahead with

556
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,000
it and rendered it out.

557
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I was looking at the concept for the first time with the designer on the feature Charles

558
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and we were kind of in the stunned silence for a little bit because it was this reaction

559
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
of this thing is so cool and then we started thinking how are we even going to make this

560
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
thing move?

561
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Typically our monsters are bipedal or their quadrupeds.

562
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
How is it going to move?

563
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We can't rely on walk cycles anymore.

564
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
How is it going to rotate?

565
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
We can't rely on the built in rotation stuff without looking weird as hell.

566
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It was clear that in order to make this like animate and look natural we were going to

567
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
have to pretty much dive into uncharted territory.

568
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
We wanted it to move in a very unique way.

569
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
We wanted it to summer solve through the air and be super unpredictable and zippy and

570
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
just have like ridiculous animations as those tentacles are flying all over the place.

571
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We had that narrative and kind of drive to make it formless and with our conventional rigging

572
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
that we can do that.

573
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We were doing prototyping before the feature even kicked off like we were already meeting

574
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
with animation in TechArt to say hey we have this thing we think it's really cool but

575
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
we need help figuring this out.

576
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So we had a lot of early collaboration which was really what set us up for success.

577
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
When animator came back with it going from post to post rather than your normal animations

578
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I was like yes that's it.

579
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's what hatred should feel like.

580
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
When you first find the priestess of hatred it's going to look like a lifeless human corpse

581
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and you're like this doesn't look like a boss fight.

582
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm in a boss arena what's going on.

583
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But as you approach you see that the body gets pulled into a giant pool of hatred and

584
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
out of that pool of hatred comes this giant mass of tentacles and that is the boss.

585
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So after animation it gets to come to me and I get to do all of the really cool visual

586
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
effects at the end show what those tentacles are doing when they impact the map when they

587
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:49,000
slap something when they hit the player it really brings the entire thing together.

588
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The comedy attack is really gross because there's like this part of the torso of the humanoid

589
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that has been kind of hollowed out and now has teeth.

590
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The tentacles come out from the mass and they grab the humanoid and kind of pull the body

591
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
back so that the slit in the belly opens up and all of the hatred just pours out a straight

592
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
beam.

593
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's pretty gross.

594
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The hollows are just such a unique family.

595
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
From the moment they spawn in on your screen you can tell that they are different.

596
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
They have just such unique behaviors and animations.

597
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We were able to execute on a vision that's really just so different than what we typically

598
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
do.

599
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The whole process I need to feel very proud of, I'll re-hold you.

600
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Everyone just got it.

601
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
They understood what the monster was.

602
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
They got the vision and it just worked.

603
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The eye on the screen has many functions.

604
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It keeps me in the right frame of mind.

605
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What we are doing is dark.

606
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It should be horrifying.

607
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I should feel the fear while I'm doing it.

608
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
It's a reminder of that.

609
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
The eye also serves as a warning.

610
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I get moving.

611
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Don't dwell too long and wander around.

612
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Get this thing moving.

613
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Get the work done.

614
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm just like shuffling papers trying to grab something really quickly.

615
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Welcome to another Diablo 4 campfire chat.

616
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
My name is Adam Fletcher.

617
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm joined by two familiar faces on our campfire chat.

618
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We have Mr. Adam Jackson, Mr. Colin Feiner.

619
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Hello everyone.

620
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's been a little while since we've seen everyone.

621
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We obviously have lots of have has changed since our last stream.

622
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We ended up launching Vessel of Hatred, which is really awesome to see.

623
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Tons of players online checking out all the new features within Diablo 4 and of course

624
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
the spirit born as well.

625
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
We've been hearing a lot about this year or more.

626
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It seems a little awesome.

627
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Awesome.

628
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah.

629
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Awesome.

630
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's too weak.

631
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's too weak.

632
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That's a lot more awesome.

633
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Definitely.

634
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
What we must have definitely heard.

635
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But no, it is a little strong and we've heard that from a lot of people.

636
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We're talking about that a little bit today.

637
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But first before we do jump in, I do want to talk about some plans, upcoming plans that

638
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
we have for streams.

639
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Obviously, we're doing this stream right now for the mid season update.

640
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The mid season update is actually currently scheduled to release next week.

641
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We won't have patch notes immediately after this stream.

642
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
As you know, we're doing the stream on a Tuesday, which is a little bit of a different day

643
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
for us.

644
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
We typically end up doing these streams later in the week when we do release those

645
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
patch notes.

646
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But you will have patch notes later this week.

647
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
We just need to get them through localization.

648
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Make sure everyone sees them and we get through.

649
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We get all the final changes in them before.

650
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We actually do release them.

651
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But you will have the final patch notes from mid season update later this week.

652
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And then again, mid season update next week.

653
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We will be back next week for another stream.

654
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So back to back weeks for streams.

655
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Lots of streams coming up.

656
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So this one's going to be a pretty quick one to go over mid season update.

657
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And then next week, we're actually going to talk about the season 7 PTR.

658
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I should actually call it patch 2.1 PTR is specifically the name of it.

659
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
We're going to be talking about all the changes that are coming with patch 2.1.

660
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That stream is also going to be a little earlier than when PTR is planning on actually starting.

661
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That's only because for those here in the US that are aware of it, the Thanksgiving holiday

662
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
is coming up towards the end of November.

663
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And we won't have people in the office.

664
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So we want to make sure that we can do the stream a little early and talk to everyone

665
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
about the patch 2.1 PTR before the end of the month.

666
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
PTR itself is planning on starting after the holidays or after that Thanksgiving holiday

667
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
in the US.

668
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And then for the notes regarding PTR, we'll have that before the holidays.

669
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So everyone can get to, at least in the US, they can eat turkey, read patch notes.

670
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And elsewhere.

671
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Perfect thing.

672
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
They can just read patch notes.

673
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So we have a lot of stuff coming up and a lot to talk about.

674
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But before we do get towards some of the other items I know Colin, you want to talk a

675
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
little bit about where we're at with D4 at the moment?

676
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Yeah, absolutely.

677
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So I'll try and keep it short and sweet for the mid season.

678
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
We actually think, I just wanted to talk a little bit about how we think about the game

679
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
currently.

680
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
We've changed a lot over the past year.

681
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
We've changed our optimization.

682
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
We've changed all of the progression.

683
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And generally, I think we've seen a ton of positive feedback around a lot of the progression

684
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
changes made in X1, which is fantastic.

685
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
We're really excited to make a lot of these changes.

686
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I think it's hit a lot of the goals in terms of opening up what builds you can actually

687
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
play and experience a lot of the end game, which is great.

688
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Of course, there's a spare-borne kicking ass and PTR 150.

689
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But otherwise, there's a lot of builds that can cut it in the end game, starting in

690
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Tourment 1.

691
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And I think that's been successful for us.

692
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And I also think a lot of the itemization changes we've made in terms of ancestral items,

693
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
we think that they're a little bit on the low side.

694
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
We'll talk a little bit more next week in the PTR in terms of buffing those.

695
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But we think it's actually pretty cool that there's those chase items that people are

696
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
looking for.

697
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And I think just generally, we're pretty happy with how a lot of things landed.

698
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And right now, we're taking a step back and seeing, okay, now that we've made a lot of

699
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
these changes, what are the more iterative steps we're going to take in the next year

700
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
in terms of tightening up a lot of things?

701
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Full disclosure, I think we missed the market a little bit on material tuning and things

702
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
like that.

703
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So we're not looking at how to do a couple updates on material tuning.

704
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah, just a couple.

705
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So we're really looking at tightening up a lot of those things and making more iterative

706
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
changes to the overall progression of the game.

707
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And we hope that that creates some more stability.

708
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And that lets us put more time and focus on balance and adding more things and leveling

709
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
up the game in that way.

710
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, just thinking back a year ago, so much has changed in our systems.

711
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
We did all of our combat math over again.

712
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
We changed resistances.

713
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
We changed how Loot drops in the whole upgrade system there in season four.

714
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Unique's got a big overhaul.

715
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
There's been so much change in things.

716
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm looking forward to having a chance for things to settle down.

717
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We can fine tune or refine the existing systems that we have now that we have so many ways

718
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
of progressing your character, making yourself stronger.

719
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And I think there's a lot of room for improvement inside of these systems to make them kind

720
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
of better, which I know people who are requesting a lot.

721
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So we're looking forward to that.

722
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah, it's really about refining what we currently have.

723
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We feel like the structure is really strong right now.

724
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah, unless definitely.

725
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And I know with this midseason update, we, of course, the biggest topic that we've been

726
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
hearing a lot is round class balance, specifically around like spirit born right now and how it

727
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
is performing very well compared to some of the other classes.

728
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And so it's around him, Jackson.

729
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I know you wanted to talk a little bit about some of the class balance.

730
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah, let's talk about classes.

731
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We've got a lot to go over today.

732
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So first, just to give an overview of what I'm going to talk about.

733
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
First, we're going to talk a little bit about kind of the state of season six and kind

734
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
of how we see things and how things are going.

735
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And then we're going to give you a preview of some of the changes that we're going to be

736
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
doing for all of the classes.

737
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And then we're going to talk about the normal disclaimer here.

738
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You know, we're not going to be covering everything that we're going to do here in the past.

739
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There could be a lot more notes than what I'm showing today, but just to kind of give you

740
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
an idea of what's coming for each class and kind of what you can look forward to.

741
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So yeah, the current state of season six.

742
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So, you know, a whole lot of people are enjoying the spirit born.

743
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I think this class has been really successful.

744
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You know, we've been hearing that it's a lot of fun.

745
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And people are really liking kind of the way that you build, the way that you play.

746
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And just the class in general, which is really gratifying for the team.

747
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Just for some stats here, 62% of all players have played the spirit born.

748
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So when you think the other six classes in the game now, and 62% of people are playing

749
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
it, that's kind of a lot of love for the class, which is pretty exciting to see.

750
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And to give you a basis of comparison here, the Sorceress in season five was the most

751
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
played class, and she was at 32%.

752
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So you know, like the idea that was, you know, lightning spear meta, and you know, this

753
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
class was really, really good.

754
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
A lot of people had fun.

755
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And so you can kind of compare there just how many people kind of logged into the expansion

756
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and enjoyed that.

757
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So it's pretty exciting.

758
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, just a few, right?

759
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yeah, so kind of the state of the game, you know, the spirit born is performing quite

760
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
a bit better than other classes, which you want to dig deep, you know, do a little bit

761
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
of a deep dive into how and why and how we think about it.

762
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Largely, a big culprit of this is actually due to unintended interactions that the class

763
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
has with how something scale and other issues.

764
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But then there's also another component that there are some balance issues with the class

765
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
itself.

766
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And so it's pretty easy to conflate these two.

767
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And they go, how much of the power is due to like, you know, bugs run in tenant interactions

768
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and how much of it is just some things have high numbers.

769
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
We do think it's a bit of both, but the unintended interactions, I think, are the lion's share

770
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
of what's going on here.

771
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But on the bright side, the other classes are actually performing fairly well when compared

772
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
to one another.

773
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So if you look at, you know, barbarian, compared to necromancer or jurid, compared to sorceress,

774
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
they're actually pretty close and competitive when we see like, pitch your clears and other

775
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
content how they're doing, which is a really good sign for us.

776
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So when we're thinking of kind of what we're going to do going forward and how we balance

777
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
the game, there's kind of two really statements that we need to think about when it comes to balance.

778
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
The first one that's really important is we want players to feel strong and powerful

779
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and to kind of feel like they can break the game and find these crazy builds and do awesome

780
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
things with.

781
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And then on the other side of the coin, we also want kind of, you know, class balance

782
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and parity when it comes to a power level with one another, right?

783
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You know, we don't want a situation that exists for a really long time where, you know,

784
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the only answer is to play barbarian, for example, compared to everything else.

785
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And that's all that you kind of be pushed into playing.

786
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So these two things are kind of at odds with one another.

787
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And we've kind of gone back and forth on our strategies here.

788
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
If you remember back when we launched the obel-four, we really actually prioritized class

789
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,000
parity and harmony over, you know, everything else over the power fantasy of the game.

790
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And what this resulted in was every time that someone found a build that was really strong

791
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
and crazy, we just kind of would fix the bugs or nerf the build and we ended up kind of

792
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
playing Wacomal every time that player's found something cool.

793
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And it ended up being that Blizzard kind of turned into the fun police, which players

794
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
really didn't like.

795
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
We got a pretty big reaction at the end of the launch period and into season one when

796
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
we tried to only think about class parity over kind of the power fantasy of Diablo.

797
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And in season two, we kind of really turned things around in the way that we thought about

798
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the game and we really prioritized, you know, power fantasy and this idea that our players

799
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
kind of want to break the game and be crazy.

800
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The big, shiny example there was Bull Lightning for you source-sourced mains where that skill,

801
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
you know, had an unintended interaction.

802
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It was really, really good.

803
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But players really liked it and had a lot of fun.

804
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And so if you remember a long time ago, we came on live stream and we talked about this

805
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and we kind of said that we were going to allow players to kind of break the game in this

806
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
way until the next season, right?

807
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
There are some exceptions that we'll make where we'll fix things in the mid season if

808
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
it's impacting like the performance of the game or the experience of other players,

809
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
like if your build is causing a bunch of lag or something, then we'll fix it right away.

810
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I think in season six, we have this example with the evade build with Spiritborn.

811
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But overall players really like this strategy a whole lot more, right?

812
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
They got to enjoy this kind of the point of playing ARPGs in Diablo in particular of really

813
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
making a powerful character and being able to smash faces with it, right?

814
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah, and the sort of philosophy here is sort of goes even beyond classes, right?

815
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
If you remember season one, we were just nerfing every dungeon that was to perform in and

816
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
like any time, like there was content that was like a little bit out of budget, we'd

817
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
nerf it.

818
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So it's really about sort of establishing a trust with you, the player during that season

819
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
and not trying to sort of force you to exploit the fun early and often.

820
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And it's really about sort of making sure that when you play a season, you know that

821
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
that season is going to work the same throughout the season and we're not going to change

822
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
things midway on you.

823
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, I think another factor I think about too is that now that we've added a lot of

824
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
progression like temporary and master working, there's a lot of time investment that goes

825
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
into making a build, even if you know something that might be unattended.

826
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But it's really, really good and crazy and you spend you know, 40 plus 100 hours, whatever

827
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
making it.

828
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And then if we kind of pull the rug out from under you, it's worrisome to do that to

829
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
players.

830
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I think in the middle of a season.

831
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's all about respecting your time, right?

832
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah.

833
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So in that vein, we are not planning to nerf the spirit born in the mid season patch

834
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
or I think is a thing that's on everybody's mind, like is Blizzard going to do it?

835
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And we've decided that we think it's best for the game to not do it in the mid season.

836
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So in season seven, and we'll be talking about this a little more in the livestream next

837
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
week, we are going to be fixing all the unintended interactions that we found with spirit born.

838
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
We'll also be making balance adjustments to bring them in line with the other classes.

839
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So you can expect a lot of change there.

840
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But until then, you know, enjoy what you've got now.

841
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Yeah.

842
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
All it's there.

843
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I think it's worth digging into the unintended interactions part two, right?

844
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Because it's not necessarily like you picked one legendary paragon node and now you're

845
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
building this ridiculous, right?

846
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah, that's right.

847
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's like you're sort of, you know, for lack of a better word, abusing some of the mechanics,

848
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
right?

849
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
If we know, you know, Viscay Shield is scaling off of max HP, players of port tons of time

850
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
in effort trying to max masterwork their max life and getting all the perfect tempers and

851
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
item affixes, we don't want to take that away from you, right?

852
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
That's not something that we're trying to necessarily destroy all the time commitment you put

853
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
into your character by fixing these things.

854
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So it's not as simple as just fixed unintended interaction, right?

855
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
But just reiterating, it is it, those unintended interactions are things that we will look at

856
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
when we get to season seven and we start off with season seven.

857
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So obviously with midseason update, enjoy it, enjoy it through season six, but come season

858
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
seven and you'll see a preview of some of these changes with season seven in our PTR

859
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
stream next week.

860
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You'll see some of the changes that we plan on.

861
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah, there's a lot coming there, but this isn't about that.

862
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Yeah, that's a lot coming there for everybody that are really exciting.

863
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But yeah, so, but the caveat to all this is if something does come up that impacts other

864
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
players in regards to the game's performance or you're causing lag for the server or whatever,

865
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
we will be fixing those types of interactions as soon as possible.

866
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Like the evade build is our example, right?

867
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
We will fix those right away because we want to make sure that the game is, you know,

868
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
perform it for everybody.

869
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So in the mid season though, we are going to be buffing all of the other classes in the

870
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
mid season patch, but I want to caveat this a little bit with.

871
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It's not going to be to the level of spirit board right now because a lot of that power

872
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
is due to bugs and unintended things.

873
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So we're really going to be buffing the classes to have more parity and harmony with each

874
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
other, but then also to kind of where we plan to bring the spirit board to after, you know,

875
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
the bugs and stuff has been fixed.

876
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
So you will be seeing number buffs, but you know, I wouldn't expect to be at the same level

877
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
as what spirit board is doing right now in the mid season just to be clear because of

878
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
that the bugs are actually a big part of the power level.

879
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah, and we don't want to create an arms race, right?

880
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Where it's like, okay, everyone gets to be pit tier 150, then the natural ask is like,

881
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
okay, I guess we're adding tournament 5, 6, 7, 8, right?

882
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So we don't want to sort of get to a place where, you know, you're ching through 12 different

883
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
tournament tiers, so we're really being cautious about the arms race here.

884
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
We actually think the rest of the classes are in a really good spot.

885
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yeah, and I think you can count on that going forward too, not even just right now,

886
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
but this is kind of the way that we think of things in general.

887
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It's like if all the classes are kind of in this realm, kind of close each other,

888
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
and then one has something unintended that brings like way up here,

889
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
everybody is always like, well, let's just bring everybody else to this.

890
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah.

891
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
But if we do that every time, like you start with this difference,

892
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and then you're here, and then you do this, and then you do this,

893
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
and you're exponentially going to increase the power level of the game just insanely high,

894
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
really fast, right?

895
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And that's not our goal, right?

896
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So if there's something that stands out, we'll let people do it for a while,

897
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
but then we're going to bring it back the next season.

898
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah.

899
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And that's kind of the way that I think you can mostly count on us doing balance

900
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
and how the choices that we make and why.

901
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Definitely.

902
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And the same goes if there's like a underperforming class.

903
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It's like 20 pit tears behind everyone else, right?

904
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
We have no problems with like bringing that up to where the rest of the classes are.

905
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Correct.

906
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah.

907
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
The real goal is to get everything in a pretty good realm of having harmony with one another.

908
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And you know, with something's out balance, it's okay for a season,

909
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
but then we're going to try to breed it back, right?

910
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
That's kind of always our goal.

911
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
So yeah, let's get into the class updates for all the classes.

912
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
We're just going to be going through one by one and kind of giving you a preview of what to see.

913
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Again, this is only a preview.

914
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
There's more than what we're going to show on screen.

915
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah, way more.

916
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Yeah.

917
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This is just like a couple of examples within the stream itself.

918
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And of course, again, just reminder, patch notes later this week,

919
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
once we get everything kind of sorry, we're abnormal time for a stream on a Tuesday.

920
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Normally, we do it on Thursday and usually a patch notes then.

921
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So I expect the patch notes later this week.

922
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah, let's get to it.

923
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So starting off with Barbarian, we got some baseline core skill buffs for pretty much all of them.

924
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Right?

925
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You can see here up here,

926
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
we have a little bit of trouble leveling.

927
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The other late game is really good, but just getting there, it can be a little bit painful.

928
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So we're just going to be squeezing up those numbers a little bit more.

929
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So you'll have a better time leveling.

930
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You'll also be a little bit stronger overall.

931
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But all the builds will get a little bit better.

932
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And then also we have some buffs to underperforming legendaries in Unix.

933
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Here's an example with an aspect battle pad.

934
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You can see here in the before, kind of what's on live right now,

935
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
is a space that you can see here.

936
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And now we're adding a hefty multiplier to it.

937
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So now this is going to be a real offensive aspect.

938
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That's going to give you a bunch of power.

939
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You're going to get up to a 40% damage buff while when you're doing the weapon swapping mechanics.

940
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
So we've kind of finding these places where we can input damage or these underused legendaries or Unix.

941
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
And then adding a reason to make them more compelling.

942
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Next, we got Druid.

943
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So all of the other things we've got are the ones that we've got.

944
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We've got a lot of damage.

945
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
We've got a lot of damage.

946
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
We've got a lot of damage.

947
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
We've got a lot of damage.

948
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
We've got a lot of damage.

949
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
We've got a lot of damage.

950
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Next, we've got Druid.

951
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So all of the Druids' key passives are getting buffed.

952
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm giving a couple of examples here, but I'm pretty sure all of them, the numbers, went up.

953
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So the Peeam ferocity, you've got the crit damage going from 70% to 100% bonus.

954
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And then the bonus damage of injured enemies going from 140% to 200%, which is pretty meaty.

955
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And then the one with nature passive that buffs your companions, that bonus damage is going from 60% to 80%,

956
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
which is a pretty big amount.

957
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And then also legendary unique buffs in the same way of barbarian.

958
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
So here, this is an offensive aspect, even though I'd argue it's kind of more utility, but the Storm Chaser's aspect

959
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
where it makes your tornadoes smart, where they sneak enemies.

960
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
We're just adding a pretty good multiplier to that.

961
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So tornado builds rejoice.

962
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You're going to get up to 50% more damage now just from taking this aspect that you were probably taking anyways.

963
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So just making you happier to take the same things.

964
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Next one, the Basilisk.

965
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
This is Earth Druid dealing with Petrify.

966
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So before, it was that the first time that you hit an enemy, you'll petrify them.

967
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
And then every time you petrify them, it deals a bunch of damage.

968
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We're just making that a lot more usable, so that way you can feel more comfortable taking it.

969
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So now it's going to be when you hit a healthy enemy, you'll petrify them.

970
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And also, this will work against bosses.

971
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So every five seconds that you hit a boss, you'll attempt to petrify, and then you'll get that bonus damage proc.

972
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So basically, this unique now will be giving you a damage proc every five seconds against bosses,

973
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
which will be a lot better than now, where it doesn't really do much to bosses at all.

974
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Next, we got the Necromancer.

975
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So they're getting buffs for all their basic skills.

976
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm showing decompose here as an example.

977
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
The damage is almost being doubled.

978
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Your essence gain per second is going up by quite a bit.

979
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And also now it'll scale with the tax speed bonuses.

980
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So now if you build a tax speed or you have it, decompose is going to be generating essence for you quicker,

981
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
which it didn't used to before.

982
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
They're also getting some buffs and kind of some simple functionality changes to some passives.

983
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So an example here with the Evolition Passive is before you would get increased crit damage to vulnerable enemies.

984
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And now we're just going to remove that double work firement there, focusing on crit andvone.

985
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So now you'll just get more damage against vulnerable enemies.

986
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So it's just a lot more usable.

987
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
It's now used, you can use it more generally.

988
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
You don't have to worry about creating all the time to get the bonus.

989
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So it'll just be more consistent.

990
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And then we've got some unique buffs here.

991
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
These are just number buffs, some examples.

992
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
We've got Mordor Crocs, so their chance to spawn the Skeletal Simalacrum is going up.

993
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And how from below you're just getting more corpse explosion damage out of it.

994
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So just to need up these numbers to make them competitive.

995
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Next we've got the Rogue.

996
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So similar to the Barbarian, the Rogue is also getting buffs to the core skills.

997
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Pettitrade Shot damage is going up.

998
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Flurry damage is going up as some examples.

999
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Also their key passives are getting a bit better too.

1000
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Victimized damage scaling is going up for your vulnerable damage bonus.

1001
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And precision is going up by a pretty hefty amount from 15% to 20% of your crit damage bonus.

1002
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
So those will just be a lot more potent.

1003
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And next we've got the Sorceress kind of keeping on the theme of buffing key passives.

1004
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So this one works, you're doing a bit of a functionality change.

1005
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So combustion before used to be that, you know, you get a big multiplier to your burning damage.

1006
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
60%.

1007
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And then after that we kind of wanted to reward you for putting different burning sources on enemies.

1008
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And you would get a little bit of a bonus per source.

1009
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Now we're doing away with that second part.

1010
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So you're still getting the burning damage buff just across the board.

1011
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But now we're actually going to tie it to itemization.

1012
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So now you'll just be getting an additional multiplier based on your damage to burning enemies bonus.

1013
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So now you're going to be looking for that, you know, in your gear and your paragon and other places.

1014
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So you can now just really buff up the burning damage.

1015
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And you don't have to worry about putting a bunch of sources on enemies.

1016
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Next, a similar vein avalanche.

1017
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
This key passive is just getting better and is going to be tuning into a damage bonus as well.

1018
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So before it was that your frost skills have a chance, a lucky hit chance to make your next cast of a few different skills.

1019
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Be consumed no matter and be stronger.

1020
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And when you hit vulnerable enemies, it just made the chance better.

1021
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And now we're just buffing up the chance baseline going from 10 to 30% to make that free cast and bonus damage.

1022
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
But now the actual damage that you deal is going to be increased by your damage.

1023
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You get vulnerable enemies stat.

1024
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So now if you we've added basically a scaling multiplier to this key passive.

1025
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So it should be doing a lot more damage over time.

1026
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Next, we got aspect of piercing cold.

1027
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
This is for you ice shards, enjoyers.

1028
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
This one's getting a whole lot better.

1029
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So before it used to be that the number of pierces was part of the random roll.

1030
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And then also the roll made it deal your subsequent hits deal less damage with ice shards.

1031
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And now we flip the script now.

1032
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And now the amount of enemies that I was going to pierce is going to be statics.

1033
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You're just getting more consistent value.

1034
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
But instead of doing less damage, you're going to deal more damage per enemy hit.

1035
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So that actual difference of going from less to more is going to amount to a substantial increase in the amount of damage that this legendary is pumping out for ice shards.

1036
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It's a huge spread.

1037
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Mass物 at least for the sorceress.

1038
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
We introduced a couple of new legendary aspects in vessel of hatred.

1039
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
We've got them there scaling with charge bolts and incinerate.

1040
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And both of these aspects were dealing what we call flat damage or it was like a certain damage amount.

1041
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And it didn't really scale up as you scaled the scale up.

1042
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And we've changed that for both of these.

1043
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So the aspect of charge flash and the aspect of overheating will now both scale as you get more charge bolt or more incinerate damage.

1044
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
These ones will be dealing a lot more damage as well.

1045
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So these ones will just scale with you and be a lot better over time as you get stronger.

1046
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And next last but not least, we got the spirit form.

1047
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So we did do some changes here.

1048
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
We really mostly did small buffs to skills that haven't really been being used or seen less success.

1049
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So we got razor wings here.

1050
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
The damage is going up a bit.

1051
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And also razor wings used to have actually a set cooldown between casts.

1052
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And now we removed that cooldown.

1053
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So now you can actually cast razor wings faster as you build a tax speed like all other skills in the game.

1054
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
We also did some small buffs to withering fist.

1055
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The poison damage went up, the slow went up, and one of the upgrades will now spread to more targets when you use it.

1056
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And then we also got some buffs to toxic skin, which isn't really seen much play by players.

1057
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
We basically just did some small buffs to establish both baseline, the enhancement and one of the upgrades to the variance of it.

1058
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And these are mostly just on the skills that people aren't actually using right now.

1059
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
The correct rule is until like make the spirit form even stronger.

1060
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
No, these are, this is tuning within the builds of the most.

1061
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
We're most definitely saying Chad and they're like, wait, spirit form buffs and it's like these are like skills that really no one is using.

1062
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So we want to make sure that.

1063
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I mean, that's cool.

1064
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
There you are.

1065
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah, cool.

1066
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Most certainly need spots apparently.

1067
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
No, but it's for things that we just haven't seen a lot of play within spirit form players.

1068
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And a lot of players are looking at some of the numbers and they're also.

1069
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
These are just like baseline numbers on some of these skills.

1070
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Obviously, there's a lot of interactions that happen beyond that from tempering to the gear that you have and everything like that that will end up obviously enhancing those even more.

1071
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So we're expecting to, as Adam mentioned before, we're not expecting to see the other classes jump up to the same power as the spirit born because the spirit born again is using something unintended interactions right now.

1072
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But those will be addressed in season seven.

1073
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So with these classes specifically, they will get some additional buffs so that they can stay competitive amongst each other.

1074
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
They're staying together as a pack but being a little bit stronger here with the mid season.

1075
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Yeah, the idea with mid season, this is probably going to be true with most mid season updates is that we're trying to move everything a little closer together and also to set up for the next season where there will be a lot more up people.

1076
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yeah, so we're like prepping everything to be kind of close and then people.

1077
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Oh, yeah.

1078
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I was like, haha, we're getting ready.

1079
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Is that a hint to be a lot more easter egg?

1080
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Cool. Awesome. Well, I know we have a, again, Adam had mentioned that this is just a very small.

1081
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah, a lot more than just that.

1082
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
There's a lot more than just what we showed here.

1083
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
That would be the shortest patch in the summer.

1084
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But we do actually have a patch on us coming out later this week that will have all the different class changes and everything with the mid season update.

1085
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:07,000
We do have a few other things that are actually also hitting related to rune words and a thing that a lot of people have been talking about, which is shrine specifically.

1086
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yes.

1087
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So we can, we can shrine.

1088
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
What's wrong with shrines?

1089
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
What's wrong with the conduit shrine that I don't purposely ignore?

1090
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah.

1091
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You mean the real curse shrine?

1092
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
There you go.

1093
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Alright, jumping into rune words first.

1094
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
We are doing some tuning changes to rune words.

1095
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I will tease a little bit that we do have some more impactful changes coming in season seven.

1096
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So tune in next week for them.

1097
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
But in the meantime, we did do some room word buffs to ones that aren't being used as much mostly by lower in offering costs.

1098
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Some examples here.

1099
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
We got the moaning rune word.

1100
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
The offering that you get is increased from 25 to 35.

1101
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,000
The all who rune word, the offering is being increased a lot from 10 to 25 when hitting injured enemies.

1102
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And then I'm just going to butcher it.

1103
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I don't know how to say it, but the sad rune word.

1104
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
The wolf spirits are now always going to be unhindered.

1105
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
We often run into issues where companions and things like that have trouble getting to enemies, but since they're spirits.

1106
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So why would other things get in the way?

1107
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Now they'll always be moving through enemies and getting into their targets a lot quicker.

1108
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And then shrines heard some feedback that they don't really scale too well.

1109
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So the artillery, blast wave and conduit shrines will now deal more damage and they're going to scale with you based on your level and your paragon level.

1110
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So as you level up, as you get stronger, the shrines will be getting more potent with you.

1111
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
We're going to kind of test it.

1112
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
You know, let us know how it goes.

1113
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
See if you actually enjoy getting them and want to get them now.

1114
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:39,000
We do see some room maybe to do some more things above them further if needed, but we're going to be trying this as a first step to see how it goes.

1115
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah, I know we've heard from a lot of people about like, especially as you get to the later levels and your towards end game in tournament four.

1116
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And a conduit trying to pierce and it's like, don't touch it because maybe that will make things slower, which it currently typically does for a lot of players, especially spirit form players.

1117
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
So it's cool to see updates of these shrines.

1118
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And then again, like feedback is really important for us to know like, hey, do we hit the mark?

1119
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Do we need to do additional things or do we need to tweak anything?

1120
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So let us know after you guys get a chance to check out the new adjustments to the shrines.

1121
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
So that'll be really important for us.

1122
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Some other things that are coming down the line.

1123
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:27,000
We do have some in-game specific events and items that we'll be hitting here in the coming weeks.

1124
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Weeks is a little bit after mid season update.

1125
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:39,000
We do actually have another, we're bringing back the Red Cloak Horror, which is part of the mid-winner blight event that we had last year.

1126
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And we'll actually have a blog that details all the benefits and rewards out of this.

1127
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It's like XP benefits, of course, that do come with this specifically, which is really great to have on top of another event that's coming, which is Mother's Blessing.

1128
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And Mother's Blessing will also be, we'll have that in the blog.

1129
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
That blog is going to be hitting on Thursday, I believe.

1130
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
So keep an eye out for eternal players.

1131
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:15,000
We also have a cool little thing, like kind of like a welcome back booster type of event for them or maybe it's not an event.

1132
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I don't know how to coin it, but like Colin, what does that entail?

1133
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah, so we wanted to put together just something to get you back into the action.

1134
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I know part of X1 ended up sort of marking a bunch of items as legacy.

1135
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So we just wanted to give everyone a one time booster to come back.

1136
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
We're going to level you to 50. We'll give you a build that we've made.

1137
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
We've made three different ones per class. You'll be able to use it.

1138
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I'm sure everyone watching probably doesn't care, but we have, you will care about this if you haven't done this, is we're going to unlock all the altars of Lilith as part of that boost.

1139
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So if you log in and just use it and you haven't got all your altars for free, you need to get it for free.

1140
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
If you're a based game, Diablo IV owner, you'll end up getting, I believe, one of those boosts.

1141
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And then if you're a vessel of hatred, you'll end up getting two of those boosts on eternal characters, which is kind of cool.

1142
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So if you want to jump back in or anything, especially after the changes with, there goes my earpiece.

1143
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I've been fumbling it with it all day and now it's gone.

1144
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But I know a lot of players specifically with season six jumping back in, they notice as you mentioned, a lot of the gear went to legacy gear.

1145
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So this kind of gives them a way of being able to kind of recover some of that.

1146
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yeah, refreshes it exactly.

1147
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And then I believe we also have a, another free trial coming up for any new players that want to check out at the Spirit Board.

1148
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And the Spirit Board will actually be part of the free trial and that will be coming up here in the coming weeks.

1149
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And so all this will be in a blog on Thursday, which is really cool.

1150
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And then of course, as we mentioned at the start of the show, we have another stream next week.

1151
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We'll actually have a date for the stream later this week for players so that you guys can keep an eye out for that.

1152
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But that is our patch 2.1 PTR stream and that one will be pretty beefy.

1153
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:13,000
We have a lot to talk about regarding patch 2.1 and of course everything that's going to be coming with season seven.

1154
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
We are super stoked for that.

1155
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It's the stream again will be a little early because of the Thanksgiving holiday.

1156
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
So a little bit earlier than when PTR is going to start.

1157
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
We do plan on having those notes available for players before the Thanksgiving holiday.

1158
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
And then I would expect that PTR to start after the Thanksgiving holiday.

1159
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:39,000
So when everyone is back in post holiday and is able to monitor and see how everything is going with PTR taking the feedback.

1160
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So we'll have a stream next week.

1161
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
You'll see of course some of us back on the stream next week for that.

1162
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And I believe we'll be joined by Mr. Dan Tangue again who will be in Albany and chiming in on all the stuff that's coming with season seven and patch 2.1.

1163
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
So lots of big changes coming specifically with that.

1164
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I know we do want to jump into some Q&A really quickly.

1165
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So if you guys have any questions, we have Chad enabled on Twitch.

1166
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
So it twitch.tv slash Diablo.

1167
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
If you're watching on other channels and stuff like that.

1168
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
That's where we do take in specific questions.

1169
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
But feel free to drop in any questions.

1170
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
We'll try to get through as many as we can here.

1171
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Again, this is just kind of an abbreviated stream for the mid season update.

1172
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And we'll be back in a week.

1173
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Next week.

1174
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Yeah.

1175
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I get it.

1176
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
We took a little bit of a break from streaming.

1177
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So it kind of makes sense.

1178
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So that will be we'll be back pretty quickly.

1179
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
But I know our first question that we have is related to ancestral items.

1180
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
We get a lot of questions about ancestral items.

1181
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I've seen a lot of questions.

1182
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Oh, this earpiece is driving.

1183
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Not.

1184
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Question number one.

1185
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Adam, fix your earpiece.

1186
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
There's a plant right here which you guys can't see.

1187
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So I'm like having to read the screen.

1188
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Any updates and ancestral items.

1189
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Do you guys have any updates or news to share regarding that?

1190
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Yeah, I know we saw a lot of confusion in terms of maxing out a lot of the codex of power.

1191
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:09,000
In x1, we actually added roughly what we call ranks five ranks to a lot of the legendary aspects that were ancestral only.

1192
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And I know that caused a lot of confusion.

1193
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So currently how it works is ancestral items have a higher upper bounds on the rank that you can achieve for that aspect.

1194
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And we have seen quite a bit of people struggling to max out their aspects.

1195
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Generally that was the goal is that we do want to grind.

1196
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Like we think it's good that you can sort of get an aspect right away.

1197
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
But we like that once you have that play style assembled, we still want things that you need to work on.

1198
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
That being said, we think it's a little bit too aggressive right now.

1199
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So we are going to be making some changes which we will detail next week in terms of how that actually works.

1200
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
But just know that currently ancestral items are the sort of where you find the max rank of a lot of those aspects.

1201
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
But you can still find them on anything else that isn't ancestral the lower version.

1202
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Yeah. I know as Emma will be talking more about ancestral items next week.

1203
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Yeah, specifically.

1204
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeah, the drought.

1205
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Yeah, a lot of stuff regarding that.

1206
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Is there any plans?

1207
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
This is taking a few questions from the forums and of course chat because we did post this on the forums beforehand.

1208
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Erza from the forum says, can we get boss materials to stack like runes or maybe even higher?

1209
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Are there any plans for something like that?

1210
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yeah, we are looking into it.

1211
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,000
There's things on the our side in terms of like storage and doping that we're a little bit worried about.

1212
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But we're looking at making a change some some time in the longer future.

1213
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Question from a couple people like our art angel 890 and drag not going to drag and drag drag some drag and nudge.

1214
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Says any chances that you guys will potentially change like XP gain, maybe the growth to paragon 300.

1215
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Is there any plans on maybe making adjustments or tuning specifically on that?

1216
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Currently not at the moment. I think it's something we're monitoring though in terms of the feedback.

1217
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:12,000
We do like that you can get just about everything within the first 200 paragon levels and everything from there has a pretty steep diminishing return in terms of power.

1218
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:23,000
So what we don't want to say to you all is like you need to grind 200 hours to unlock your build and do all the things that are sort of play style defining which we define as like the sort of glyphs and the legendary notes.

1219
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So we've seen actually a lot of positive feedback that like you can get your build online and that you still have something to work towards.

1220
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:40,000
The sooner we sort of short circuit that paragon grind the more we sort of get back to that pre expansion one state where you just don't get anything from killing monsters because you're paragon 300 in the first two weekend.

1221
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
So currently you know we're looking at monitoring it and we're super open to the feedback.

1222
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
But so far we've seen a good amount of positivity around.

1223
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I think it's kind of in line with what you're talking about with the legendary powers right now like those last five ranks are on and Cesar items only and so our idea is like we want you to get your build online and play the way you want.

1224
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yeah within a pretty you know pretty quickly or whatever.

1225
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
But then you have something to work towards incrementally to become stronger and stronger and that we're okay with taking a long time.

1226
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Totally.

1227
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
As long as it's not like cutting you off from the build at all.

1228
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Yeah it's about getting you into the fun and like making sure that your build is blasting but you have things to sort of use that full to blast for.

1229
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Yeah and I think there's like the other thing that people are probably forgetting about is like we do have these events coming up and stuff which also benefit.

1230
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:38,000
We've seen everything like that which will be a good opportunity for players to like people you know if they really want because there as we've seen there are there is a reward for getting to paragon 300 and stuff.

1231
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So it allows players that opportunity kind of use those events to be able to boost them we have obviously right code course stuff coming up here and of course we have a mothers blessing so there's opportunities to help with some of that XP based off of those events specifically.

1232
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So there is a question regarding like materials again you know can we expect any additional buffs for drop rates on raw hide iron for gun souls anything like that.

1233
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Yeah so actually it is in the mid season but we did buff Legion events I know that was a personal favorite of a lot of folks for the mid season for season seven we're taking a look at just sort of buffing the various sources and also really drilling down on like what are the bottlenecks players are having and iterating towards that.

1234
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:34,000
There's no major changes coming in season seven like we're not going to quadruple the amount of materials across the game but it is something again in the spirit of like tightening the things that we have.

1235
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:43,000
We are actively looking at a lot of the material inflows and outflows and we want to give you the tools to sort of get the materials that you're looking for.

1236
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So what we're trying to do is ensure that there are things that you still care about right and you still want to grind it's still in that spirit of like it's walking that fine line of their things to work towards without it feeling super tedious so that's what we're trying to tighten and work towards.

1237
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:28,000
There is a question regarding do you have this from Remster Ma says do you have any plans and start bringing in new mid season mechanics I think for that more so I would expect like larger mechanics content changes and stuff like that to happen around new seasons as opposed to a mid season update I think we look at taking mid season updates making tweaks to you know balance item.

1238
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So we're going to have to do some of these new mid seasons and we're going to do some new seasons.

1239
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So if we're going to do some of these new mid seasons or anything that we're hearing feedback from.

1240
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I said that we can spend most of our you know concentration focus on really putting in some of these new work type of content pieces around new season specifically.

1241
01:06:49,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Things but we're really putting all our books like bigger up heavals you know larger changes lots of new stuff into the beginning of the season so next week will be pretty exciting we got a lot new stuff coming in.

1242
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
But that's where we're kind of targeting that to make that kind of a big moment and exciting time to come back and play.

1243
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:16,000
There is a question from casual drag in regarding under city drops and asking is there any plans to potentially fix those make those better specifically on that end.

1244
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Yeah so this sort of leads into there are some ancestral draw for a change is the one to talk about next week but in general what that'll mean is all the loot across the game generally get better so it is something that we're working on.

1245
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I'm about to take this earpiece and throw it across the room because it just keeps popping out and it's driving me insane.

1246
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:58,000
That's a question from Pesradar the any question from thin a thin a fan am dar says Diablo any at Diablo any stability fixes coming and seeing a whole lot more crashes since the last couple patches I will say that we've been monitor we can actually see whenever a play.

1247
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:27,000
We can actually see whenever a player actually crashes we we know it we get logs from it on our end I know that the engineering team here has been doing a ton of work on working to get the game more stable you've probably seen a bunch of different small climb patches go out we actually just reenabled like DLSS in a climb patch that went out yesterday there are additional changes and more reviewing that's being done.

1248
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:52,000
From our side to ensure that you know the game is running very stable so expect to see more of that as we get through this season of course into next season because our goal is to make sure you know baseline everyone can jump in without any of these types of issues and everything and shout out to our engineering team I know they've been working long and hard on figuring all this stuff out they've been that's like their top priority right.

1249
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:12,000
They actually behind the scenes we even collaborate with them a lot on doing various things related to game performance under the hood like making skills cleaner making interactions cleaner like we're constantly doing stuff to make the game run smoother in the background pretty much every patch like we're fixing multiple things so it's definitely something that we're we're always working on actively.

1250
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Why so blue panda bear any chance on tempering schools can use more than once investing time to finally get a rare drop and and it bricks kind of doesn't feel too great.

1251
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Any thoughts on tempering schools how that's been going yeah I think it's definitely something we hear a lot of feedback on and it's something that you know we were sort of taking incremental approach right like with the X one or the expansion one changes we made it so that a lot of recipes are three.

1252
01:09:40,000 --> 01:10:01,000
We also added of course the scroll of tempering or restoration and expansion one to see how that sort of changes things so we're just really taking a measured approach if we see still there's a lot of feedback that it just still isn't hitting that mark we're absolutely open to changing things like potentially letting it be used more than once and we're just sort of monitoring at this point.

1253
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
We are getting questions about the armory stay tune.

1254
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:21,000
TM soon TM will we'll we'll have information as you guys know that that has been in development something that we've already confirmed about I will be talking more about it here soon TM so.

1255
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Yeah your eyes peel is that that is that the term keep your eyes peeled I don't know I there's a saying that you know stay tuned I don't know last question here that we have before we we head off is a holes transition says well dance and eyes get buffs and any changes to be more compatible with collecting loot like opening doors etc you know when you're when you're going you're spending to win with your knives and stuff is there anyway.

1256
01:10:50,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Are any plans of potentially having them seamlessly move around around a dungeon or something like that from nothing on my radar right now but that's a good note to take it's a good to know today row is want to spend away.

1257
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I never I know you have to do all this set up in snapshot and then you have to like open the door so we do know the thing yeah so we'll see well it's been stay tuned it's it's another thing to stay tuned so.

1258
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Again thanks again everyone for for jumping in providing questions and everything from from our end we will have patch notes later this week so stay tuned for that the blogs for mothers blessing the workload or our eternal boost off everything will be out on Thursday so also check out for that blog mid season update hits next week so patch notes will be out before the mid season update and you guys will also hear about the
