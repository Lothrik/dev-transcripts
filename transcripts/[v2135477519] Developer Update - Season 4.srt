1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
so

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I can put on my Русço often rehums work, and when I was travails around, my lady had

1950 salmon in pet

so

18
00:05:40,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you.

19
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank you.

20
00:06:40,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you.

21
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you.

22
00:07:40,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank you.

23
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you.

24
00:08:40,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Thank you.

25
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Thank you.

26
00:09:40,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Thank you.

27
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you.

28
00:10:40,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you.

29
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Thank you.

30
00:11:40,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Thank you.

31
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you.

32
00:12:40,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Thank you.

33
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Thank you.

34
00:13:40,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Thank you.

35
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you.

36
00:14:40,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Thank you.

37
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you.

38
00:15:40,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Thank you.

39
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Thank you.

40
00:16:40,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Thank you.

41
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Thank you.

42
00:17:40,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Thank you.

43
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Thank you.

44
00:18:40,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Thank you.

45
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Thank you.

46
00:19:40,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Thank you.

47
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Thank you.

48
00:20:40,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Thank you.

49
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Thank you.

50
00:21:40,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Thank you.

51
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Thank you.

52
00:22:40,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Season 4,

53
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Season 4,

54
00:23:40,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Thank you.

55
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Thank you.

56
00:24:40,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Every single, you know,

57
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
better than the others when you're trying to get the perfect build at endgame.

58
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Because of this, in World Tier 4, and only in World Tier 4,

59
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
when an Ancestral Legendary item drops,

60
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
there's a chance the affixes on it can roll as greater affixes.

61
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
These will roll with bigger values that are normally available for that affix.

62
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Greater affixes are fairly rare, but they're not impossible to find.

63
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
While leveling up, you're going to be able to find upgrades

64
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
much more easily with this new system.

65
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Another part of itemization is going to be Masterworking.

66
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Now, this is something really intended for that very high endgame, again, World Tier 4.

67
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
This is where a player is going to take an item,

68
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
already has the affixes that they want on it,

69
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
but now they go through a process of upgrading those affixes,

70
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
getting even higher values on them.

71
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Masterworking really starts at level 100.

72
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Once you've already completed your build and found some of the best items,

73
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
you're going to be able to test your build against the powerful enemies of the pit.

74
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The pit is a new endgame system that has been added in this season

75
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
that is going to challenge players that feel that they have largely maximized their build.

76
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
By pushing into more difficult tiers of the pit,

77
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
you're going to be able to unlock rarer crafting materials

78
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
to masterwork your gear even further.

79
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You're going to have to play some of the hardest content in the game,

80
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
but once you do, if you're successful,

81
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
you can go and make those affixes even stronger.

82
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
In Season 4, we're ramping the intensity of the Helltides

83
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
through the inclusion of a variety of new activities,

84
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
the first of which is a doubling down and rise of the Cultists' presence throughout the tide.

85
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You're going to be running through the Helltides,

86
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
seeing the Cultists just conjuring up swarms and swarms of demons,

87
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
adding to that sense of mannequin chaos that they're pretty well known for.

88
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The other archetype that we're adding is the presence of the Doomsayers,

89
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
who were unfortunate enough to be caught out in the tide

90
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and basically just lost their minds to all of the mania going on around them.

91
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And lastly, rounding out the new activities are just the inclusion of the Iron Wolves.

92
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
They're finally joining the fight.

93
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
They could no longer stand in the sidelines,

94
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
seeing the Helltides and Hells forces intensify their assault on Sanctuary.

95
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
As Season 4 players engage and progress through the Call of the Wolves seasonal activity,

96
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
they'll earn honor with the Iron Wolves,

97
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
unlocking access to a vast assortment of rewards

98
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
to accompany and empower your Season 4 journeys.

99
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
In the update of Helltide,

100
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
for players who are able to stay alive long enough,

101
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
they'll be paid a visit by the Hellborn,

102
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
former heroes of Sanctuary who have aligned with the forces of Hell

103
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
to attack the allies they once aligned with.

104
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Players who are able to take down the Hellborn

105
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
will be acquiring the materials they need

106
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
to engage with the new premier Helltide activity,

107
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
the Accursed Rituals.

108
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Located in the Helltide, these Accursed Rituals

109
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
are pretty much just botched rituals from the cultists

110
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
that players will be kickstarting for themselves,

111
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
drawing the intention of all the nearby Helltide monsters

112
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
in this kind of all-out battle.

113
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
One of my favorite themes for these ambushes is the Hellworm.

114
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It's literally a giant hell slug beast

115
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
that emerges from the ground and spews out a whole bunch of mobs at you.

116
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
If you're able to survive that,

117
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
you'll be paid a visit from the Blood Maiden,

118
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
our brand new Helltide mini-boss,

119
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and one of the ultimate challenges in the new experience.

120
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So I think I'm actually most excited about this season

121
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
because of what you're able to do with your old characters,

122
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
how they can integrate with this new item game

123
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and take them to new levels of power with this system.

124
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I think that the best part of this update

125
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
is that you're going to be really empowered

126
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
to build the character that you want to play.

127
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You're going to be able to pick custom affixes

128
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and enhance your character in a lot of new and interesting ways.

129
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:29,000
All right.

130
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We were just watching a video.

131
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Literally just finger-gunning the screen for no reason.

132
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And everyone's like,

133
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,000
what are you doing, Adam?

134
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Hey, guys.

135
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,000
How's it going?

136
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Welcome to another Diablo 4 Developer Update livestream.

137
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
My name is Adam Fletcher.

138
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I am the Community Director here for Diablo.

139
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm joined by this wonderful panel

140
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
plus an additional head,

141
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
which we will haul out.

142
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We only have four seats.

143
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We have to swap people around.

144
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
We have to do the same thing we did during the PTR stream,

145
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
which was like we swapped out Joe Shelley,

146
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
and put in Adam Jackson.

147
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That's true.

148
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We did do that.

149
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So we're going to play more magic tricks today.

150
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But do you guys want to do a quick intro

151
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
to yourself to the wonderful Diablo community?

152
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Sure.

153
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm Joe Paipora.

154
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm the Associate Game Director for Diablo 4.

155
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And I'm Adam Jackson,

156
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
the Lead Live Class Designer for Diablo 4.

157
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And we have a new face.

158
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Hello.

159
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm Colin Feiner.

160
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm the Lead Live Game Designer.

161
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Awesome.

162
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And then we're actually going to be joined by Derek.

163
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Who are you?

164
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh, well, I already introduced myself.

165
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh, sorry.

166
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You just missed it.

167
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I know.

168
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm already screwing this up.

169
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I know.

170
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Terrible.

171
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It's my first game.

172
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But we actually have Derek who will be joining us as well.

173
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Derek, you just saw in the video prior,

174
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
talking about Season 4,

175
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
he'll be swapping in to talk a little bit more about Helltides later in this.

176
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But big stream here.

177
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
We have Season 4 coming up.

178
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
As you guys saw earlier this week,

179
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
it is Loot Reborn for Season 4.

180
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And a lot of players actually got to experience it a couple weeks ago with PTR.

181
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
PTR, this was our first Diablo 4 PTR.

182
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It was a massive undertaking from the team here,

183
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
but it was really, really great to have players jump in early,

184
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
check out Season 4 and all the changes,

185
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
and actually provide feedback.

186
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And so we have a lot to cover today

187
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
based off of feedback that we received from players from PTR itself.

188
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But Joe, I know you wanted to jump into kind of talking a little bit more about Season 4,

189
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
how PTR went,

190
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
before we jump into all the changes.

191
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah, happy to.

192
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So, okay.

193
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So last time we were on stream,

194
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
we were actually talking about a lot of the changes

195
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
that players are going to get a chance to check out on the PTR.

196
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So we think that went really, really well.

197
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It was even just having the week of time for players to just jump in

198
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and just crush through all of the content,

199
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
check out all of the new features,

200
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and gets a lot of feedback,

201
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
find a lot of bugs on the way as well.

202
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It was, again, super valuable.

203
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It's been really, really great for the team.

204
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
We'll take a lot of this feedback,

205
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
look at the tuning variety of features,

206
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and really make sure that we've got the best version

207
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
of the Season 4 experience ready

208
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
when we get into the launch today.

209
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So, you know, in terms of, like, our big takeaways,

210
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
first of all, really, really valuable across the board.

211
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Season 4, Season of Loot Reborn was,

212
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
as I mentioned during the PTR stream originally,

213
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
was really our opportunity to go back

214
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
and take a lot of the feedback in that we've been looking at

215
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
since the launch of the game from 2023.

216
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
This art is so good.

217
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I do love the key art for this.

218
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
This key art for Season 3 was awesome as well.

219
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's awesome.

220
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah.

221
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So, yes.

222
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
So, looking back at the...

223
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Thanks for disrupting my flow.

224
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
David Puzar's art is amazing.

227
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So, yeah, looking back at the launch

228
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
of the other products in 2023,

229
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
we've been getting a lot of really good feedback.

230
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You'll remember back in Season 2, Season of Blood,

231
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
we made a big change to vulnerable damage

232
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and the multiplicative damage that comes along with it.

233
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
We made a change to the way the elemental resist worked.

234
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And there were a lot of things we had to do

235
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
to make those changes really shine through.

236
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
There's a lot of Paragon knows it had to get updated.

237
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There were a lot of legendary aspects that had to get changed.

238
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There was a lot of itemization stuff in the background

239
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
that we had to do to make those systems work better

240
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
and lift up other things around them,

241
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
like overpower, for example,

242
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
to make that feel like it was in a better spot.

243
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah.

244
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So now that we're looking at,

245
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
like, even when we were done

246
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
that one big release for Season of Blood,

247
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
we knew that there was a lot more that we wanted to do,

248
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
again, that we've been thinking about.

249
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But there's a lot of work we need to do,

250
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
like make sure that all of these things

251
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
really all fit together cohesively.

252
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So, I mean, as people got a chance to see on the PTR,

253
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
like the introduction of things like the tempering feature,

254
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
which we're going to talk a little bit more in a minute,

255
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
where you get to introduce these new affixes into items,

256
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and affixes you can't get on items anymore,

257
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
the reduction affix count on items overall.

258
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So it's a lot easier to go and sort through

259
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
25 pairs of gloves in your inventory at any given time,

260
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
where you don't really have those same situations.

261
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
We reduced the number of items that drop

262
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
in the game experience overall,

263
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
but made sure that the items that are dropping

264
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
are just more valuable,

265
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
are more likely to be upgrades for you,

266
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
or something you could kind of, like,

267
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
build into an upgrade.

268
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We introduced the masterworking feature, right?

269
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And Colin helped head a lot of these things up, right,

270
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
during working with the teams.

271
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So they introduced the masterworking feature,

272
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
where, you know, players can continually upgrade items

273
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and can increase the value of the affixes,

274
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
and then, you know, at ranks 4 and 8 and 12,

275
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
you get to, like, kind of crit on one of these

276
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and make them even better.

277
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You know, there's a lot of things that were introduced.

278
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
We add the new content type in the form of

279
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
the Pivvy Artificer.

280
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's like this new, like, you know,

281
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
extremely deep and deadly dungeon dive

282
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
players get to go into once they get into the,

283
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
like, towards the end game,

284
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
when you're getting to, like, you know, 85, 90,

285
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,000
your character level,

286
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
you're starting to kind of dip into that space.

287
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And that's where you go to get your masterworking materials,

288
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
which feels really, really good.

289
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And we learned a lot of really great lessons

290
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
from, like, Greater Rifts and Diablo 3,

291
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
because we think there was some really cool content there.

292
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So there's some really, really fun things there.

293
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And then also...

294
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And also the Codex of Power updates.

295
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
You no longer have to save all your legendaries all the time.

296
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Codex of Power updates, which I was like,

297
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
to be fair, I've been kind of...

298
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I've been so excited about the Codex of Power updates,

299
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I've been teasing it for, like, six live streams.

300
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah.

301
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Like, it's not...

302
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
That's so good.

303
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Like, before BlizzCon,

304
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I feel like I tease it at the end of a live stream.

305
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So it's just what it is.

306
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But, again, super excited about the Codex of Power changes.

307
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That is very transformational.

308
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Like, now, when Legendary drops on the ground for you,

309
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
you just salvage it, you get that aspect,

310
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
put it into your Codex,

311
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
add the role that you got,

312
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and you just get to use it in perpetuity.

313
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And we actually have some fun ways,

314
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,000
we'll talk about later,

315
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
how we're playing with that a little bit as we go.

316
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So, I mean, all of this stuff and more,

317
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
we've made huge, huge changes to Helltide.

318
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I know Derek's been talking about it in a little while,

319
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
as he helped lead the team,

320
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
did a lot of the work for that.

321
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And we got to introduce the season theme

322
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
in the form of, like, Loot Reborn,

323
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and then the reintroduction of the Iron Wolves mercenaries,

324
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
the players we're working with

325
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
during the course of the release.

326
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I know that we showed a little bit of that off earlier.

327
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And I am just,

328
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
personally, I'm just really, really excited

329
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
about the release overall,

330
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
as this was an opportunity for us to work with, like,

331
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
not just the season team,

332
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
but also the live team,

333
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
and, like, a lot of support from the systems groups.

334
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And there's a lot of things being done for,

335
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
you know, the expansion, you know,

336
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
that's coming out eventually as well,

337
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,000
like Vessel of Hatred.

338
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So being able to, like, really organize teams

339
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and make sure that we're in a really, really good spot

340
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
to, like, provide this really big update for the game

341
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
has been very, very exciting.

342
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And the feedback, going back to the feedback,

343
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
the feedback from PTR was, again, really, really valuable.

344
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It was great to get players in there

345
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and to get those things taken care of.

346
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And we're going to talk about some of those things today.

347
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I know that some of this information has been, like,

348
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
we talked to, like, a few, like, press outlets,

349
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
we talked to a few different people,

350
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and, like, some information is getting out there.

351
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But I want to make sure we can provide

352
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
a little bit more detail, you know,

353
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
because I know this is the audience

354
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
that wants to know, like, the real specifics.

355
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We're going to get into it, right?

356
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And we'll also have our Q&A, as we usually do at the end,

357
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
where we can, like, answer some more questions

358
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the community might have

359
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
as we kind of go through the whole thing.

360
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So, yeah, I mean, that was the,

361
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
at a high level, that's what we were feeling about the PTR,

362
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
feeling pretty good about it.

363
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm happy to, like, maybe jump into itemization,

364
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,000
or how do we want to go?

365
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah, I think the first thing

366
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
we probably want to talk about

367
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
is, like, the itemization changes

368
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that are in Season 4 that people experience,

369
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
which includes, like, the tempering,

370
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
the masterworking stuff that changed in Season 4.

371
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And, of course, all the feedback that we got

372
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
from both tempering, masterworking,

373
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and what we are planning on doing

374
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
based off of that PTR feedback

375
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
for the launch of Season 4.

376
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yeah, we've got a few updates.

377
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, lots.

378
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah, sure.

379
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So, I guess just starting off, then,

380
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
with, like, high level itemization.

381
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Like, let's go back to, like,

382
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
some of the goals that we had

383
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
when we started, like, down on this,

384
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
started some of the work for Season 4.

385
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Now, we want to make sure that,

386
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
first, players were having an easier time

387
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
comparing items in their inventory.

388
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It was actually one of the first things

389
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,000
we started thinking about

390
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
when we began discussing

391
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
what we thought needed to change

392
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
about itemization.

393
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Because the experience in Season 3

394
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and Season 2 and other seasons

395
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
has really been, like, the player,

396
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
you know, you'll get into, like, the,

397
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,000
you know, you're running your

398
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
high-tier nightmare dungeons,

399
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
you're getting lots of drops,

400
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
you know, you're sorting through

401
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
all of this stuff.

402
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Like, you'll have, like, items that are,

403
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
like, you know, this is, like,

404
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
a 904 iPower sword,

405
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and this is a 909 iPower sword.

406
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Now, I've got, like, six helmets at all,

407
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
or, like, have a wide variety

408
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
of affixes on them.

409
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
We really wanted to, again,

410
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
just to quickly hit this,

411
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
we wanted to make sure

412
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
that we had a lower number

413
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
of affixes overall

414
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
that could roll on different item slots,

415
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
but those affixes were more, like,

416
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
generically useful

417
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
and stuff you could really build around.

418
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
As opposed to having lots of

419
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
really conditional affixes

420
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
going back to, like, the,

421
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
you know, the Damage on Tuesdays joke,

422
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
you know, like, that's...

423
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The shirt that...

424
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
The shirt that...

425
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Literally wearing it now.

426
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Literally wearing it.

427
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So, huge proponent...

428
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's always funny.

429
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So, it's, obviously,

430
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
because it's a joke, right?

431
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, jokes are always funny.

432
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
But the truth is, like,

433
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
we wanted to make sure that...

434
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Where we wanted to have

435
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
conditional affixes in the game,

436
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
we wanted to find places

437
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
where players would be able

438
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,000
to opt into them

439
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
in a very specific way.

440
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You know, so initially,

441
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
we want items that you're, you know,

442
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
really dropping for you

443
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
to have more generic utility,

444
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
just be more valuable

445
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,000
for you overall.

446
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And also, as a result of this,

447
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
make it easier

448
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
to compare those items.

449
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So, one of the changes

450
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,000
that we made

451
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
is we actually reduced

452
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
the number of affixes

453
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
that can naturally

454
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
roll on item slots.

455
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
So, like, now, like, you know,

456
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
a rare item can roll,

457
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
like, two affixes,

458
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
a legendary item

459
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
can roll three affixes,

460
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
but then later on,

461
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
there's other systems

462
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,000
you get to introduce...

463
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We'll talk about in a bit.

464
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It lets you introduce

465
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
more of those.

466
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And we did that,

467
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
so it's just easier

468
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,000
to go through things.

469
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
We also made all items

470
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
post-level 100, 925.

471
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So, you're no longer

472
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,000
comparing, like,

473
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
the designer number

474
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
that's, like, 904 to 925.

475
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You're just focusing

476
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
on what's cool

477
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,000
about the item,

478
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,000
which is the affixes.

479
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, which is super important,

480
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,000
because there's a lot

481
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
of situations where, like,

482
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
if you're level 100,

483
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,000
like, Blood Harvest

484
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
might be a lot of fun,

485
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
but Blood Harvest

486
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,000
is still dropping, like,

487
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
iPower 900 items for you.

488
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And at that point,

489
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
why would you want

490
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
to keep even Blood Harvest,

491
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
which players really love,

492
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
like, why would you want

493
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,000
to keep engaging with it

494
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
if you can't get

495
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
really good endgame items

496
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,000
format?

497
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So now when you're, like,

498
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
at level 100

499
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and you're playing

500
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,000
in Helltide

501
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
or if you're going

502
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,000
through Nightmare Dungeons

503
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
at, like, a regular,

504
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
like, a slightly lower tier

505
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and you're fighting

506
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
level 100 monsters

507
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,000
or higher,

508
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
you're always getting

509
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
iPower 925 items.

510
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
They might not have

511
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
all exactly the stats

512
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
or exactly the rolls

513
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,000
that you want,

514
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
but you're always getting

515
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
stuff you could actually

516
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
potentially use.

517
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah, a lot of the things

518
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
feel a lot better, too,

519
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
like gambling, right?

520
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Like, now gambling

521
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
is actually a really

522
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,000
great source

523
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
for targeting item slot

524
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
because all of those

525
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
are 925 at level 100.

526
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That's right.

527
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So, like, the ovals

528
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
that you've been sitting on,

529
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
where you go and you just

530
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
churn through a whole bunch

531
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
of these at once.

532
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They didn't have

533
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
as much generic value.

534
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Now they're a lot better

535
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,000
because you really can

536
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
just, like, say,

537
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I am looking for a helmet.

538
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I am looking for a ring.

539
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And you can just go roll,

540
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
you know, 10 iPower 925 rings

541
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
in a row.

542
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And you have stuff

543
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000
to play with then

544
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
at that point.

545
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So, yeah, those were

546
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
some of the high-level

547
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
changes we wanted to make

548
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
with items with regards

549
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
to, like, making it easier

550
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
to compare these things.

551
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Codex hits a lot.

552
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Like, a lot of the inventory

553
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
concerns that we'd have

554
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,000
made changes to gems

555
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
in previous seasons.

556
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We didn't have as many

557
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
of them clogging up

558
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
your inventory as well.

559
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So we thought that was

560
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
really, really good stuff.

561
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But then we knew

562
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
that we wanted to make sure

563
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that it wasn't just about

564
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
like, we weren't going to

565
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
add another tier

566
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
of iPower to items.

567
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That wasn't the way

568
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
to make itemization

569
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
more interesting for players.

570
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
and rewards more interesting.

571
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You know, one of the

572
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
core things that we really

573
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,000
want to focus around

574
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
was the idea that, like,

575
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
items have a journey.

576
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
The best items have a journey.

577
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Right?

578
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So when you get

579
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
a really good item,

580
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
it's about what the

581
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
potential of that item is.

582
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You know, what you can do

583
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,000
with this item

584
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
to make it really superior.

585
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Right?

586
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah, definitely.

587
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And that's sort of

588
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
to jump into tempering.

589
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah.

590
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
One of the first features

591
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
we had in terms of

592
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
taking your item

593
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000
on a journey

594
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
was this idea that

595
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
we wanted hundreds

596
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,000
of different affixes

597
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
and each one spoke

598
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
differently to a build.

599
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
We wanted you to be able

600
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
to play sort of

601
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
whatever class fantasy

602
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
or build fantasy

603
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,000
you had in mind

604
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and manifest that

605
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
through customization

606
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
of your items.

607
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So we actually have

608
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,000
some video, I think,

609
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
of what the tempering feature

610
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,000
looks like,

611
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and I can talk through

612
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
some of the updates

613
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
we've made from the PTR.

614
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So here you have,

615
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,000
you know,

616
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
we're adding an offensive

617
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
affix to the item.

618
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It's going to land on

619
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
increased corpse explosion damage.

620
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's like, yeah,

621
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
that's pretty cool,

622
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
especially if you really

623
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
like corpse explosion.

624
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
We've added a skip button

625
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
so you can skip through

626
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
the flow if you really

627
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
want to blast through this.

628
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
We also have a result screen

629
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,000
now that shows you

630
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
exactly what affix

631
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
it landed on

632
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
and what the roll range was.

633
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And then we have

634
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
some more exciting affixes

635
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
that you're going to see here.

636
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
For example,

637
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
chance to cast

638
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Bone Spear projectiles twice,

639
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
which I know, Adam,

640
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
is your favorite

641
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
because of all the

642
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
balance bomb

643
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
that dropped in your lap.

644
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Don't say it like that.

645
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It's so great.

646
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It is cool, though,

647
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,000
because he,

648
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
like, being able to, like,

649
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
oh, Derek is here.

650
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So, yeah,

651
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
we did our swap.

652
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But Joe's still

653
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,000
going to be here

654
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
off screen.

655
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,000
We just want to make sure

656
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
that Derek up here is here.

657
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Derek is our

658
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
lead season's designer.

659
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So he'll be

660
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
talking a little bit more

661
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
about Helltides later.

662
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Sorry to interject.

663
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Okay.

664
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Go ahead, Joe.

665
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So, yeah,

666
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
now I'm off screen.

667
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So, yeah,

668
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I think one of the

669
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
really cool things

670
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
about the tempering

671
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,000
system in general

672
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
is that, like,

673
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,000
the manuals

674
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
that we're introducing

675
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
initially are just,

676
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,000
like, the beginning

677
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
of what we can do

678
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
with tempering.

679
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's opportunities

680
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
to make, like,

681
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,000
really weird

682
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and interesting new

683
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
ethics is to kind of

684
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,000
throw at the player

685
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
that we can introduce

686
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
in seasons

687
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
or in other updates.

688
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So it's something

689
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,000
we can really extend

690
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
and do some really

691
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
neat stuff with.

692
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Yeah, we absolutely

693
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
plan to build a lot

694
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
in the future.

695
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yep.

696
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Awesome.

697
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, so a bunch

698
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,000
of improvements

699
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
to tempering overall.

700
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, and a lot

701
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
of these, again,

702
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
these improvements

703
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
in tempering

704
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
from the skip animations

705
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
to the previews

706
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,000
and stuff like that

707
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
that players will see

708
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
were based off

709
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,000
of feedback

710
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
that we actually got

711
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
from PTR.

712
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And so, again,

713
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
huge shout-out

714
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
to the community

715
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,000
for providing

716
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
all that feedback

717
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,000
for us

718
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
so that we can

719
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
actually get that in

720
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
before the launch

721
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,000
of Season 4.

722
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
But with tempering,

723
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
we also have

724
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Masterworking,

725
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
which is another

726
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,000
new feature

727
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
within Season 4

728
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and permanently

729
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
within Diablo 4 itself.

730
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So talk us through

731
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,000
a little bit

732
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
about what Masterworking

733
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
is and, of course,

734
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
the changes as well

735
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,000
that we're going

736
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
to be seeing

737
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
based off of PTR feedback.

738
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Sure, yeah.

739
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So, you know,

740
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
the next step

741
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
in your item's journey

742
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
is to really take

743
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
it to new heights.

744
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You've customized it.

745
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You found some base affixes

746
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
you're really into.

747
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And we want it

748
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
to give you a way

749
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
to essentially

750
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
take some of these affixes

751
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
to new levels.

752
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So you think about

753
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Helms and CDR

754
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
or Cooldown Reduction

755
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
or, for example,

756
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
that chance to replicate

757
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
your Bone Spear.

758
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
We want you to be able

759
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
to really juice those stats.

760
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So I think we have

761
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
a video here

762
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
of what that looks like.

763
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You know, overall,

764
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,000
what we've really done

765
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
is taken a look

766
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
at the feedback.

767
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
We got a bunch of feedback

768
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,000
that it was tedious

769
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
to upgrade these

770
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
over and over.

771
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So we've removed

772
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the animation

773
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
from ranks 1 through 3.

774
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
We've kept

775
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
the critical upgrade.

776
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
We have the animation

777
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,000
still there,

778
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
but you can skip it.

779
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You know, again,

780
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,000
sort of in the spirit

781
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
of blasting

782
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
across everything

783
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,000
that we do.

784
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So we can do that

785
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,000
very quickly.

786
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And another piece

787
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
of feedback

788
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
that we got

789
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
was that, you know,

790
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
part of the master

791
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
working process

792
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
allows you to reset this.

793
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And why do you want

794
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
to reset this?

795
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's because you want

796
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
to hit that specific affix

797
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
you're looking for.

798
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You want to juice

799
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
to specific affix.

800
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And sometimes

801
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
you might miss, right?

802
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Which means you want

803
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
to reset that item.

804
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yeah.

805
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So part of the resetting

806
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
sort of requires you

807
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
to get lower tier materials.

808
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You're going to get

809
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,000
these from the pit.

810
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
We'll talk about

811
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
that a little bit later.

812
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But overall,

813
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
we saw a bunch

814
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,000
of feedback

815
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
that was really tedious

816
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
to create like

817
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
a thousand caches

818
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
and open up them

819
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
in town like

820
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
a hundred times, right?

821
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's super annoying.

822
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The town is lava.

823
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
We want to address that.

824
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Right.

825
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So, you know,

826
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
we've added multiple scales

827
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
of material conversion

828
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
to those caches.

829
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
This is a short-term solution.

830
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,000
We have something

831
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
in the future planned.

832
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's just not ready yet.

833
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So, you know,

834
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
while it's not

835
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,000
the perfect solution,

836
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
it does get you there

837
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
a little bit quicker.

838
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
There's multiple conversion

839
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
rates of materials

840
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
so you can turn,

841
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
you know,

842
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
one legendary material

843
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
into a much higher

844
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
count of materials

845
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
based on the tiers

846
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,000
that we have

847
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
in that crafting system.

848
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So, again,

849
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
not the perfect solution.

850
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We have something

851
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
coming in a future update.

852
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Cool.

853
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Awesome.

854
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So, yeah,

855
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
a lot of changes

856
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
coming for masterworking

857
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
based off of feedback.

858
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Masterworking,

859
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
of course,

860
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
being a brand new

861
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
kind of that end tale

862
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
of that item journey

863
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
that you'll have

864
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
even after tempering

865
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
and stuff like that.

866
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So, yeah.

867
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'd say another thing

868
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
that was brought to you

869
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
was about Veiled Crystals,

870
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,000
right?

871
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Didn't we reduce

872
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
the amount that you need

873
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,000
for crafting?

874
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We did.

875
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We did.

876
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And I can totally talk

877
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
about some of the stuff

878
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,000
we've done just overall

879
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
on itemization.

880
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Veiled Crystals

881
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
is one of those things.

882
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah,

883
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
so I'll talk about...

884
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,000
First,

885
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I want to touch on

886
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
rare and magic items.

887
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That was something

888
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
we made a change

889
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
from Season 3

890
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and Season 4.

891
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Legendary items

892
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
are just generally

893
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
straight up better

894
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,000
than rare items now.

895
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And part of our goal

896
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
there is really

897
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
to ensure that players

898
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
aren't sifting through sand

899
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
looking through thousands

900
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
of items.

901
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
We want to just call it out,

902
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
like legendary items

903
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,000
are legendary.

904
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
At the same time,

905
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,000
we acknowledge that

906
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
there is some coolness

907
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
to knowing that certain

908
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
magic and rare items

909
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
could have value to you.

910
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
We don't have anything

911
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
for Season 4 yet,

912
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,000
but the design team

913
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
is definitely talking

914
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
about ways that we can

915
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
bring this rarity back

916
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
in a way that doesn't

917
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
diminish our overall goal

918
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
of trying to reduce

919
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,000
that sort of sifting

920
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
through sand feeling.

921
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So in the meantime,

922
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
they can be salvaged.

923
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
They still have a use

924
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,000
in the endgame,

925
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,000
but we heard a ton

926
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
of feedback,

927
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
to your point, Adam,

928
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
on the Veiled Crystals.

929
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It's just such a bottleneck

930
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
and it's like,

931
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,000
goddammit,

932
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I have to pick a bunch

933
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
of yellow items up

934
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
to do any of the

935
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
cool crafting features.

936
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,000
What the hell, Blizzard?

937
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That's an actual

938
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
player quote, too.

939
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Yeah, I'm very sure it was.

940
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Yeah, so what we've done

941
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
is we've made it

942
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
so that legendaries

943
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,000
break down into

944
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
equal amounts of

945
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Veiled Crystals,

946
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,000
so you can just not

947
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
pick up yellow items.

948
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It's just a bonus now.

949
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,000
We've also made

950
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
sacred and ancestral items

951
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
break down into

952
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
two and three

953
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
amounts of salvage.

954
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So sacred items

955
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,000
will break down into

956
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
double,

957
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
ancestral,

958
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,000
break down,

959
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
and triple.

960
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So we're effectively

961
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,000
tripling the output

962
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
of a lot of the salvage here.

963
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And I know,

964
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
so, one,

965
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
that was probably

966
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
the most vocal feedback

967
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
that we got from players.

968
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Maybe a little bit.

969
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Yeah, but I need

970
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
more Veiled Crystals,

971
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
so I know that there's

972
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
changes coming for that

973
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
in Season 4

974
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
based off that PTR feedback.

975
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Another,

976
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
probably maybe the second,

977
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
maybe also the first,

978
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
topmost,

979
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
our largest feedback piece

980
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
that we got

981
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
is around greater affixes

982
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
and the visibility

983
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
related to those.

984
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So there are changes

985
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
going into that

986
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
for Season 4.

987
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So, Fawn,

988
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,000
do you want to talk

989
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
a little bit about that?

990
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yeah, we wanted,

991
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000
you know,

992
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
the dopamine.

993
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
That was a big goal also

994
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
of part of itemization

995
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,000
is just like seeing

996
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
an item hit the ground

997
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
and just be like,

998
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
oh, I like that jackpot moment.

999
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah, that's really important.

1000
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So we actually have

1001
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,000
some video here

1002
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
to show of what

1003
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,000
that actually looks like

1004
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
on the ground.

1005
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So you can see,

1006
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
here's the weirdly

1007
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
long named item.

1008
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
with the greater affix.

1009
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm yielding commander

1010
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
sacrificial sickle.

1011
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I know, right?

1012
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

1013
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So we have

1014
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
one greater affix star.

1015
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It'll go up to 3

1016
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
or 4

1017
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
if it's a unique item,

1018
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
which always feels incredible.

1019
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So it shows up

1020
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,000
on the ground

1021
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
when it lands.

1022
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And then if we can

1023
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
go to the next video,

1024
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
we actually have

1025
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
an indicator now

1026
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
when it is

1027
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
in the inventory.

1028
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah, so you can see it.

1029
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,000
What a zoom.

1030
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It's a trade enhance.

1031
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I asked this as a joke

1032
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and it looks so good.

1033
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I'm so happy.

1034
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I'm disappointed.

1035
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I can't see the pixels.

1036
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's not zoomed in.

1037
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So that's been

1038
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
enormously helpful

1039
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
and really,

1040
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,000
you know,

1041
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
when you kill like Durial

1042
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
or one of these

1043
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
tormented bosses

1044
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and they drop a ton

1045
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
of loot on the ground

1046
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
to see some of these

1047
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
have stars on them

1048
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and it just

1049
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
is a feel-great moment.

1050
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Yeah.

1051
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Kind of goes with the whole

1052
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
like not sifting

1053
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
through the sands.

1054
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You clearly see that icon

1055
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,000
and you know

1056
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
that it has value to you.

1057
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You want to know

1058
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
what's valuable.

1059
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Exactly.

1060
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Especially, again,

1061
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
even on the icon itself.

1062
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
like in your inventory

1063
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
you will immediately know

1064
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
those are my greater

1065
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
affix items

1066
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
and long gone

1067
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,000
are the days

1068
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
of the Roman numeral.

1069
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Right.

1070
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Even like the designers

1071
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,000
of the show.

1072
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It's funny.

1073
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I think internally

1074
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
we knew like

1075
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
oh, that's probably

1076
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
going to be changed.

1077
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
We had a few jokes

1078
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
about that.

1079
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Sure.

1080
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
One thing I want to touch on

1081
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
real quick before I move on

1082
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
to itemization

1083
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
if that's okay

1084
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
is we actually

1085
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
to touch on the

1086
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Veiled Crystals

1087
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I think players

1088
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,000
are going to want to know

1089
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
this is we reduced

1090
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
the imprinting cost

1091
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
of aspects quite a bit.

1092
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That's really going to

1093
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
help the Veiled Crystals

1094
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,000
as well.

1095
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think it went from

1096
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
like 75 Veiled Crystals

1097
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to imprints

1098
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
on an Ancestral Armor

1099
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to 16.

1100
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah, that's huge.

1101
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's a pretty huge swing.

1102
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You're just getting

1103
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
way more of your aspects

1104
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,000
on here.

1105
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
It's a lot more flexible.

1106
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
We really want people

1107
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,000
to feel like

1108
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
and this is kind of

1109
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
the Codex of Power Updates

1110
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000
in general

1111
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
which I'm really pumped about

1112
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
is we want you to feel

1113
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,000
like you're able

1114
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
to re-imprint those aspects

1115
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
and it's something

1116
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,000
that you're not

1117
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
having a huge cost

1118
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
or huge barriers

1119
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000
to doing

1120
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
because as you

1121
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
upgrade your gear

1122
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,000
that should be part

1123
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
of your process

1124
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
is like putting on

1125
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,000
their favorite affixes.

1126
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Yeah.

1127
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So a lot of changes

1128
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
coming with tempering,

1129
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
masterworking,

1130
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,000
itemization

1131
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and I know

1132
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
did we have any other

1133
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
changes that you wanted

1134
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:07,000
to cover before

1135
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
we move on

1136
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
to the next section?

1137
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Colin's got this

1138
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
like this novel

1139
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
in front of him

1140
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,000
and he's like

1141
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
what am I going to

1142
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
do you want to re-imprint?

1143
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Oh, one I think

1144
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
is worth mentioning

1145
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Colin you may want

1146
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
to talk about

1147
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
is the masterworking.

1148
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I remember we got

1149
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
a lot of feedback

1150
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
about the failchance.

1151
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Oh, that's a great point.

1152
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh yeah, that's true.

1153
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Funny enough

1154
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
that was like

1155
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
probably the biggest thing

1156
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,000
changed.

1157
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1158
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That was the first bullet

1159
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and I somehow missed it.

1160
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah, so we

1161
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
definitely felt like

1162
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
there's a ton of feedback

1163
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
that the double random

1164
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
chance was just

1165
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
a little bit too much

1166
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
and we agreed

1167
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
so we just took it out.

1168
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It's just fun now

1169
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
just to upgrade the item.

1170
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
We adjusted the material

1171
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
costs a bit

1172
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
but the failchance

1173
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
is no longer there.

1174
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Yeah, awesome.

1175
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Cool.

1176
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Well, thank you Colin

1177
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
for going through

1178
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,000
those changes.

1179
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
We'll actually be back

1180
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
to Colin here later

1181
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
because he still has more

1182
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
to talk about

1183
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
from his novel

1184
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
papers that he has

1185
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
to be prepared.

1186
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
But we did want

1187
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,000
to jump into

1188
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
some of the

1189
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
class balance changes

1190
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
that are coming

1191
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
after PTR

1192
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
of course

1193
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
with season 4

1194
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
we have a lot

1195
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
of class balance changes

1196
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
that are on top

1197
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,000
of all these

1198
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
itemization changes

1199
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
and we got a lot

1200
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,000
of great feedback

1201
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
from players

1202
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
so Mr. Adam Jackson

1203
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,000
very much did.

1204
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Let's run through these.

1205
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Yeah, so basically

1206
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,000
The classic

1207
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Adam Jackson slides.

1208
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Yes, I love my slides.

1209
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
We have got three categories

1210
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,000
of things

1211
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
that I'm going to be

1212
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,000
talking about today.

1213
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Again, thanks to everybody

1214
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
for playing on the PTR

1215
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
we did get a ton of feedback.

1216
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I'm not going to go over

1217
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,000
the specifics

1218
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
of everything that changed

1219
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
but I'm going to go over

1220
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
kind of the categories

1221
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,000
of things

1222
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
just because there's

1223
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
a whole lot of changes.

1224
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
One of the first big ones

1225
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
was endgame survivability issues.

1226
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So this is kind of

1227
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
talking about those people

1228
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,000
that went really far

1229
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
into the pit

1230
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and this is kind of

1231
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,000
something that's been

1232
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
happening online as well

1233
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
that we wanted to address

1234
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and there's this phenomenon

1235
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
when you get really deep

1236
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
into the game

1237
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and you're fighting

1238
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
high level monsters

1239
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
where you'll hit a point

1240
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,000
where the monsters

1241
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
are kind of easy

1242
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
and you're able to blow through

1243
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
with your really powerful builds

1244
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
and then you kind of get

1245
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
to a point where

1246
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
they start one-shotting you

1247
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and it can be kind of mysterious

1248
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and hard to understand

1249
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,000
like what's going on

1250
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
why did this happen?

1251
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
We've also had some issues

1252
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
balancing that kind of

1253
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
top end survivability

1254
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
when you get to those

1255
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
hard monsters in the game.

1256
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
One of the reasons for this

1257
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
is that variability

1258
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
and player defensiveness

1259
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
has been really high

1260
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
traditionally.

1261
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
This is why

1262
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
when you look at

1263
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
the new items in the game

1264
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
in Season 4

1265
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
you don't see

1266
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
a damage reduction

1267
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
very much at all.

1268
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's a very premium stat now

1269
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
that's really hard to get

1270
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and it's to help solve

1271
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
this problem

1272
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
of when someone is stacking

1273
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
all damage reduction

1274
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
versus someone who has

1275
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
none of it

1276
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
their difference

1277
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
in effective health

1278
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and survivability

1279
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
is really really high

1280
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
and so it makes it hard

1281
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
to balance the game.

1282
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Another part that we wanted

1283
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
to hit was really armor.

1284
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
That armor is kind of

1285
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
a really confusing stat.

1286
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It's not really well

1287
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,000
understood how it works

1288
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and I'm going to be

1289
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
going over in a little bit

1290
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,000
how it works

1291
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and what we're changing

1292
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
to kind of address

1293
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
both of these issues

1294
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,000
a little bit.

1295
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Next is that some stats

1296
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
can get really high.

1297
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
We added all these

1298
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
crazy awesome stats

1299
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
and you can juice them

1300
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,000
with master working

1301
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
and crit them

1302
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
and all these things

1303
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
and it allowed for some

1304
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
really crazy things

1305
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
on the PTR

1306
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
which people love

1307
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
to post constantly at me

1308
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and to be clear

1309
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
we like crazy things.

1310
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It's awesome to get powerful

1311
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
and have that fantasy.

1312
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
We do have to take

1313
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,000
into account things

1314
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
like combat clarity

1315
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
and computer performance

1316
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
to make sure that

1317
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
the game can still run

1318
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
very well for everybody

1319
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
so we made some changes

1320
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000
there to adjust that.

1321
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,000
You mean it's not fun

1322
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
to just not see

1323
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
the screen or the ground?

1324
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I think it was

1325
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
for a little while.

1326
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
It is hilarious I think.

1327
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's funny for a bit

1328
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
but you can always see

1329
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
patches of ground

1330
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and one player can do that

1331
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
let alone when you get

1332
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
four of them in a group.

1333
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's great.

1334
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And last but not least

1335
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
balance changes

1336
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
and bug fixes

1337
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I'll be going over

1338
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
some of them

1339
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
but there's way more

1340
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
than what I'm covering

1341
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,000
right now today

1342
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
but just know

1343
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
we took a lot of feedback

1344
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
on balance

1345
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
a lot of feedback

1346
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,000
on bugs

1347
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
there were a lot of them

1348
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
that were reported

1349
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and we acted on a lot of them

1350
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and I'll give an example

1351
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
of some that we did.

1352
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Alright so let's go

1353
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
into armor.

1354
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
So brief history

1355
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,000
lesson or description

1356
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
of how armor works today.

1357
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
This is like when you log in

1358
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
how armor is functioning.

1359
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's your staff

1360
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
for physical damage mitigation

1361
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,000
so you know how you have

1362
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
your elemental resistance

1363
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
that caps at 75

1364
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
and then can get pushed up

1365
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
a little bit.

1366
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Armor reduces your physical resistance

1367
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
up to a cap of 85%.

1368
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
It can't go higher than that

1369
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,000
that's the number

1370
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
but what's confusing

1371
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
is the amount of armor

1372
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
that you need

1373
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
to get to that 85% cap

1374
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
is actually based on

1375
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
the level of the monster

1376
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
that you're fighting

1377
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
and I gave some examples here

1378
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
these are the actual numbers

1379
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
in the game.

1380
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
So if you have a level 50 monster

1381
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,000
that's hitting you

1382
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
you know whacking you

1383
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
then you need 5,265 armor

1384
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and then you'll be at

1385
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
that 85% cap

1386
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
but then at level 100

1387
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,000
at every level

1388
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
you know like 51, 52, 53

1389
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
that number is going up

1390
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,000
of what you need

1391
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and at level 100

1392
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,000
it's about you know

1393
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
9,230

1394
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and then at level 150 monster

1395
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
it gets close to 13,000

1396
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,000
right?

1397
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And so what this ends up

1398
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
you know kind of creating

1399
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,000
is that the player

1400
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
really never knows

1401
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
when they're done

1402
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
with armor right?

1403
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
That number can scale up forever.

1404
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's kind of a hidden system

1405
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,000
under the hood

1406
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
so when you're fighting

1407
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
these monsters

1408
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
and they get way higher level

1409
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
than you

1410
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
as you scale into the pit

1411
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
or nightmare dungeons

1412
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,000
or whatever

1413
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
you don't really know

1414
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
how much you need

1415
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and so this is kind of

1416
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
really contributing

1417
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,000
to that phenomenon

1418
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
where you're fine

1419
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,000
you're at the cap

1420
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
and then you're

1421
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,000
you know

1422
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
the higher level monsters

1423
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
just start one-shotting you.

1424
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So in season 4

1425
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
a lot of it's going to be

1426
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
the same as season 3

1427
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
it's still going to be

1428
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,000
your source of

1429
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
physical damage mitigation

1430
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
the cap is still going

1431
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
to be 85%

1432
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and you're still going to need

1433
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
escalating amounts of armor

1434
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
as the monster level

1435
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
gets higher

1436
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
but what we're changing here

1437
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
if we go forward a little bit

1438
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
is that armor is now

1439
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
going to cap

1440
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
at that level 100 monster number

1441
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
so that 9,230

1442
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
you can write down this number

1443
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
we're also going to later

1444
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
get into the tool tip

1445
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
we couldn't get it in

1446
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
for the launch of season 4

1447
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
but we'll have it soon after

1448
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
but it's kind of going to be

1449
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
like elemental resistance

1450
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
where you get to this number

1451
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
and then you're kind of

1452
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
done with the system

1453
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,000
right?

1454
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
So armor is just another thing

1455
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,000
on your checkbox

1456
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
of things you want to do

1457
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
as far as defensive survivability

1458
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
and once you get it

1459
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
you're done

1460
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
you can get it from gear

1461
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
legendary aspects

1462
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and so on

1463
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
particularly in season 4

1464
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I think this will be

1465
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
a little bit of an easy

1466
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
number to hit

1467
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
we're not trying to make

1468
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
this super difficult

1469
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
or hard to do

1470
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
it'll be very achievable

1471
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
for you

1472
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
when you're a level 100 player

1473
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
so here we have a zoom in

1474
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
on the tool tip

1475
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
so you can see

1476
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
this player has

1477
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
way above that 9,000

1478
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
amount of armor

1479
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,000
that they need

1480
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
they have close to 16,000

1481
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
but you can see there

1482
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
it's capped out

1483
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
at that 85%

1484
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
physical resistance

1485
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
and again

1486
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
soon after the launch

1487
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,000
of season 4

1488
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
we're going to actually

1489
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
put the cap that you need

1490
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
of the number

1491
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,000
that you're chasing

1492
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
because we want you

1493
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
to know what the goal

1494
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
is that you're trying to hit

1495
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
so that means

1496
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
they have a lot of room

1497
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,000
for optimization

1498
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
correct

1499
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
yeah

1500
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,000
this means that

1501
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
this player

1502
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
can actually give up

1503
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
armor on some of their

1504
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
tempering or item affixes

1505
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
and look for other stats

1506
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
like that's kind of the point

1507
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
so next

1508
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
stat caps

1509
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
so you know

1510
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
now that we've introduced

1511
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
a lot of ways

1512
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
to get really high amounts

1513
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
of stats in the game

1514
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
we want to kind of

1515
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
control for visual clarity

1516
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
you know

1517
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
what a player

1518
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
can put onto their screen

1519
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
so kind of similar

1520
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000
to some caps

1521
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
we have already

1522
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,000
in the game

1523
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
like attack speed

1524
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
or elemental resistance

1525
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
we're putting some caps

1526
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
on cooldown reduction

1527
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
and the increased area size

1528
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,000
you know

1529
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
like it's really fun

1530
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
to get those giant

1531
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,000
frost novas

1532
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
that cover the screen

1533
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
but when it goes

1534
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,000
like two or three

1535
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
screenings away

1536
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
it can get really

1537
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
noisy and messy

1538
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
so we still want

1539
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,000
these stats to be

1540
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
really powerful

1541
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and impactful

1542
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
but just control

1543
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
a little bit

1544
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
the amount of insanity

1545
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
that they can bring

1546
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
and one thing

1547
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
on this cooldown reduction

1548
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
cap

1549
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,000
to be clear

1550
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
this is not just

1551
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
CDR across the entire game

1552
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,000
this is just capping

1553
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
what you can get

1554
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
from gear

1555
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
so this is like

1556
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
the base cooldown reduction

1557
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
you get when you first

1558
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
cast a skill

1559
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
what it's going to be

1560
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
you can still get

1561
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
cooldown resets

1562
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
or additional cooldown effects

1563
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
from things like

1564
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,000
the skill tree

1565
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
or legendary powers

1566
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,000
that just reduce

1567
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
the cooldown of your skills

1568
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
as you do certain mechanics

1569
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
this is just like

1570
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
the baseline cap

1571
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
that comes from your gear

1572
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I think when we looked

1573
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
at the cap for area effect

1574
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
too we tested it

1575
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
on frost nova

1576
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and we were like

1577
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
pretty meticulous

1578
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
on what that cap

1579
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,000
should be

1580
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
and it was still massive

1581
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
no it's huge

1582
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,000
yeah

1583
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
when I say like

1584
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
making a cap

1585
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,000
you're still going

1586
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
to get to insanity

1587
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
when it comes to

1588
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
what's on your screen

1589
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,000
it's still going to be awesome

1590
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
so you can see here

1591
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
this is just showing you

1592
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
what the tool tip

1593
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,000
looks like now

1594
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
so we're going to be

1595
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,000
showing you

1596
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
as a player

1597
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
what those caps are

1598
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
so you know

1599
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
when you're evaluating

1600
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,000
your gear

1601
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
on your tool tips

1602
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000
what it is

1603
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
and then same thing here

1604
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,000
you can see here

1605
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
like the dust level

1606
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
area effect size bonus

1607
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
it caps at 100%

1608
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
next balance updates

1609
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
so again

1610
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
like I mentioned before

1611
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,000
we made a lot of

1612
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
balance changes

1613
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
based on feedback

1614
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
again thank you

1615
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
for playing

1616
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
and giving us

1617
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,000
all that feedback

1618
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I'm going to go over

1619
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
some of the things

1620
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
one of the bigger

1621
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
categories of things

1622
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
was again

1623
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:33,000
like I mentioned

1624
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
those changes

1625
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
due to combat readability

1626
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and balancing player power

1627
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
a few examples here

1628
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
of things that we're reducing

1629
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
are like the amount

1630
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
of dust levels

1631
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
that can be on your screen

1632
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
and fractured winter glass

1633
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
one of my new favorite

1634
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
uniques we're bringing in

1635
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
the amount of

1636
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,000
frozen orbs

1637
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
that could span the screen

1638
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
is going to be reduced a bit

1639
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
so I want to prepare you all

1640
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,000
for that

1641
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
again to be clear

1642
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
you're still going to spawn

1643
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
a whole lot

1644
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
it's just not going to be

1645
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
like insane amounts

1646
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
where you can't see things anymore

1647
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
they're still going to be

1648
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
very powerful

1649
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm even going to show

1650
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
a video a little bit later

1651
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of kind of the difference

1652
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
of PTR

1653
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
to what's going to ship

1654
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,000
in the game

1655
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
some other things

1656
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,000
that we're doing

1657
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
fortify

1658
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
we wanted to increase

1659
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
the amount of damage reduction

1660
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
that you get

1661
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
this is just fortify

1662
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,000
across the board

1663
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
the base mechanic

1664
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
that DR is going

1665
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
from 10 to 15%

1666
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
and this is because

1667
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
before when it was at 10%

1668
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
we had to take into account

1669
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
that players could get

1670
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,000
damage reduction

1671
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
from a million different sources

1672
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
throughout the game

1673
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
now that it's more rare

1674
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
and more premium

1675
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
we can actually make

1676
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
this mechanic in the game

1677
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
a little bit more impactful

1678
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
and feel like you're

1679
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
a tankier player

1680
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
for opting into this

1681
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
these kinds of builds

1682
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
we also made a lot of

1683
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
tempering affix updates

1684
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I'm not going to go

1685
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
into detail them

1686
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,000
but just know

1687
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
what you saw in PTR

1688
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and what's going to ship

1689
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
you're going to see

1690
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,000
a lot of improvements

1691
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
a lot of balance changes

1692
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
even some shuffling around

1693
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
of the affixes

1694
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
to make them

1695
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
in ways that make more sense

1696
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
based on feedback

1697
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
and then we did do

1698
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
some class changes as well

1699
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'm only going to give

1700
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
very few examples here

1701
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
but just know that

1702
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
there were quite a few

1703
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
one is druid players

1704
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
companion druid players

1705
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
always harass me

1706
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
they want that build to work

1707
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
and I agree

1708
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,000
it's really cool

1709
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
so we increased

1710
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
the health of druid wolves

1711
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
by 200%

1712
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,000
and we also reduced

1713
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
the respawn rate

1714
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
and cut it in half

1715
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
so we got feedback

1716
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
basically that

1717
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
their companions

1718
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
were really good and fun

1719
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
and did damage

1720
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
but in the late game

1721
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000
they just kind of died

1722
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
and couldn't survive

1723
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
so we're doing this

1724
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,000
to kind of address

1725
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
that feedback

1726
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
alright so here's

1727
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
dust devils as an example

1728
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
so you can see on the left

1729
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
this is just one barbarian

1730
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
by themselves

1731
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
the amount of dust devils

1732
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
that they could produce

1733
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,000
right

1734
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
and then on the right

1735
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
you can see

1736
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
kind of the same barbarian

1737
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,000
you can see like

1738
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
the dust devils

1739
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
around the areas

1740
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
where the enemies are

1741
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
they're still getting hit

1742
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,000
by a ton of them

1743
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
but it's not covering

1744
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
the entire screen

1745
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
right

1746
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,000
especially when you get

1747
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
like three four

1748
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
many players together

1749
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
it really becomes insanity

1750
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,000
yeah

1751
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
when you're in a party

1752
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
of four barbs

1753
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,000
or

1754
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
you know

1755
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
it's just like

1756
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
everyone's a barb

1757
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
and I don't know

1758
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,000
where I'm walking

1759
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
yeah

1760
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,000
in other classes

1761
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
they do that kind of thing too

1762
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
not just barb

1763
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
but this was kind of

1764
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
a good example

1765
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,000
so you know

1766
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
this is kind of

1767
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,000
seeing the difference

1768
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
between PTR and live

1769
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
and then next

1770
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
we have another class change

1771
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
so Scoundrel's Kiss

1772
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
this is another one

1773
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
of our new uniques

1774
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
that Rogue Players

1775
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
gave us a lot of feedback on

1776
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
so a quick summary

1777
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
of how this new unique works

1778
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
is it kind of changes

1779
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
your rapid fire skill

1780
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
from shooting straight

1781
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
and hitting a single enemy

1782
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
into kind of a mortar skill

1783
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
where you shoot up

1784
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,000
into the air

1785
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
and then your arrows

1786
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,000
fall on the ground

1787
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
and explode

1788
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
it's really really cool

1789
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,000
but one of the pieces

1790
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
of feedback we got

1791
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
was that when you

1792
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
launched the arrows

1793
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
they would kind of

1794
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,000
go in a line

1795
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
and they wouldn't all

1796
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
hit the same enemy anymore

1797
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
so if you were trying

1798
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
to do single target damage

1799
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
it could actually be a nerf

1800
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
unless you like

1801
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,000
walked right up

1802
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
to the enemies

1803
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
and shotgun them

1804
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
and while there was

1805
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
a way to play around it

1806
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
you know

1807
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
players weren't really happy

1808
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
that like we transformed

1809
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
the skill so much

1810
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,000
that it went from

1811
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
a range skill

1812
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
to kind of a melee skill

1813
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
so we made an update here

1814
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and we have a video

1815
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
of the before and after

1816
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
but basically

1817
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
you can see on the PTR

1818
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
on the left here

1819
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,000
how you know

1820
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
it goes in a big line

1821
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
and then the player

1822
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
has to run right next

1823
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
to the target dummy

1824
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
to do the full damage to it

1825
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
and on the right now

1826
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,000
you'll see

1827
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
basically you target

1828
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
where those arrows

1829
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
are going to drop

1830
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,000
and they just all

1831
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
go to that area

1832
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
so you can hit

1833
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,000
a single enemy

1834
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
but you'll also

1835
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
hit all the enemies

1836
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,000
around it

1837
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
because the arrows explode

1838
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
so it should be

1839
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,000
a lot more usable

1840
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
compared to before

1841
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
can Scandals kiss

1842
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
ricochet with my rapid fire?

1843
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I'm pretty sure

1844
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
yes it can

1845
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
so it does all the things

1846
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
and inherits all the things

1847
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
that your rapid fire

1848
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,000
doesn't say

1849
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
that's very cool

1850
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
but can it double projectile?

1851
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm pretty sure it can

1852
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
just like everything else

1853
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,000
yes

1854
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
yes

1855
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
spam everywhere

1856
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,000
yes

1857
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
we love spam

1858
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
and last but not least

1859
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
bug fixes

1860
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
like I mentioned before

1861
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
there were a whole lot

1862
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
of bug fixes reported to us

1863
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
thank you all for getting them

1864
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
we addressed pretty much

1865
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
every single one

1866
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
that was reported

1867
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm giving some examples here

1868
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
but again we got a lot more

1869
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
than what I'm showing

1870
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,000
on the screen

1871
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
one was Druid's Hurricane

1872
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
was incorrectly scaling damage

1873
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,000
basically infinitely

1874
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
so we fixed that

1875
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Ebon Piercer

1876
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
the extra missiles

1877
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
from our new unique

1878
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
they incorrectly

1879
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
had a 100% lucky hit chance

1880
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
which is proccing

1881
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
a lot of crazy stuff

1882
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and then Flame Weaver

1883
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
another one of the new things

1884
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,000
we introduced to the game

1885
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
it's basically an effect

1886
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
where you can put a firewall

1887
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
on the ground

1888
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
and then you shoot firebolts through

1889
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
and it'll split the firebolts

1890
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
really cool fantasy

1891
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
but what happened

1892
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
in the PTR

1893
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,000
was you could stack

1894
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
a bunch of firewalls

1895
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
right on top of each other

1896
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and they would split

1897
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
the firebolts multiplicatively

1898
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
and add more and more

1899
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
way more than intended

1900
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
so you could fire

1901
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
a ridiculous number

1902
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
of firebolts

1903
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
which were crashing servers

1904
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
and things

1905
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
so it wasn't great

1906
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
but now we fixed that

1907
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
so it'll work properly

1908
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
and again

1909
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
we're still discovering

1910
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
and working on other fixes

1911
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
there were a lot more

1912
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
that went in

1913
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
if you reported it

1914
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
it was very likely fixed

1915
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
so basically

1916
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
the build will be

1917
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
in a much better

1918
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
stable state

1919
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
once we launch

1920
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
and that's really

1921
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
due to all your feedback

1922
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,000
so thanks again

1923
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
awesome

1924
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
that's my section

1925
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
a lot of changes

1926
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,000
coming to classes

1927
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
class balance feedback

1928
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
we got from PTR

1929
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
was really really great

1930
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
able to make

1931
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
so many different

1932
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
changes

1933
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,000
there

1934
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,000
of course

1935
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
some of the biggest ones

1936
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
like the readability stuff

1937
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
that we probably saw

1938
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
seeing the initial videos

1939
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
of the dust devils

1940
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,000
everywhere

1941
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
was crazy

1942
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
also being in a party

1943
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I was playing PTR

1944
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
and being in a party

1945
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
with two barbs

1946
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
and another necromancer

1947
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I was like

1948
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
oh okay

1949
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
what's going on right now

1950
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,000
yeah

1951
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
PTR is

1952
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,000
one of those things

1953
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
you get to see things

1954
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
in development state

1955
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I will say

1956
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,000
these kinds of things

1957
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
are actually pretty common

1958
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
when we're developing anything

1959
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
is being able to create

1960
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
these crazy situations

1961
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
and we have to fix it

1962
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,000
for the game

1963
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
before it goes live

1964
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
so that's kind of

1965
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
the advantage of PTR

1966
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
is players can find

1967
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,000
these things

1968
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
there's a lot more manpower

1969
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,000
being put in

1970
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
PTR was super great

1971
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
for us to have

1972
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
and thanks again

1973
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,000
to the community

1974
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
for the feedback

1975
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
on all the class balance changes

1976
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
and thanks Adam

1977
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
for walking us through that

1978
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
the next thing

1979
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
we do want to talk about

1980
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
is with Derek over here

1981
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Derek is actually going to

1982
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
talk a little bit about

1983
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
of course all the immense

1984
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Helltide changes

1985
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,000
probably one of the most

1986
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
popular features

1987
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
and changes that we've

1988
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
introduced in season 4

1989
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
with PTR

1990
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:46,000
and people being able

1991
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
to experience it

1992
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
of course we got feedback

1993
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
based off of players

1994
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
jumping into Helltide

1995
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
and we do want to go

1996
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
through all that with Derek

1997
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
and then we also want to

1998
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
talk a little bit about

1999
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
the season itself

2000
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,000
with Derek

2001
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
so Derek

2002
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
want to jump in?

2003
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
yeah just a few things

2004
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
to cover

2005
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
yeah so as you mentioned

2006
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
the players who joined us

2007
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,000
when the PTR

2008
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
or caught all the various

2009
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
like blog and video posts

2010
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and whatnot

2011
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
know that with season 4

2012
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
we're introducing

2013
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
permanent upgrades

2014
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
to the Helltide experience

2015
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
heavy focus on improving

2016
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
and enhancing I guess

2017
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
monster density

2018
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
and activity variety

2019
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
so there's ton more

2020
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
things to do in the Helltides

2021
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and as a result

2022
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
there's just ton more

2023
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
monsters to you know

2024
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
mow through

2025
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
in the Helltides

2026
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
there's also

2027
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
some explorations

2028
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
and just to

2029
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
double back real quick

2030
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
these are all permanent

2031
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
across both the seasonal

2032
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
and eternal realms

2033
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
so they're not going away

2034
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
once season 4 ends

2035
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
this is just how

2036
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Helltide works

2037
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
it's part of the game

2038
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
kind of like our item updates

2039
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
too right

2040
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
this is the new world

2041
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,000
we live in

2042
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
this is sanctuary

2043
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
but there's also

2044
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
if you kind of look

2045
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,000
at the top right screen

2046
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
there's a threat system

2047
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
so the longer you're

2048
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
fighting in the tides

2049
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
you're going to be

2050
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
accumulating threat

2051
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
which just results

2052
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
in even more

2053
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
monsters ambushing you

2054
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
at higher frequencies

2055
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
than monster packs

2056
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I think the personal favorite

2057
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
and I think like fan favorite

2058
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
is the Hellworm

2059
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
you know this giant demon slug bug

2060
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
that just pops out

2061
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
from the ground

2062
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
and just vomits monsters

2063
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,000
all over you

2064
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
but you know

2065
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
kind of with all those

2066
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
the seasons

2067
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
as we say a lot

2068
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
are an amazing opportunity

2069
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
for experimentation

2070
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and sometimes

2071
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
the best results

2072
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
of those experimentations

2073
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
are when they can inspire

2074
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
permanent upgrades

2075
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
and just enhancements

2076
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
to the base game

2077
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,000
as a whole

2078
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
so that's where

2079
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
the Hellborn

2080
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and the new

2081
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Accursed Ritual

2082
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,000
and Blood Maiden

2083
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
come into play

2084
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
as part of the new

2085
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Helltad experience

2086
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
yeah look at those

2087
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,000
those look great

2088
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
so the Hellborn

2089
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
as our season 2 players

2090
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,000
might recall

2091
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
we introduced

2092
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
the Bloodseekers

2093
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,000
and those were

2094
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
really cool

2095
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,000
monsters

2096
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
based on

2097
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
class archetypes

2098
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
so you're kind of like

2099
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,000
fighting

2100
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
the Empiric Shadow

2101
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
versions of yourself

2102
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
and we take a look

2103
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
at that content

2104
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
and we just love it

2105
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
from like the team perspective

2106
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,000
and just find like

2107
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
hey we're upgrading

2108
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
the Helltides

2109
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
this is a perfect

2110
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
piece of content

2111
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
to just include with it

2112
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
so that's where

2113
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,000
the Hellborn

2114
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
came into play

2115
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:03,000
you know

2116
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
they're fallen heroes

2117
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
of Sanctuary

2118
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
they've been overtaken

2119
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
by the corruption

2120
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
from Hell

2121
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,000
and you know

2122
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
kind of turned against you

2123
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
kind of in line

2124
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,000
with that

2125
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
the Accursed Ritual

2126
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
and the Blood Maiden

2127
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
in season 2

2128
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
with the Bloodlurs

2129
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and the Bloodseekers

2130
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
we introduced this concept

2131
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
of

2132
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I guess calling it

2133
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,000
just like

2134
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
open world

2135
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
social boss summoning

2136
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
we followed up

2137
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,000
with like the

2138
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
yeah there's a buzzword

2139
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
there

2140
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
yeah it's very very

2141
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:28,000
yeah very catchy

2142
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
rules right out of time

2143
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I love it

2144
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
again to my designer

2145
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
speak sometimes

2146
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,000
but yeah

2147
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and we followed that up

2148
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:34,000
with like the

2149
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Malfus spawners

2150
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
in season 3

2151
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
and again

2152
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
looking at these

2153
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,000
really successful

2154
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
experimentations

2155
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
from previous seasons

2156
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
we love opportunities

2157
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
to bring players together

2158
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
and just add that

2159
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
extra out layer

2160
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
to the Helltide experience

2161
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
so that's where

2162
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
the Accursed Ritual

2163
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
comes into play

2164
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
so as you're

2165
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,000
out fighting

2166
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
against the tides

2167
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
you'll be collecting

2168
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,000
the new material

2169
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
the Baneful Hearts

2170
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
that you can bring

2171
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
to the Accursed Ritual

2172
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
it takes 3

2173
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
to summon up

2174
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
the Blood Maiden

2175
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
and you can do this

2176
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
you know

2177
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
by yourself

2178
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
or you can partner up

2179
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,000
with some buddies

2180
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
and all

2181
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I guess

2182
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
contribute to the

2183
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,000
summoning together

2184
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
and you know

2185
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
the Blood Maiden

2186
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
itself is our new

2187
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Helltide mini boss

2188
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
that she's immensely powerful

2189
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
but also very very lucrative

2190
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
and I think the last thing

2191
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I forgot to mention

2192
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
is that this is all

2193
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
expanding into

2194
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
World Tiers 1 and 2 as well

2195
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
and kind of like a

2196
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
distilled not diluted

2197
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
so there are

2198
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
the Helltide and World Tiers 1 and 2

2199
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
is more specifically tuned

2200
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
to you know

2201
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I guess like meet the leveling needs

2202
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
or the needs of the leveling player

2203
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
awesome

2204
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
on the Blood Maiden

2205
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I remember you had talked about

2206
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
with me before

2207
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
that

2208
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
the people that summon the Blood Maiden

2209
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
actually get bonus

2210
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
loot drops right?

2211
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
yeah absolutely

2212
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
so you can either contribute

2213
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
just by yourself

2214
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
to the Blood Maiden

2215
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and get some extra loot

2216
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
for you know

2217
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:45,000
your troubles

2218
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
we want to you know

2219
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
make sure that we give you

2220
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:47,000
a little bit extra

2221
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
because you're sacrificing

2222
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
up your hearts

2223
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
but also

2224
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
every player

2225
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,000
that

2226
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
it doesn't stack

2227
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
so you're not

2228
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,000
you know

2229
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
stressed to say

2230
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
hey I just need to be the one

2231
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
that summons them all

2232
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
we can all party up

2233
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
and just deposit our own

2234
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Baneful Hearts

2235
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and I guess reap the benefits of that

2236
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
yeah

2237
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:05,000
right

2238
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
to be clear

2239
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
so like

2240
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
so if you put in all three

2241
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
you get bonus loot right?

2242
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,000
correct

2243
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
but like you, me, and Colin

2244
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
are in a group

2245
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
and like I put in two

2246
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
and you put in one

2247
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
do I get more loot than you?

2248
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,000
no

2249
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,000
no

2250
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
so you get the same amount of loot

2251
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,000
so you know

2252
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
if Colin has a Baneful Heart

2253
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:21,000
to deposit

2254
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and if we all

2255
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
you know dump them in together

2256
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
then we all get the

2257
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
shared benefits of that

2258
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
but I will touch on a bit later

2259
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
the PTR updates

2260
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
and just some of the

2261
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
enhanced value

2262
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
that the Blood Maiden

2263
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
received since PTR

2264
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
for both contributors

2265
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
and non-contributors

2266
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
to the summon

2267
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,000
awesome

2268
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
yeah

2269
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
so a lot of new stuff

2270
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
coming in for Helltide

2271
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
and this is all part of the stuff

2272
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
that players got to experience

2273
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
in the PTR

2274
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
and of course we got learnings

2275
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,000
from the PTR

2276
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
as you just mentioned

2277
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
many

2278
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
do you want to

2279
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
walk us through

2280
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
some of the changes

2281
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
that are coming in

2282
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,000
with Helltide

2283
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
for all the

2284
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
the PTR feedback

2285
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
that we had

2286
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,000
yeah

2287
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I think I have a PowerPoint

2288
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:54,000
on my own

2289
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
there you go

2290
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,000
look at that

2291
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
yeah so

2292
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
you know as mentioned

2293
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
tons of sweeping changes

2294
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
going into the Helltides

2295
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
and just overall balance

2296
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
of the game in general

2297
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
season 4

2298
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and kind of with that

2299
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:07,000
sometimes you know

2300
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
we push a little bit too far

2301
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
in some regards

2302
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,000
so we did get feedback

2303
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
and also just own

2304
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
internal kind of

2305
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
field checks

2306
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
on the

2307
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Cinder drop rates

2308
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
were feeling a bit slow

2309
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
in the PTR

2310
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
so we just went back

2311
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:19,000
reviewed it

2312
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
and gathered our feedback

2313
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
and just iterated

2314
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,000
on the drop percentage

2315
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
to hit closer

2316
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
to the expectations

2317
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
of how much

2318
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
we want to be

2319
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
collecting the Helltides

2320
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
the Cinders

2321
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
and interacting

2322
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
with the tortured gifts

2323
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
so I think we're

2324
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
in a much better spot

2325
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I know we're in a much

2326
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
better spot right now

2327
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:36,000
actually

2328
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
so that was one

2329
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
of the first

2330
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
major pieces

2331
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
coming out

2332
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
from the PTR

2333
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
a lot more chess

2334
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,000
from this yeah

2335
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
yeah chess

2336
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
more loot

2337
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,000
more fun

2338
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
awesome

2339
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
let's see the next one

2340
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
yeah so

2341
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
on the topic of

2342
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
more is more fun

2343
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
the Baneful Hearts

2344
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:51,000
we were noticing

2345
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
that they were

2346
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
dropping a bit

2347
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
inconsistently

2348
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
so you can get

2349
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,000
the Baneful Hearts

2350
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
from opening

2351
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
tortured gifts

2352
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
killing the Hellborn

2353
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and one of the

2354
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Doomsayer variants

2355
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,000
one of our new

2356
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
activity types

2357
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
but again

2358
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
we want to get

2359
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
the Baneful Hearts

2360
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
in the hands

2361
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,000
of the players

2362
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
with a pretty

2363
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
steady cadence

2364
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
so we noticed

2365
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
with the PTR

2366
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,000
that we're just

2367
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
not gaining them

2368
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,000
as frequently

2369
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
as we wanted to

2370
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
so we just

2371
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,000
went back

2372
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
iterated and

2373
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
kind of reviewed

2374
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:19,000
our bad luck

2375
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
protection

2376
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
to just ensure

2377
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,000
that we

2378
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
improve the

2379
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
consistency

2380
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
that Baneful Hearts

2381
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
are dropping

2382
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,000
and this is all

2383
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
kind of like

2384
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
the Blood Maiden

2385
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,000
is not meant

2386
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
to be seen

2387
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,000
as like this

2388
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
highly ambitious

2389
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
piece of content

2390
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
that you only

2391
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,000
engage with

2392
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
like once

2393
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,000
every 50 levels

2394
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
we want you

2395
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
getting the hearts

2396
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
we want you

2397
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,000
engaging with

2398
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
the social boss

2399
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
summoning

2400
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
mechanic

2401
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
and you know

2402
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I think it just

2403
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:41,000
adds that extra

2404
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
layer to the

2405
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Helltides

2406
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
we want you

2407
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:43,000
to engage with

2408
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
and on the

2409
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,000
topic of

2410
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
the Blood Maiden

2411
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
overall

2412
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,000
like we

2413
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,000
touched on

2414
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
earlier

2415
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
the Blood Maiden

2416
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:51,000
is just

2417
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
saving some

2418
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,000
overall

2419
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
rewards

2420
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,000
improvements

2421
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
so as

2422
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,000
noticed

2423
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,000
or as

2424
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
mentioned

2425
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,000
before

2426
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
if you

2427
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
contribute

2428
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,000
to the

2429
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
summon

2430
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
of the

2431
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Blood Maiden

2432
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
you receive

2433
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,000
a bonus

2434
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
reward

2435
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,000
but one

2436
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,000
of the

2437
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
things

2438
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,000
was that

2439
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
you couldn't

2440
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
really tell

2441
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,000
there is a

2442
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
little icon

2443
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,000
that appears

2444
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
like when

2445
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:07,000
you're buff

2446
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:07,000
bar

2447
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
but the

2448
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
effects of

2449
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,000
that was

2450
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
largely

2451
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,000
unnoticed

2452
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
from both

2453
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:11,000
the team

2454
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:11,000
and actually

2455
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
just the

2456
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,000
PTR

2457
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
players

2458
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:13,000
themselves

2459
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
so again

2460
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
taking this

2461
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,000
opportunity

2462
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
to just

2463
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
review the

2464
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,000
overall

2465
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
value

2466
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,000
of the

2467
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Blood Maiden

2468
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:19,000
for

2469
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
contributors

2470
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
and non-contributors

2471
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,000
alike

2472
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
because again

2473
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
we wanted

2474
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
to make sure

2475
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,000
that she

2476
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
has a

2477
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
clear role

2478
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
in the

2479
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Helltide

2480
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
experience

2481
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
so again

2482
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
overall

2483
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Blood Maiden

2484
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,000
is just

2485
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,000
overall

2486
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
more valuable

2487
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
with this

2488
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
we're dropping

2489
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,000

at the

2500
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:39,000
end

2501
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
world

2502
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,000
tiers

2503
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000

2509
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
yeah

2510
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,000
so this

2511
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,000
is now

2512
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
like an

2513
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
additional

2514
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,000
opportunity

2515
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
for players

2516
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,000
to get

2517
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,000
additional

2518
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
of the

01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,000
boss

2520
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
mats

2521
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,000
for the

2522
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,000
boss

2523
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
ladders

2524
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,000
yeah

2525
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
which you

2526
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,000
know

2527
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
we've heard

2528
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,000
a lot

2529
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
about

2530
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,000
how

2531
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,000
players

2532
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
were like

2533
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,000
hey

2534
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,000
we only

2535
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
really have

2536
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,000
one

2537
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
kind of

2538
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,000
method

2539
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,000
to get

2540
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
them

2541
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,000
and we

2542
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
wanted to

2543
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,000
expand

2544
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,000
that

2545
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
and bring

2546
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,000
that

2547
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,000
into

2548
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
more

2549
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
avenues

2550
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
so players

2551
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,000
didn't have

2552
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,000
to just

2553
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
kind of

2554
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,000
be like

2555
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
tunneled

2556
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,000
off

2557
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,000
into one

2558
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
area

2559
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,000
to get

2560
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
specific

2561
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,000
boss

2562
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,000
mats

2563
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
which

2564
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,000
is cool

2565
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,000
yeah

2566
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
variety of

2567
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,000
the spice

2568
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
of life

2569
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,000
yes

2570
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,000
i like

2571
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
that the

2572
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,000
contribution

2573
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
encourages you

2574
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
to actually

2575
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,000
use these

2576
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
in season 2

2577
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
i just

2578
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,000
chain summon

2579
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
the boss

2580
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,000
over and

2581
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,000
over and

2582
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
over and

2583
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,000
there would

2584
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,000
be this

2585
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
awkward dance

2586
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:16,000
where someone

2587
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
would show

2588
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:17,000
up and it's

2589
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
like i know

2590
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,000
you have

2591
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
yeah

2592
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
use your

2593
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
material

2594
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
yeah that's

2595
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,000
why it's

2596
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
really also

2597
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,000
important that

2598
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
the nuance

2599
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
is not

2600
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,000
nuance is

2601
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
honestly lost

2602
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
pretty frequently

2603
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,000
when we're

2604
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
talking about

2605
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,000
drops for

2606
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
different kinds

2607
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,000
of creatures

2608
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and different

2609
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,000
sorts of

2610
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,000
situations

2611
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
like this

2612
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,000
like treasure

2613
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
goblin

2614
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,000
we talked

2615
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,000
about treasure

2616
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
goblin a

2617
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,000
while ago

2618
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,000
a few seasons

2619
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
ago

2620
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
and i

2621
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,000
remember i

2622
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,000
put a poll

2623
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
out on

2624
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
x.com

2625
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
so i put a

2626
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,000
poll out

2627
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
basically asking

2628
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,000
players what

2629
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
they believed

2630
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,000
the legendary

2631
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
drop rate of

2632
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
treasure goblins

2633
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,000
to be and i

2634
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
had a whole

2635
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,000
bunch of

2636
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,000
options and

2637
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
every like i

2638
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,000
think like 85%

2639
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
of the players

2640
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,000
were wrong

2641
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
and because the

2642
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
drop rate at

2643
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,000
that time was

2644
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
50% players

2645
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,000
didn't feel it

2646
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
because they

2647
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,000
didn't see the

2648
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,000
treasure goblin

2649
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
enough to

2650
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,000
really notice

2651
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
that it was

2652
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
actually that

2653
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
high so uh

2654
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,000
so i think

2655
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
making sure that

2656
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:02,000
like we were

2657
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
like buffing up

2658
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:03,000
those moments

2659
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
where like if i

2660
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,000
have my

2661
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
contribution bonus

2662
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:05,000
a little bit

2663
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
higher that

2664
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,000
helps make

2665
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,000
sure that

2666
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
is felt

2667
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
yeah absolutely

2668
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
you know what's

2669
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:09,000
funny is uh

2670
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
joe talking

2671
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
off screen

2672
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and we're all

2673
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
looking off

2674
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,000
and people are

2675
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
just staring

2676
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:13,000
us stare

2677
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
into this

2678
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
random corner

2679
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and stuff

2680
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
you know what

2681
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:16,000
would be funny

2682
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
is we all

2683
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,000
just actually

2684
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
looked back

2685
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,000
there at

2686
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
bail

2687
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,000
we should

2688
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
plan that

2689
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,000
every time

2690
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
yeah every

2691
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,000
time and

2692
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
like joe's

2693
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,000
turned into

2694
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,000
bail

2695
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
oh oh

2696
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,000
so literally

2697
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
coming out

2698
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,000
oh

2699
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
that's

2700
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
awkward

2701
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
that wasn't

2702
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
part of

2703
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,000
the plan

2704
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,000
i like the

2705
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
deep shadows

2706
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,000
that's right

2707
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
he is

2708
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
i guess the

2709
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
moments when

2710
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,000
i decide to

2711
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
say something

2712
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,000
maybe the

2713
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,000
location

2714
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:35,000
like oh

2715
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
we have

2716
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,000
another

2717
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:36,000
camera

2718
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
awesome

2719
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,000
um

2720
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
cool

2721
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
so a lot

2722
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
of a lot

2723
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,000
of health

2724
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,000
high changes

2725
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
that we

2726
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,000
have uh

2727
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
coming in

2728
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
yeah i think

2729
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,000
there's actually

2730
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
one more slide

2731
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,000
yeah one more

2732
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
um so

2733
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
one thing that

2734
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
we've kind of

2735
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
covered a lot

2736
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
across like just

2737
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
tempering and

2738
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
just the masterwork

2739
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,000
and just the

2740
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
spirit of season

2741
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,000
four in general

2742
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:52,000
just like

2743
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
removing friction

2744
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:54,000
points and

2745
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
just keeping

2746
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
players in the

2747
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:56,000
flow of

2748
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:56,000
you know

2749
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
the flow of

2750
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:57,000
fun

2751
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
people want to

2752
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,000
blast

2753
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
yeah absolutely

2754
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
so one of

2755
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
the doomsayer

2756
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,000
variants

2757
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,000
and again like

2758
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
the doomsayer's

2759
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
new activity type

2760
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,000
it's kind of

2761
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,000
like a kinder

2762
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
surprise where you

2763
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
interact with them

2764
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,000
they crackle and

2765
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
pop into something

2766
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
a variety of

2767
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
things actually

2768
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
so one of the

2769
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:09,000
variants that we

2770
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
had was the

2771
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
chest of doomsaying

2772
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
where they would

2773
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
explode into a

2774
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
tortured gift that

2775
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
costs 50 cinders

2776
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
and gives you a

2777
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
whole lot of good

2778
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
stuff we're kind

2779
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,000
of reviewing that

2780
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
and sometimes

2781
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
what could happen

2782
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,000
is you can

2783
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
encounter one of

2784
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,000
these at the

2785
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
very start of

2786
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
your helltide

2787
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,000
running you

2788
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
don't have 50

2789
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
cinders it's not

2790
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,000
a lot to get

2791
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
but it still is

2792
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,000
kind of a

2793
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
stressful

2794
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
potentially feels

2795
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
bad moment

2796
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
so we just

2797
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,000
said hey let's

2798
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
just have it

2799
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
explode into the

2800
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,000
loot directly

2801
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
you save 50

2802
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
cinders and you

2803
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,000
kind of just keep

2804
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
going on your

2805
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
merry way in the

2806
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
tides so that's

2807
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,000
one of the kind

2808
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
of like efficiency

2809
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
smoothing outs that

2810
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
we've done the

2811
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,000
next one is also

2812
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
just we're dumping

2813
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
a whole bunch of

2814
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
monsters on you and

2815
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
it's always a feel

2816
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:48,000
bad moment you get

2817
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
knocked out of the

2818
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
interaction you're

2819
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:50,000
trying just to open

2820
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
up the tortured gift

2821
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
and you know head

2822
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
out so we reduce

2823
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
the channel time to

2824
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
open tortured gifts

2825
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
from three seconds to

2826
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
1.5 seconds I

2827
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
believe for season

2828
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
four launch proper

2829
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
nice that'll help

2830
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
a lot so and I

2831
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:03,000
think while I

2832
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
just some feedback

2833
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
like you know why

2834
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
don't we just make

2835
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
it instant right

2836
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
right right yeah

2837
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
you know we kind

2838
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
of do want to

2839
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
safeguard against like

2840
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
the accidental clicks

2841
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
again it's a frenetic

2842
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
game so you're

2843
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
clicking a whole

2844
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
bunch and you know

2845
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I think 1.5 seconds

2846
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
is enough time to

2847
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
you know let you

2848
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
make sure that

2849
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,000
that's what you

2850
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
want to commit to

2851
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
before you open it

2852
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
and there's also

2853
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
like because you

2854
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
guys can talk about

2855
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
this there there's

2856
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,000
changes to like the

2857
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
channeling like you

2858
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
you I think with

2859
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
like dot damage and

2860
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
stuff like that

2861
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
but yeah dot damage

2862
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,000
that will interrupt

2863
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
channeling as well

2864
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
which is a pretty

2865
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
nice which is good

2866
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
so especially as

2867
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
you are in the

2868
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
frantic areas of

2869
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
helltide and

2870
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
everything so yeah

2871
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
lots of helltide

2872
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,000
changes a lot of

2873
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
good feedback from

2874
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
players from PTR

2875
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Derek thanks for

2876
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,000
walking through on

2877
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
that but you're not

2878
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000

01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
loot reborn and

2884
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
part of helltide

2885
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
includes the iron

2886
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
wolves and some

2887
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,000
people have figured

2888
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
that out even before

2889
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
our blog on Tuesday

2890
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
but we did want to

2891
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
talk a little bit

2892
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
about season four

2893
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
and the iron wolves

2894
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
participation in that

2895
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
along with some

2896
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
cool things that are

2897
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
specific to seasonal

2898
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
characters for season

2899
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
four as well yeah

2900
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
yeah so again as

2901
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
mentioned the players

2902
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
who joined us in the

2903
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
PTR or again caught

2904
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
all the various blog

2905
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
posts will notice that

2906
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
the iron wolves are

2907
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
now a permanent part

2908
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
of the helltides you

2909
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
know they're fighting

2910
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
and dying alongside the

2911
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,000
players now and

2912
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
they're here to stay

2913
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
however for our

2914
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
seasonal players we

2915
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:31,000
have the call the

2916
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
wolves seasonal

2917
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
activity where players

2918
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
will get to spend a bit

2919
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
more time with the

2920
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
iron wolves and go on

2921
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
a bit of a journey with

2922
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
them to try and uncover

2923
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
the potential root cause

2924
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
behind these rising

2925
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
tides and uncover this

2926
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
mysterious phenomenon

2927
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
that's threatening to

2928
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
corrupt and consume the

2929
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
iron wolves from within

2930
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
in addition to that you

2931
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
know again the iron wolves

2932
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
are in the helltides with

2933
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
you as players are

2934
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
fighting and dying

2935
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
alongside the iron wolves

2936
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
and the helltides you're

2937
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
also gonna be earning

2938
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
your way through the

2939
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
wolves honor reputation

2940
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
system and this is

2941
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
saying you progress your

2942
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
way through a collection

2943
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
of just super juiced

2944
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
rewards that are

2945
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
specifically tuned to

2946
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
overpower your leveling

2947
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
journey from level one

2948
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
to 100 and beyond

2949
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
the main pillar for this

2950
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
reputation track was

2951
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
really pushing the

2952
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
players powers forward

2953
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
the player power forward

2954
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
there you go the

2955
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
players power forward

2956
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
and giving them early

2957
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
access to you know gear

2958
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
with the juice stats

2959
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
legendaries materials

2960
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
boss materials and even

2961
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
a resplendent spark to

2962
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
as like a cherry on top

2963
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
at the end we love the

2964
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
juice we do you do love

2965
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
that but you know in the

2966
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
spirit of weight there's

2967
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
more you know those are

2968
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,000
all like the gameplay

2969
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
related things but we

2970
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
also have a couple really

2971
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
cool cosmetics that you

2972
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000

we wanted to talk about

2999
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
with uh this season

3000
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
specific because it is

3001
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
specific for um season

3002
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000

3004
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,000
reminder of that there's

3005
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
so much to cover

3006
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
i know derek has like

3007
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
the the largest list of

3008
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,000
items to kind of go

3009
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
through here so um yeah

3010
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
so you know as mentioned

3011
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
before on the seasonal

3012
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
team we love our

3013
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
experiments and i don't

3014
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
think a season would be

3015
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
one without some level

3016
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
of experiments so with

3017
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:48,000
that we have the seasonal

3018
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
item or as kind of like

3019
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
call it the seasonal toy

3020
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
and that's the profane

3021
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
mind cage um yeah so

3022
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
there it is so the

3023
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
profane mind cage is

3024
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,000
pretty cool in the sense

3025
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
that it's a guaranteed

3026
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
drop from the hellborn and

3027
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
when you consume it i kind

3028
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
of like to imagine you

3029
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
just like eating this

3030
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
demon brain um yeah

3031
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
when you can when you

3032
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
consume it uh for the

3033
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
next 60 minutes the

3034
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
hell type monsters are

3035
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
going to be boosted up

3036
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
to 10 levels depending on

3037
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:13,000
the world tier that you

3038
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
consumed it in and

3039
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
you're also going to be

3040
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
increasing their aberrant

3041
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
cinder drop rates so

3042
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
you know again all

3043
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
tying this back to that

3044
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
leveling journey and like

3045
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
tempering and stuff like

3046
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
this is a really fun

3047
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
item that lets you kind

3048
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
of put your build to a

3049
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:29,000
little bit more of a

3050
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
test in exchange for

3051
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
maximizing your hell

3052
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
tight efficiencies

3053
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
through you know just

3054
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
one higher monster level

3055
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
means you know more xp

3056
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
and stuff like that and

3057
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:38,000
also just aberrant cinder

3058
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
drops too you know

3059
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
oh go ahead okay i was

3060
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
gonna say we reduced the

3061
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
world tier to three and

3062
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
four xp so that's great

3063
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
yeah it ties super well

3064
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,000
you can just get to

3065
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
blast the endgame very

3066
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
quickly now yep yeah and

3067
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
with the mine page itself

3068
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
like uh you know because

3069
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
everyone's probably going

3070
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
like well that's a

3071
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
consumable like how how do

3072
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
how do people end up like

3073
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
obtaining additional ones

3074
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
of those or can you get

3075
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
more of those throughout

3076
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
the season and everything

3077
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
yeah we want to be very

3078
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
uh generous with those um

3079
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
so one they're guaranteed

3080
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
drop from the hellborn

3081
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
in world tiers three and

3082
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
four but you can also use

3083
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
them in world tiers one and

3084
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
two so if you want to like

3085
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
boost some level you know

3086
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
alts and whatnot um you

3087
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
also get a uh i think like

3088
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
a bucket of them through

3089
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
the wolves honor reputation

3090
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
like we crammed as many

3091
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
rewards as we could in

3092
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
there so they will be in

3093
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
steady stream so don't

3094
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
again in the spirit of like

3095
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
use it don't hoard it

3096
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
definitely experiment and

3097
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:31,000
have fun with this thing

3098
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
because you know it's it's

3099
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
a game have fun yeah so

3100
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
it's great like if you want

3101
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:35,000
a little bit more of a

3102
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
challenge a little bit better

3103
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
rewards as well you can of

3104
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
course use your your mind

3105
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
cage uh and that is

3106
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
exclusive for um uh

3107
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
players in the season so

3108
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
yeah it's awesome to see

3109
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
um but yeah thank you

3110
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
derek for walking us

3111

through all the changes

3112
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,000
with helltide and of

3113
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
course some of the the

3114
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
new season stuff with the

3115
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
iron wolves and if you're

3116
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
a lore nerd uh iron wolves

3117
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
of course are very familiar

3118
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
faction within diablo they

3119
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
are from diablo 2 act 3

3120
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
you could actually hire

3121
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
them as uh some of your

3122
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
your mercenaries they are

3123
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
one of the mercenary

3124
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
options though we know a

3125
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
lot of people went with an

3126
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
act 2 mercenary in diablo 2

3127
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
for the aura but yes um

3128
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
cool thank you so much uh

3129
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
derek and of course we uh

3130
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
still have more to talk

3131
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
about we're actually going

3132
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
to go back to colin uh and

3133
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
colin is going to talk us

3134
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
through a little bit about

3135
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
the pit um the pit is a

3136
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
brand new feature within

3137
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
season four and is now a

3138
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
permanent feature within

3139
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
diablo 4 um and uh yeah

3140
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
do you want to like give

3141
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
us a breakdown for people who

3142
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
may have not experienced the

3143
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
pit or may have not seen the

3144
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
stream beforehand and then on

3145
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
top of that uh tell us about

3146
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
all the improvements that

3147
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
we're doing to the pit based

3148
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
off of feedback yeah so you

3149
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
know something that players

3150
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
have asked for uh since we

3151
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
did a bunch of nerfs to the

3152
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
nightmare dungeons uh if

3153
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
you recall i forget what

3154
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
season it was but we made a

3155
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
tier 100 nightmare dungeons a

3156
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
lot easier so players can get

3157
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
through them um one of the

3158
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
big pieces of feedback we got

3159
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
was okay well where's my

3160
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
measuring stick you know the

3161
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
game is a power fantasy it's

3162
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
about getting as much raw power

3163
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
as possible and just

3164
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
dominating right so if there's

3165
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
no place to push back then

3166
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
you know everything is just a

3167
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
little bit too easy so the pit of

3168
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
the artificer is our answer to

3169
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
that measuring stick you're

3170
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
going to be able to push very

3171
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
deep into the pit um there's a

3172
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
lot of levels we were inspired

3173
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
by abattoir of zir but to be

3174
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
very clear you know abattoir of

3175
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
zero was a special case in that

3176
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
each tier jump was just like

3177
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
brutal it was like exponential

3178
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
it was like ridiculously hard

3179
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
every single tier and it's like

3180
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
ah you could only get to seven

3181
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
uh which isn't very heroic or

3182
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
or powerful right so we've taken a

3183
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
lot of the learnings from abattoir

3184
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
of zero um the pit goes uh very

3185
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
deep there's many more tears it's

3186
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
much more gradual so you can start

3187
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
pushing into it um and getting some

3188
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
of these master working material

3189
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
rewards um and the pit is all about

3190
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
you know just blasting through

3191
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
monsters and the demons of hell right

3192
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
there's no negative modifiers we're

3193
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
not cc'ing you a bunch you know this

3194
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
is really just a test of how powerful

3195
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
your build is um so from the ptr we

3196
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
actually got feedback that it was way

3197
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
too easy um because we added a ton of

3198
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
a ton of power through tempering um

3199
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
through the codex of power it's just

3200
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
much easier to get a lot of that those

3201
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
aspects online um so we've taken a

3202
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
look and we've moved some of the

3203
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
master working material tiers around

3204
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
previously uh you know the tier one

3205
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
master working materials only came from

3206
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
one to twenty we've moved that up uh

3207
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
ten tiers so tier one will come from

3208
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
one to twenty nine tier two will come

3209
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
from thirty to fifty nine and tier three

3210
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
will be sixty plus and what that does it

3211
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
it just makes the journey feel a little

3212
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
bit more rewarding right like we saw in

3213
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
the ptr that people just like within

3214
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
the first two hours just blasted through

3215
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
all of it because they're so powerful

3216
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
um so we've just adjusted some of the

3217
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
the rates there so you have to push a

3218
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
little bit deeper you have to optimize

3219
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
your build a little bit more so those

3220
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
armor caps are things to watch out for

3221
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
right where if you're over the armor

3222
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
cap it's just a straight optimization to

3223
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
start thinking about how you want to

3224
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
replace some of that armor we think that

3225
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
feels pretty good and overall we've

3226
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
increased the health and damage or

3227
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
sorry i should say increase the health on

3228
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
all monsters post level 100 both in the

3229
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
pit and nightmare dungeons so the enemy

3230
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
should be pushing back on you a little

3231
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
bit more right you care a little bit

3232
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
more about utility defense outside of just

3233
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
one-shotting everything right so it sort of

3234
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
tests you a lot more you know and part of

3235
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
that feedback though that we've heard is

3236
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
that well like nightmare dungeons don't

3237
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
feel very rewarding and the pit doesn't

3238
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
feel super rewarding post you know that

3239
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
that sixty tier when you're getting those

3240
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
master working top-end master working

3241
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
materials so we've done two major changes

3242
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
one is we've added obols that scale with

3243
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
both of these tears so everything past

3244
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
tier 46 and nightmare dungeons and

3245
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
everything past tier one in the pit

3246
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
actually it just always gives you obols you

3247
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
might ask like but obols are terrible but

3248
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
you know again why do i want obols call it i

3249
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
know right a big part of season four was

3250
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
that you know we made the gambler guarantee

3251
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
of the p9 25 legendaries at level 100 and

3252
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
those legendaries can roll greater

3253
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
affixes so you know if you blow you know a

3254
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
ton of obols on two-handers for example

3255
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
those two-handed legendaries are getting

3256
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
are the same as anywhere else in the game so

3257
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
it's actually a huge efficiency boost to

3258
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
getting the items you're looking for

3259
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
so to be clear you can get like some of the

3260
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
best items in the game from the obol

3261
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
vendor now absolutely and and one thing that

3262
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
is also changing with obols it's like

3263
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
because you know when people pick up obols

3264
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
they're like oh i've got my cap and yeah

3265
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
someone's like typing but calling the

3266
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
oval cap is fine so you know like we've

3267
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
increased the oval cap substantially so

3268
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
the amount of obols you get now is 2500

3269
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
you can hold up so you can just like go to

3270
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
the gambler and be like give me everything

3271
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
and you can just do that a couple of times

3272
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
so get your obols and hit the tables

3273
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
yeah yeah exactly and the items are

3274
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
incredible and just and just to like double

3275
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
down this for a second too like the like

3276
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
one of the things that we also did as part

3277
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
of this like when you're when you use the

3278
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
enchanting feature in diablo 4 you can't

3279
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
actually enchant off of an affix into a

3280
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
greater affix that's right yeah so when a

3281
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
good item drops for you in the in the

3282
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
base game you can't you can't try to like

3283
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
roll for greater affixes off the

3284
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
enchanting system it's good for getting you

3285
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
to a stat you really need in a situation

3286
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
where an item didn't get you what you

3287
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
wanted but now with the obols vendor like

3288
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
those items not only are they ipower 925

3289
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
and they have the chance to be legendary of

3290
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
course like they are like the obols vendor

3291
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
always has but you also have a chance to

3292
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
get greater affixes off those gambled items

3293
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
yeah so if you are again if you're

3294
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
looking for a particular pair of gloves

3295
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
you're looking for a particular helmet

3296
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
and you're really you're saying i really

3297
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
want a greater affix version of cooldown

3298
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
reduction on my helmet right like now

3299
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
it's okay cool i'm going to take my

3300
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
2000 obols i'm going to go to the i'm

3301
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
going to go to the vendor i'm just going

3302
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
to just gamble gamble gamble gamble and

3303
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
try to get the try to get that one

3304
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
helmet yeah like now i have a chance to

3305
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
really do that and this is a way for

3306
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
you to like getting more drops and and

3307
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
and such inside the pit is one thing

3308
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
but giving you more choice when you get

3309
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
out of a pit run i think very very

3310
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
valuable it's going to feel way better

3311
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
yeah absolutely yeah and another change

3312
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
we made uh was to glyph xp we got a bunch

3313
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
of feedback that's like god what the hell

3314
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
nightmare dungeon so we've increased the

3315
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
glyph xp by 25 percent which is faster

3316
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
leveling we've also scaled the amount of

3317
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
rune shards which is the pit currency to

3318
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
get into the pit with nightmare dungeon

3319
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
so you can create sort of a positive

3320
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
feedback loop if you're really strong

3321
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
you're really powerful you're hitting

3322
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
those tier 100s and the nightmare dungeons

3323
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
you're getting tons of pit keys that you

3324
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
can then translate into the pit and just

3325
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
get lots of runs and lots of master

3326
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
working there yeah so right a lot of

3327
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
feedback from nightmare dungeons people

3328
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
were saying like hey um are we planning on

3329
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
making any changes to that glyph xp and

3330
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
you know so there there are some we sure

3331
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
did we we actioned on it for sure so uh and

3332
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
there's funny enough there's also even in

3333
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
the um uh the season journey i believe

3334
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
there's also like a changes to that the

3335
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
the ashes themselves where you can actually

3336
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
use that to boost even like yeah like

3337
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
glyph xp is also part of that um with the

3338
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
the season journey so very cool um stuff

3339
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
that we have one more sorry i have this

3340
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
list but then i don't actually read it but

3341
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
then she's like a prop yeah sorry um the one

3342
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
other thing that we did was we heard a

3343
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
bunch of feedback that uh players were

3344
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
dying at the end of the pit because we

3345
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
have this like shadow boss that sometimes

3346
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
comes in and throws a wrench in what you're

3347
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
doing um and you know as much as i push for

3348
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
learn to play you know our encounter

3349
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
designer

3350
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
absolutely uh take that hardcore players

3351
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
surprise yeah yeah isn't it fun to die

3352
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
after you killed the boss uh yeah so uh our

3353
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
encounter designer uh did an amazing job

3354
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
cleaning up a lot of those affixes after

3355
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
you killed that boss and the arena should

3356
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
be clear now as chat says get good um but

3357
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
uh yeah we we we saw that a lot and you

3358
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
know if you're a hardcore player that would

3359
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
have been a tragic loss to your character

3360
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
i prefer the word hilarious

3361
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
some designers like fist pumping like yes

3362
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
yeah just watching streams and reactions

3363
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
from that so awesome so a lot of changes

3364
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
coming for the pit pit is of course a new

3365
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
feature within diablo 4 permanently and

3366
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
you can experience that in eternal and

3367
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
seasonal realms um and of course we have

3368
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
some updates to the boss ladder because the

3369
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
boss ladder itself is changing pretty

3370
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
pretty significantly we talked a little bit

3371
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
about like how you can get additional

3372
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
materials in other places um that derek had

3373
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,000
mentioned uh but uh colin has additional um

3374
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
like points that he wants to bring up about

3375
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
the boss ladder because we got a lot of

3376
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
feedback on that and uh there's some new

3377
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
changes to it with season four

3378
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
yeah so we added and dariel the best lesser

3379
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
evil yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

3380
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
yeah yeah he's dunking me yeah yeah he's

3381
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
dunking me with orbs all day who likes that

3382
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
yeah so uh and dariel obviously has come

3383
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
back she's incredibly fun to fight the

3384
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
encounter design team killed it um and you

3385
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
know on top of endorial we've added a new

3386
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
tier to the boss ladder uh called tormented

3387
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
bosses so these are much higher level than

3388
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
level 200 bosses um sort of pinnacle aspirational

3389
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
bosses to take down and what we've done here is

3390
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
we heard a bunch of feedback that it required

3391
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
five times the amount of boss materials

3392
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
including some rare pit material to summon

3393
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
these and five times the reward um that

3394
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
didn't really feel like the right amount of

3395
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
reward efficiency for taking on something

3396
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
that was challenging so we've nerfed the cost

3397
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
it's now 3x the amount of boss material and

3398
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
5x the reward so you get some pretty big

3399
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
efficiency wins there especially if you're

3400
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
crushing them in the end game um so that's

3401
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
feeling pretty good uh we think we also heard a

3402
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
lot of feedback that it's uh tedious to do the

3403
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
same activity over and over and over to

3404
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
summon some of these things right so it's

3405
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
like i want to summon penitent knight or i

3406
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
want to do the beast and ice i know you and

3407
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
i've done that one like yeah every bill i've

3408
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
chosen in a season requires the beast and

3409
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
ice and it's like i guess i'm doing another

3410
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
nightmare dungeon yeah yeah yeah so um yeah

3411
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
well we made it better um a lot of our

3412
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
random uh you know monsters and activities

3413
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
and and things like that so you know elites

3414
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
whisper caches treasure goblins world

3415
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
bosses you know hellborn to name a few

3416
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
are all going to start randomly dropping

3417
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
um these boss materials so you know you're

3418
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
not necessarily forced into doing one exact

3419
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
activity it's still going to be the

3420
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
absolute best way to get some of this

3421
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
boss material but as long as you're

3422
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
blasting you're just going to be getting a

3423
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
lot of these materials ambiently which you

3424
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
can trade you can just sort of cash in on

3425
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
on your heart's desire and we think this

3426
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
makes the game feel more flexible and just

3427
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
sort of enables you to play a little bit more

3428
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
on how you want to play while still keeping

3429
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
the experience fresh um so we think that's

3430
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
going to be a pretty big win yeah it's

3431
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
huge yeah um to jump back into the torment

3432
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
bosses uh just because i'm going to jump

3433
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
around a little bit uh we heard a bunch of

3434
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
feedback uh especially from wadijo uh

3435
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
hopefully he's watching uh is is there's no

3436
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
way we just watching right now probably not

3437
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
yeah it's not very it's not very interesting um

3438
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
we we did some tuning uh to make sure that

3439
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
the tormented versions have some more parody

3440
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
right it was sort of like a in a scenario where like one of the

3441
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
latter bosses was just like dead easy didn't

3442
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,000
really match the difficulty of the rest and that's important because we give

3443
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
you one guaranteed resplendent spark one

3444
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
time for defeating any of these so one step closer to getting that uber

3445
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
unique that's not just a raw drop of your choice

3446
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
which is pretty awesome and then something else you know speaking of

3447
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
resplendent sparks we're adding one to uber lilith so the first time you kill

3448
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,000
uber lilith you're also going to get another resplendent spark so now that that

3449
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,000
brings us to three opportunities of being able to earn yourself a resplendent spark we heard one

3450
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:24,000
from from derek at the end of the the season and the iron wolves you know uh uh board and

3451
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,000
and doing that within the season we now have one with uh the echo of lilith and of course one

3452
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
with your first tormented boss as well so uh additional opportunities to earn resplendent

3453
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
sparks and of course you can still salvage your uh any uh uber gear that you do happen to find

3454
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
yeah and you can actually earn a resplendent spark yeah so what that means is if you do all of these

3455
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
and then you get an uber unique you can actually change that into whatever one you want yes yeah

3456
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
is really what that means and then something else you know on on the uber uniques is that

3457
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:00,000
i'm just laughing because i i didn't realize this but chat's calling out with our our tool tip

3458
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,000
that we showed we had 200 plus resplendent sparks yeah that's what happens when we're just really

3459
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,000
lucky we're doing good yeah yeah that's how i get them let me tell you guys about dev tools

3460
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:22,000
yeah that's actually my account online oh yeah yeah nice um so uh on on the uber uniques um you know

3461
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
we heard a bunch of feedback that it feels like a chore to have to do you know the pendant at night

3462
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:33,000
into varshon into doing durial just for a chance at an uber unique right um and you know we've experienced

3463
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
that ourselves right it's like god i gotta do all this stuff to to fight the boss that's going to

3464
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,000
actually drop something that i care about um you know greater affix has helped that because you know

3465
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,000
that there's some variation to the uniques you're going to get but for uber uniques we've actually

3466
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,000
added a small chance um a little bit lower than durial to all of the ladder bosses and they're going

3467
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
to have a chance to drop an uber unique as well so you know while you're grinding through this ladder

3468
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
every single boss you kill is going to have a chance to drop an uber unique it's not exactly the same

3469
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:07,000
music uh dariel durial and and dariel we should do like a combo a lot of rails um and uh we think

3470
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
that's going to make it feel a lot better awesome so yeah a lot of changes coming with uh boss ladder

3471
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,000
and changes based off of ptr feedback that we saw yeah lots just overall changes for season four that

3472
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,000
we were we're planning so that it's um gives more opportunities for players to actually experience

3473
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:28,000
of course the uh the new versions of the bosses themselves and their tormented echo versions so

3474
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
awesome thank you so much colin of course um and i know we wanted to before we jump into q a because

3475
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
we we're getting towards the end of our updates for season four um mr adam jackson wants to talk a

3476
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
little bit about um the season journey this is actually something really cool one last thing um

3477
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
us over on class designer we're really passionate about this and we're excited for it so the season

3478
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
journey uh so we really want to kind of juice the rewards and make the season journey

3479
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
more exciting and so what we went and did was when you're going through the season journey for

3480
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:03,000
every class you're actually going to be getting a preset curated amount of legendaries as you're

3481
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
going through that are targeted toward a specific build so we chose a build for every class in season

3482
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
four and we're going to change it around in future seasons please give us feedback on this but

3483
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
we think it'll be pretty cool but you're basically going to get like close to a completed build when

3484
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:21,000
it comes to opening those caches they're guaranteed targeted legendaries to build a specific

3485
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
fantasy for every class i think we have a video to show what they're going to be for every class

3486
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:32,000
in season four maybe maybe there so barbarian here you can see uh we're going to be giving you a bunch

3487
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:38,000
of legendaries related to dust doubles uh the druid we're going to be giving you basically a pulverized

3488
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:48,000
build which is pretty cool next is the necromancer of course everybody's going to be playing minions so

3489
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:54,000
we give you a bunch of minion focused legendaries it should be pretty awesome and then next is the

3490
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,000
sorceress we actually have a cool new legendary coming into the game for incinerate which you'll

3491
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
see here it's what's up so we were giving you an incinerate build on the sorceress

3492
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:08,000
and then the rogue uh we're giving you one target toward barrage so again kind of the point of this

3493
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
is that you know if you don't really know what you want to play or you really want to just go through

3494
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
a season journey and try out something before you go to a build that you really want to do you have a

3495
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
foundation of something more complete to start with which we're pretty excited about yeah and with

3496
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
the codex change now uh you also get to collect all those those items are actually dropping out of the uh

3497
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
the season journey caches you get to kind of keep those they're all going to your codex you use that

3498
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:35,000
build the entire your leveling process correct yeah awesome so lots of changes coming season

3499
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,000
sorry my mic died halfway through there so i had to do a quick mic swap as we were playing also uh

3500
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,000
joe pipe or is back um yeah hi joe derek is now over here so uh if people are confused of like what's

3501
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
going on we are playing musical chairs today that is that is also a new feature our favorite season four

3502
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:58,000
i'm just kidding um but uh yeah so all a lot of changes season four pretty huge is by far the biggest

3503
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:05,000
season um for diablo 4 yet uh and i know we wanted to jump into q a i do want to bring up one thing

3504
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:12,000
as well oh wow which is this is a change that uh will be represented in by the way patch notes are

3505
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
coming out immediately after this stream so geez okay so that's one thing so yeah people can check

3506
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
out patch notes immediately after this stream you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed writing it

3507
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:27,000
we're writing it and reviewing it and editing it and i wouldn't based off of the size of the patch notes i

3508
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
wouldn't be surprised if we do have a few things that might be missing that we'll probably like

3509
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:37,000
have to post ad if if uh as we're kind of going through it just because it's massive in terms of

3510
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:43,000
size as people saw from ptr and now it's just even a few different teams like effort trying to lose

3511
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:49,000
too yeah so uh but uh patch notes will be up one thing in the patch notes that i did want to bring up is

3512
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:55,000
and this is a thing that's coming in season four is uh for players that want to change the their their hair

3513
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
on their characters themselves they can actually go to the wardrobe now and actually be able to do

3514
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
it which is a nice like good quality of life feature we've heard a lot of people go like hey

3515
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,000
i kind of want to you know i made that character a while ago especially like an internal character

3516
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
or something like that i would like to be able to change that around yeah i now have that flexibility

3517
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:16,000
being able to do so which is actually really cool so um we're going to jump into q a as usual as we

3518
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:22,000
always do um we will start off with a question this is actually something that's been a a popular topic

3519
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
that a lot of people have been talking about uh since ptr and of course even this week with the

3520
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:34,000
the blog itself but um don't leave me in suspense i know i i i uh that i think we have the question

3521
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:39,000
there it is uh what does this mean for season powers in the future oh just what season four is

3522
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:45,000
like the nature of season four yeah okay sure so yeah season four is a uh season four as i mentioned

3523
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
before is like an opportunity for us to kind of like lift up a lot of aspects of the game that we

3524
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
think are really important diablo is a game about killing monsters and getting loot and as i said

3525
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,000
before getting loot uh we need to make sure it feels at least as good as killing monsters right

3526
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
like it's extremely important that this part feels good and uh we took a lot of our development effort

3527
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
and put it against that that goal as part of this release and there were other parts to gain that we

3528
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
lifted up at the same time like the various changes that we talked about for for helltide for example

3529
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
you know the miri new tempering recipes and things like that there's lots of things we did

3530
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
i think as part of the release just make the base experience of diablo 4 more fun right so i'm

3531
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,000
really excited we're able to do that in season four thinking about what the future holds we always

3532
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:28,000
want to make sure that with every season now we are adapting to what we think the game needs at that

3533
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,000
time we think it's going to make for a better experience overall we we love the idea of seasonal

3534
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,000
powers i we we we've learned a lot of really really great stuff from the days of the barber all the

3535
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
way through the vampiric powers we got in season two and all the seneschal and construct stuff we

3536
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,000
we had in season three uh we have lots of big ideas for the future so but you know you will

3537
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
you will see seasonal powers again in the future and in different themes and mechanics as we go

3538
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,000
that's you know that's kind of our promise to you and with the things we have in terms of like the

3539
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
iron world's quest line and the various rewards you get changes we made to the season journey for

3540
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:03,000
like getting like all of those themed items uh those like uh those uh those various like kind of aspect

3541
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
builds together as you kind of progress through we want to keep building upon these mechanical elements

3542
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:12,000
as well at the same time they can continue to help lift up the experience so yeah we will we will we will be

3543
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
returning to seasonal powers in the future you know but with every season we want to make sure

3544
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
that we're doing what we think is to be up like lifting the game up uh the most the things that

3545
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,000
we think are most important at that time awesome um question from our i'll i'll bounce between some

3546
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
questions from chat and from our forums because we did have a thread up in our forums about uh okay

3547
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:35,000
specific questions but this one's from the forums this is from avalon um they're asking if uh because you

3548
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
know season three actually ran longer and season four itself had a ptr will season four actually be a

3549
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:46,000
shortened season or will it still be in a a standard size season they they weren't sure how ptr is

3550
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:53,000
actually affecting the time on it uh so ptr is is not as uh is not as impactful for the timing here we

3551
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
we we it's i think it's a slightly shorter season i think it's like like one week shorter or something

3552
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:02,000
i need to look at the date yeah and and i i will note like ptr the the reason why season three ran

3553
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:08,000
longer was because we wanted to make sure that we could get that ptr this was our first ptr um so it you

3554
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
know there's there's a little bit more effort into and needed to get that out for players yeah i

3555
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
guess i i guess you're you're absolutely right so like i think about like when i'm thinking about

3556
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
the future and like what ptrs look like we want things to be like we're it's not that like having

3557
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
a ptr automatically means that everything is going to take longer to deliver it's but there's a lot of

3558
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
things we had to set up for the first time the ptr for season four and i'm really glad that we did

3559
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
because as i think you've seen there's a lot of things we learned going through the process and give

3560
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
us the time to iterate and use the feedback too yeah which we did a lot of things on based on uh question from blake

3561
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:43,000
dark oscs uh will you guys think about maybe a potential different bean color for items with

3562
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:49,000
greater affixes uh so i know we talked about this for a while yeah yeah i think um that's something

3563
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,000
we're definitely going to keep an eye on like right now we think that the the little dots or the i should

3564
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,000
say huge dots the huge stars on them um are doing a pretty good job but you know that's something that we

3565
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
we also need to feel out and play and we're super open to feedback and seeing how these new big stars are

3566
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,000
going to help yeah um yeah the the change especially the changes in the inventory because like now you

3567
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
can actually identify them in your inventory and everything is really big these also roll on unique

3568
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:18,000
so there's a little bit of like work that we'll need to figure out um but again yeah it's true yeah

3569
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
you can get greater affix on unique as well yeah so it's like what yeah the beam color gets a little

3570
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:28,000
confusing there for you so something to that we'll monitor for sure and of course something that we've seen

3571
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,000
from players and a lot of people bringing that specifically up um fire dragon dad says that the season four

3572
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:39,000
update's going to retro into existing uh eternal so see everything we talked about today with the

3573
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:46,000
exception of the iron wolves quest line stuff is actually present in the eternal realm so um players

3574
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
like the codex power changes everything like that will be there i know there are a lot of questions

3575
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:55,000
related to like the codex changes especially for eternal players and just to clarify if you have aspects

3576
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
in your inventory and your stash you'll take whatever your highest role of that specific aspect and then

3577
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:08,000
that will become your your new best uh uh codex entry uh when season four does start you may need

3578
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
to log on to specific characters on eternal uh to at least like for us to be able to check your

3579
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:19,000
inventory but the stash i know will automatically move over there um and same thing for for uh i know

3580
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:24,000
we get a lot of questions about like items on eternal those will be marked as like legacy items specifically

3581
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
um because obviously we we've changed a lot of aspects and everything and those items you can't

3582
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
you can't craft on those items either at that point like you can't you can't temper those items and

3583
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
you can't masterwork those items but they'll still retain like the item upgrade state that they have

3584
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
in the blacksmith exactly so if you if it doesn't mean like when you log on all your gear is suddenly

3585
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
unusable it's just it's just marked as legacy and you wouldn't you won't be able to use uh tempering

3586
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
or masterwork it's a great stepping off point to getting some new items it could have greater

3587
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
affixes and other things that could be making even more powerful yeah yeah um a question that we

3588
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:59,000
have uh actually from uh the forums this is from iggy uh with the itemization reworked is there uh what

3589
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,000
is like the next like big thing you guys are actually looking at uh potentially wanting to uh really work

3590
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:11,000
on within the team uh i don't know if we want to play our cards too early yeah i think it's working on

3591
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,000
things we're working on all kinds of stuff everybody but no i i think one thing we want to continue to

3592
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:20,000
work on i think you see like as we're thinking more about the the end game experience a lot like

3593
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:25,000
when we when we launched diablo 4 we thought of end game really as a journey from like really from 50

3594
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
to 100 like the things you're doing along the way and getting off your preparer on glyphs and leveling

3595
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
those glyphs up and go diving deeper nightmare dungeons and you know going and eventually confronting

3596
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,000
low that was what we kind of imagined or thought that end game would feel like and that was a good

3597
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
thing for us to build on i think we saw that a lot more players were looking for end game like

3598
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
explicitly at level 100 that was when they wanted a lot more things to open up and we've made a lot of changes

3599
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
recently to try to like create more gameplay around that part of the experience between

3600
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,000
like the optimization changes and the crafting changes and also the introduction of like

3601
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
tormented bosses and of course uh the uh the pavio artificer yeah so i think that like we know that

3602
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
there's more opportunities for us to build on these things right like i think you've heard me say this

3603
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
before but you know a lot of things we're doing in season four specifically really are done to like

3604
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,000
build a new framework you know for how end game sort of functions the the things that drive a player

3605
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:14,000
for the things that get them excited that they and and the content that they engage with along

3606
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
the way as well right we want to make sure that they're having that players are having a really

3607
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
fun time or rewarding time while they're playing diablo 4 and they can find opportunities to be

3608
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
appropriately challenged as they go through the experience as well we think there's more

3609
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
opportunities for us to kind of like grow and expand uh the offerings of things that players

3610
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:35,000
have access to the things they can go experience you know at that stage of the game awesome uh question

3611
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:43,000
from old dudes new games uh and uh i love these names they're so good um what about codex resetting

3612
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
when swapping characters that was actually just an issue on ptr um like when you when you swapped

3613
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,000
characters and stuff like that sorry yeah when you swaps and you use the uh when you use the boost npc

3614
01:46:53,000 --> 01:47:00,000
yeah yeah yeah so that that was not a a thing that you will experience with season four uh and so you

3615
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
that's not a common thing or a normal thing that's supposed to actually happen uh it just was

3616
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:10,000
a bug that we had in ptr um there's a lot of questions here about um uh the mine cage and i

3617
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:17,000
just want to um maybe clarify with the the the players um opus crocus says if you consume more than

3618
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:24,000
one does the mine cage stack or does the timer reset timer reset i think the timer resets timer resets

3619
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:34,000
okay and then uh in regards to again uh this is from optics uh do cage or do mine cages

3620
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:41,000
trigger for a single player or your whole group if you're grouped up single player just a single

3621
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:47,000
player yeah it's a personal thing okay all right so clarity around the mine cage because i know we've

3622
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
had a lot of people ask specifically and we want feedback on this by the way too so when you get a

3623
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
chance to play with the mine cage during the season like you know yeah tell us what you think we want

3624
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:01,000
to know um this is from noopu games uh do unique items get a stat slash functionality boost since

3625
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:06,000
tempered legendaries are just straight up better and is it generally not worth it to equip a unique

3626
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
item after the patch yeah i mean uh i think adam can speak to some of these changes if you wanted to

3627
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:17,000
jump in but we've done a pass on all the unique items we've done things like uh razor plate i think

3628
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:22,000
has four thorns affixes and we changed what the legendary power is yeah by the way that was a big question we

3629
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:27,000
got from people ptr because they were like hey what about razor plate we heard a lot we had to

3630
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,000
change razor plate yeah it'll be cool and it's actually in the patch notes um and yeah it's a lot

3631
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,000
of thorns razor plates hilarious we still love it it's hilarious i wanted to just have like one so you

3632
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:43,000
can't miss on masterwork yeah but um yeah what i'll say though about the unique to legendary item power

3633
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
level i suppose is that we knew when we were making these temporary changes and updating those that

3634
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:52,000
we wanted legendaries because they kind of have a like they have kind of different identities right

3635
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
now in the game and so we're still figuring out what we want to do with uniques long term but the

3636
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:02,000
idea is that like legendary items or items really they have a journey and you know you're you're working

3637
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,000
on them and there's a story to them and you know you get it it's not like a one-stop shop you're done

3638
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,000
kind of like how they were before uniques a part of our identity is that that like you know you get a

3639
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:15,000
unique and it's freaking awesome and really powerful and very exciting and and you have it and you're done with

3640
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:21,000
it and so we're we're keeping this discrepancy of like what their purposes are in the game for now

3641
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,000
um and kind of seeing how it goes we did take a look at some uniques but we didn't like do a whole

3642
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
pass of like you know every single unique now has five outfixes or something like that like we wanted

3643
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,000
them to be a little bit different and different identities so we do kind of expect that uniques may

3644
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
be less prevalent than they were before we still believe though that a lot of uniques are really key for

3645
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,000
various builds and so you're still going to want them but you're not going to want like a unique in

3646
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
every single slot on your character now because there's clearly always better right sometimes

3647
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
some builds will want more unique some will want less and we want to kind of see how that plays

3648
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:57,000
first before making sweeping changes um you know some obvious roads we could take is like adding

3649
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
crafting to uniques what if you could temper them what if you can do these other things right like

3650
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,000
we know that that's a thing and we may do that in the future but we're kind of evaluating this world

3651
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:11,000
where it's not clearly always you only get one or the other and we kind of want to see how that goes

3652
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:17,000
first uh before making any big changes yeah and the fixed nature sort of has you consider it's

3653
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:22,000
part of your optimization puzzle yeah like well i'm going to give up some tempering affixes to get

3654
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,000
this unique for example in in my chess slot for example we sort of want to see where that goes like

3655
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:33,000
we think that that's that's fun and um we think that the excitement of a unique is is the are those

3656
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
fixed stats when you see the item on the ground you know like oh okay that's that's the unique i want

3657
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,000
i can just equip it i don't even have to work on it yeah it's just like there for me so um awesome

3658
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:50,000
and then i know by the way did we talk about uh master working or not mass working we did talk

3659
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:59,000
we've done it twice on youtube did we talk about groups and uh with the pit i didn't write it down

3660
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,000
and i didn't talk about it yeah yeah yeah so we we got a bunch of feedback um that you know it sucks to

3661
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,000
help someone with their pit run and just not get any master working material it's like well

3662
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:14,000
why am i here um so what we've done is we've made it so that the person who opens the pit is going to

3663
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:20,000
get 100 of the master working materials previously i think it was uh split maybe across all players

3664
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:26,000
and what we've done now is that the person who opens it gets 100 and then everyone who helps

3665
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:31,000
defeat the pit gets 50 of that target goal so we're trying to walk that line where group play isn't

3666
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
just like totally overwhelmingly efficient but you're still getting something for helping each

3667
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,000
other like go through those pit levels yeah we we heard a lot of feedback about players going like

3668
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:44,000
that feels a little unrewarding to yeah and so there were some changes in general there i think there's

3669
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
still some tension with how players feel about the efficiency of groups which is the efficiency of

3670
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
solo play with like boss summons and things like that these are things we're thinking about we have

3671
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
ideas on but we want to continue to get feedback particularly with these changes and kind of see how

3672
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:01,000
things play out absolutely awesome um we're getting questions about you know hey are there any updates on social

3673
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:07,000
features and and things like that coming to to d4 um don't know if we have anything to share right

3674
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:13,000
now right it's it's something obviously that team is very well you guys ask all the time so we and we're

3675
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:20,000
very very aware of it um and the team is is been looking at it and once we have more to share we'll end up

3676
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
sharing it with you guys but for right now we don't have any update yeah um it there's questions about it is

3677
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:31,000
is there if there's plans of adding maybe potential leaderboards to the pit or anything or or is that

3678
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
going to be something that's just exclusively on the gauntlet um i think the idea of adding leaderboards

3679
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
other types of content over time makes sense could be pretty fun you know but uh right now we really

3680
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:46,000
want to see how the pit plays on its own uh the you know the um trials feature on and challenge ladder

3681
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,000
like we really want that to be a place where players can or the other guys really want players to be able

3682
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,000
to like go and compete in a very fixed environment a very extremely fair environment which is like the

3683
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
what we really prioritize part of the release um the pit is pretty variable run to run so that makes

3684
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
it a little more complicated it doesn't mean that we would never add it i think that there's a clear

3685
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
indicator that there's it would be pretty fun to have this slightly looser leaderboard associated

3686
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
with a feature like this yeah yeah but we're gonna see how things play out and we'll be we'll be

3687
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:16,000
thinking about how we can add more competitive features like that to the game over time um question from

3688
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:23,000
elro here and i didn't pronounce that right but uh uh uh when i wrote here i think that is actually yeah nailed it

3689
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
uh it's like an elven time right now not since not everyone actually experienced ptr because ptr itself

3690
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,000
was on pc battle net but uh they're asking when tempering can you keep previous roles can you keep

3691
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:40,000
previous roles oh like the enchanting system oh i see yeah yeah currently right now we don't have the

3692
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
functionality to let you keep the rule right now if you're going to commit to re-rolling you're going

3693
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
to lose that you're committing to rolling yeah it's sort of like the blacksmith is hammering on that item

3694
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
and unlocking different aspects of the weapon you sort of lose what you previously had but we're

3695
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
open to feedback right it's completely new feature really want to hear how it's playing and then

3696
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:01,000
ultimately what we want is a fun crafting feature so if uh you know that that sort of feedback is really

3697
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:07,000
valuable uh we'll take two more and one is from matt lol is uh temporary going to allow changes for the

3698
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:14,000
skills uh the skill type like maybe lightning hydras or maybe changes to blizzard where it's a rain of fire

3699
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:20,000
or something like that that's pretty cool honestly anything an apex can do yeah it is open season

3700
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,000
of things we could potentially do in the future yeah not not in season four but you know possibly in

3701
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:31,000
the future awesome um and i this is actually from a lot of space to grow there is utility is a category

3702
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:37,000
we can yeah there's a lot of things potentially yeah yeah um there's a lot of questions in here about like

3703
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:43,000
additional character customization options and stuff like that coming in the future it is like something

3704
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,000
the team is always looking at adding additional things to for players to have more choice of what

3705
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
they want to do especially as they're creating characters um and of course uh being able to obtain

3706
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,000
those like even just some things in season four of being able to get additional you know cosmetic

3707
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,000
things for your mount and everything like that is something that uh the the team is most definitely

3708
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:09,000
looking yeah we we actually we care about this a great deal um i think one thing that's very interesting

3709
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,000
uh about uh diablo 4 or a problem that we have that's very specific right is um there are actually

3710
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
quite a few cosmetics for players to earn out on bosses and things like throughout the game like

3711
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
there's there's lots of things for players to collect cosmetically in the game um but it's really hard to

3712
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:28,000
know that that drops off that thing yeah in diablo 4 like you can go and you could fight like a world

3713
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
boss 50 times and not have a uh a drop occur for you right like then eventually get your special horse

3714
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:38,000
like oh okay it is here but you have no idea it's kind of like it's harder to know exactly where to grind we're actually

3715
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
talking about that a bit on the uh on the dev side see if like there's more ways we can kind of like

3716
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
make it clear where certain things can be found which i think would be really fun yeah uh but i

3717
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
think that there's work we can do there and also there's still work we can do about just trying to

3718
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
get more cool looks into the game so we've been talking a lot more with the various teams inside

3719
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:00,000
inside diablo 4 and there's a broad agreement we want to bring more cool stuff to you guys and more

3720
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
cool stuff for players to find and and pick up and equip and feel like it was really exciting to get that thing

3721
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:10,000
uh one thing we're doing like already is we're like as we develop more uniques we're trying to make sure we have

3722
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
like more unique appearances to go with all of them we usually have like a lot of really really fun ideas

3723
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
we have what we have to constantly like wrestle with like all right we we only have like this x x many swords

3724
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:23,000
but like we have like this many ideas for swords and we want to try to get this in the game we want to wait

3725
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
till we have the artwork for a sword we will usually try to make sure we've got a fun toy to immediately give you

3726
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:31,000
uh but we're going to make sure we're trying to get more of that stuff in game as well so there's just even more

3727
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:37,000
artwork to the unique system for players to collect awesome so that's all the time we got right here
