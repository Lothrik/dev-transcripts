222
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000

223
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000

228
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Stream, stream.

229
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Stream, stream.

230
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Stream, stream.

231
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Stream, stream.

232
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Stream, stream.

233
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Stream, stream.

234
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Stream, stream.

235
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Stream, stream.

236
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Stream, stream.

237
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Stream, stream.

238
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Stream, stream.

239
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Stream, stream.

240
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Tempering is a new system that allows you to really customize the gear that you find.

241
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
In order to temper, you will need to go to the blacksmith and then choose the recipe that you wish temper from.

242
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And then a random aphics from that recipe will be attached onto your gear.

243
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Tempering recipes can be found from almost all of the content throughout sanctuaries.

244
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So you will actually be looking for tempering recipes that go directly with what you're envisioning.

245
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
They're all going to be recipes that are more generic and maybe are just generally good for the sorceress,

246
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
but you'll be able to choose which one you think is going to be most powerful with the build you're making for your class.

247
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:40,000
We're making a pretty radical change to the codex of power in this season, based again on the feedback that has been coming from our players.

248
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Every single legendary in the game will be entered into your codex of power so that you can continually imprint the best possible version of that legendary onto your gear.

249
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So going forward, there will no longer be carrying around all of these aspect crystals in your inventory.

250
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's all going to be in the codex of power.

251
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So part of the final system that we have is going to be greater aphics.

252
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What's a greater aphics?

253
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Well, we want to keep it compelling that there are some drops that are even better than the others when you're trying to get the perfect build at endgame.

254
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Because of this, in World Tier 4 and only in World Tier 4, when an ancestral legendary item drops, there's a chance the aphics is on it can roll as greater aphics is.

255
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
These will roll with bigger values that are normally available for that aphics.

256
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Greater aphics are fairly rare, but they're not impossible to find.

257
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
While leveling up, you're going to be able to find upgrades much more easily with this new system.

258
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Another part of itemization is going to be master working.

259
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Now this is something really intended for that very high endgame, again, World Tier 4.

260
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
This is where a player is going to take an item.

261
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
R.E. has the aphics that they won on it, but now they go through a process of upgrading those aphics.

262
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Getting even higher values on them.

263
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Master working really starts at level 100.

264
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Once you've already completed your build and found some of the best items, you're going to be able to test your build against powerful enemies of the pit.

265
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The pit is a new endgame system that has been added in this season, that is going to challenge players that feel that they have largely maximize their build.

266
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
By pushing into more difficult tiers of the pit, you're going to be able to unlock rare crafting materials to master work your gear even further.

267
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You're going to have to play some of the hardest content in the game, but once you do, if you're successful, you can go and make those aphics even stronger.

268
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:56,000
In season 4, we're ramping the intensity of the health tides through the inclusion of a variety of new activities, the first of which is a doubling down and rise of the cultists presence throughout the tide.

269
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You're going to be running through the health tides, saying the cultists just conjuring up swarms and swarms of demons, adding to that sense of manic and chaos that they're pretty well known for.

270
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The other archetype that we're adding is the presence of the Doomsayers, who were unfortunate enough to be caught out in the tide and basically just lost their minds to all of the mania going on around them.

271
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And lastly, rounding out the new activities are just the inclusion of the iron wolves. They're finally joined the fight, it could no longer stand in the sidelines, seeing the health tides and health forces intensify their assault on sanctuary.

272
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:49,000
As season 4 players engage and progress through the called the wolves seasonal activity, they'll earn honor with the iron wolves, unlocking access to a vast assortment of rewards to accompany and empower your season 4 journeys.

273
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
In the updated health tides for players who are able to stay alive long enough, they'll be paid a visit by the Hellbarn.

274
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Former heroes of sanctuary who have aligned with the forces of hell to attack the allies they once aligned with.

275
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Players who are able to take down the Hellbarn will be acquiring the materials they need to engage with the new premier, Haltide activity, the accursed rituals.

276
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Located in the Helltide, these accursed rituals are pretty much just botched rituals from the cultists that players will be kickstarting for themselves, drawing the intention of all the nearby Helltide monsters in this kind of all-out battle.

277
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:38,000
One of my favorite themes for these ambushes is the Hellworm. It's literally a giant hell slug beast that emerges from the ground but it spews out a whole bunch of mobs at you.

278
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,000
If you're able to survive that, you'll be paid a visit from the Blood Maiden, our brand new Helltide mini-boss and one of the ultimate challenges in the new experience.

279
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So I think I'm actually most excited about this season because of what you're able to do with your old characters, how they can integrate with this new item game and take them to new levels of power with this system.

280
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I think that the best part of this update is that you're going to be really empowered to build the character that you want to play.

281
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You're going to be able to pick custom affixes and enhance your character in a lot of new and interesting ways.

282
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Alright.

283
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We were just watching a video and they were all like,

284
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Hey guys, how's it going? Welcome to another Diablo 4 developer update live stream. My name is Adam Pledgeur.

285
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I am the community director here for Diablo. I'm joined by this wonderful panel plus an additional head which we will haul out.

286
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We have four seats.

287
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We have to do the same thing we did during the PTR stream which was like we swapped out like Joe Shelley, I put in Adam Jackson.

288
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
That's true. We're going to play more magic tricks today. Do you guys want to do a quick intro to yourself to the wonderful Diablo community?

289
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Sure. I'm Joe Pippora on the associate game director for Diablo 4.

290
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
And I'm Adam Jackson, the lead live class designer for Diablo 4. And we have a new face.

291
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm Colin Feiner. I'm the lead live game designer. Awesome. And then we're actually going to be joined by Derek.

292
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
For you.

293
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Well, I already introduced myself. He dismissed it because he's an artist. I'm just going to swap her while terrible.

294
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's my first break.

295
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But we actually have Derek who will be joining us as well. Derek, you just saw in the video prior talking about season 4.

296
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
He'll be swapping in to talk a little bit more about halterd's later in this.

297
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But big stream here. We have season 4 coming up. As you guys saw earlier this week, it is luke reborn for season 4.

298
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
And a lot of players actually got to experience it a couple weeks ago with PTR.

299
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
This was our first Diablo 4. PTR was a massive undertaking from the team here.

300
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But it was really, really great to have players jump in early.

301
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Check out season 4 and all the changes and actually provide feedback.

302
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And so we have a lot to cover today based off of feedback that we received from players from PTR itself.

303
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But Joe, I know you wanted to jump into kind of talking a little bit more about season 4, how PTR went before we jump into all the changes.

304
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah, happy to.

305
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, okay. So last time we were on stream, we were actually talking about a lot of the changes that players were going to get.

306
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So we just had to check out on the PTR. So we think that went really, really well.

307
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It was just having the week of time for players to just jump in and just crush through all the content.

308
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Check out all the new features and it gets a lot of feedback. Find a lot of bugs on the way as well.

309
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It was again super valuable. It's been really, really great for the team.

310
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
We'll take a lot of these, this feedback. Look at the tuning variety of features.

311
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And really make sure that we've got the best version of the season 4 experience ready when we get into the launch state.

312
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So, in terms of our big takeaways, first of all, really, really valuable across the board.

313
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Season 4, season 3, we were born was, as I mentioned, during the PTR stream originally, was really our opportunity to go back and take a lot of feedback in that we've been looking at since the launch of the game from 2023.

314
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Sorry, it is so good.

315
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I do love the KERK for this KERK for season 3 was awesome as well.

316
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So, look you back at the launch. Thanks for disrupting my flow.

317
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Thanks for watching.

318
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Thanks for watching.

319
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Thank you so much.

320
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Look you back at the launch of the project in 2023.

321
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
We got a lot of really good feedback.

322
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Remember back in season 2, season 2, we made a big change to vulnerable damage and the multiplicative damage that comes along with it made a change to the way the elements of resist worked.

323
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
There were a lot of things we had to do to make those changes really shine through.

324
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
There were a lot of Paragon nodes that had to get updated.

325
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There were a lot of like, allegatory aspects that had to get changed.

326
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
There was a lot of itemization stuff in the background.

327
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
We had to do to make those systems work better and lift up other things around them like overpower, for example, to make that feel like it was in a better spot.

328
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:11,000
So, now that we're looking at, even when we're done that one big release for season of blood, we knew that there's a lot more that we wanted to do.

329
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Again, we've been thinking about.

330
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
But there's a lot of work we need to do to make sure that all of these things really all fit together cohesively.

331
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
So, as people got a chance to see on the PTR, the introduction of things like the tempering feature, which we're going to talk a little bit more in a minute,

332
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
we need to introduce these new affixes into items.

333
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And, affixes you can't get at items anymore.

334
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The reduction, affix, count on items overall.

335
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So, it's a lot easier to go and sort through 25 pairs of gloves in your inventory at any given time.

336
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You don't really have those same situations.

337
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
We reduced the number of items that drop in the game experience overall, but made sure that the items that are dropping are just more valuable and more likely to be upgrades for you,

338
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
or something you could kind of like build into an upgrade.

339
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We introduced the master working feature, right?

340
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And Colin helps out a lot of these things up right during, well, working with the teams.

341
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So, they introduced the master working feature where players can continually upgrade items to increase the value of the affixes,

342
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and then it ranks 4 and 8 and 12 until I kind of crit on one of these and make them even better.

343
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Now, there's a lot of things we're introduced.

344
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We add the new content type in the form of the Pity Artifester.

345
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's like this new extremely deep and deadly dungeon dive players get to go into once they get into the, towards the end game,

346
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
when you're going to like, you know, 85, 90, your character level, you're starting to kind of dip into that space.

347
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And that's where you go to get your master working materials, which feels really, really good.

348
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And we learned a lot of really great lessons from like greater riffs in Diablo 3,

349
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
which is really cool content there.

350
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's really, really fun things there.

351
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Also, the codex of power updates, you know, long time to save all your legendaries all the time.

352
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Codex of power updates, which I would like to be fair, I've been so excited about the codex of power updates.

353
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I've been teasing it for like six livestreams.

354
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Like, I feel like I teased it at the end of a livestream.

355
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So, just what it is.

356
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But again, super excited about the codex of power changes.

357
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That is very transformational.

358
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Like now, when legendary drops on the ground for you, you just salvage it, you get that aspect.

359
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And then you're codex at the role that you got.

360
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And you just get to use it in perpetuity.

361
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And we actually have some fun ways.

362
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
We'll talk about later how we're playing with that a little bit as we go.

363
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So, I mean, all of this stuff and more, we made huge, huge changes to Hellside.

364
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I know Derek's been talking about it in a little while.

365
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I see, he helped lead the team, did a lot of work for that.

366
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And we got to introduce the season theme in the form of like looper-borne.

367
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And then the reintroduction of the animals mercenaries, the players,

368
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
be working with during the course of the police.

369
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And I know that we showed a little bit of that off earlier.

370
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And I am just, personally, I was really, really excited about the release overall.

371
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
As this was an opportunity for us to work with like not just the season team,

372
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
but also the live team and the live loss work from the systems groups.

373
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And there's a lot of things being done for the expansion.

374
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That's coming out eventually as well, like Vessel hatred.

375
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So, being able to like, really organize teams and make sure that we're in a really, really good spot

376
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
to like provide this really big update for the game.

377
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It has been very, very exciting.

378
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And the feedback, going back to the feedback.

379
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The feedback from PTR was again really, really valuable.

380
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It was great to get players in there and to get those things to take care.

381
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And we're going to talk about some of those things today.

382
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I know that some of this information has been like,

383
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
we talked to like a few, like press outlets, we talked to a few different people,

384
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and like some information is getting out there.

385
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But I want to make sure we can provide a little bit more detail, you know,

386
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
because I know this is the audience wants to know like the real specifics.

387
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We're going to get into it, right?

388
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And we'll also have our Q&A as we usually do at the end.

389
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
We'll be able to get like, answer some more questions the community might have

390
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
as we kind of give them the whole thing.

391
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So, yeah, that was the, at a high level,

392
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
that's what we were feeling about the PTR, feeling pretty good about it.

393
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm happy to like maybe jump into itemization or how do we go?

394
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah, I think the first thing we probably want to talk about is like,

395
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
the itemization changes that are in season four,

396
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
that people experience, which includes like the tempering,

397
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
the master working stuff that changed in season four.

398
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And of course, all the feedback that we got from both tempering,

399
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
master working and what we are planning on doing based off of that PTR

400
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
feedback for the launches season four.

401
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And we've got a few updates.

402
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, lots.

403
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah, sure.

404
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So, I guess just starting off then with like high level itemization.

405
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Like, let's go back to like some of the goals that we had.

406
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And we start like down on this, start some of the work for season four.

407
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Now, we want to make sure that first players were having an easier time

408
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
comparing items in their inventory.

409
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah.

410
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's actually one of the first things we started thinking about.

411
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
We began discussing what we thought needed to change about the itemization

412
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
because the experience in season three and season two and other seasons

413
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
has really been like the player, you know, you're getting to like the,

414
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
you know, you're running your high tier nightmare dungeons.

415
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You're getting lots of drops.

416
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You know, you're sorting through all of this stuff.

417
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Like, you'll have like items that are like, you know,

418
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
this is like a 904 iPower sword.

419
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
This is a 909 iPower sword.

420
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Now, I've got like six helmets at all or like a wide variety of

421
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
affixes on them.

422
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
We really wanted again just to quickly hit this.

423
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
We wanted to make sure that we had a lower number of affixes overall

424
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
that could roll on different item slots.

425
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But those affixes were more like generically useful and stuff you could

426
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
really build around as opposed to having lots of really conditional affixes

427
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
going back to like the, you know, the damage on Tuesdays joke, you know,

428
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
like that's the shirt that the shirt that you want to run away.

429
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Literally wearing it now.

430
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's always funny.

431
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It's a huge proponent.

432
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's always funny.

433
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So it's obviously because it's a joke, right?

434
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, jokes are always funny.

435
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But the truth is like we want to make sure that that the,

436
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
where we want to have conditional affixes in the game, we want to find

437
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
place players would be able to opt into them in a very specific way.

438
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You know, so, so initially want items that you're either really dropping

439
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
for you to have more generic utility, just be just more valuable for

440
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
you overall.

441
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And also as a result of this, make it easier to compare those items.

442
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So one of the changes that we made is we actually reduced the number of affixes,

443
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
the affixes that can naturally roll on item slots.

444
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
So like now, like, you know, a rare item can roll like two affixes,

445
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
a legendary egg to roll three affixes.

446
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But then later on, there's other systems you get to introduce,

447
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
you will talk about a bit, you'll actually introduce more of those.

448
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah.

449
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And we did that.

450
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So it's just easier to go through things.

451
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We also made all items post level 195.

452
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So you're no longer comparing like the designer number that's like 904 to 925.

453
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You're just focusing on what's cool about the item, which is the affixes.

454
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah, which is super important because there's a lot of situations where like,

455
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
if you're, if you're level 100, like blood harvest might be a lot of fun,

456
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
but blood harvest is still dropping like 5 power, 900 items for you.

457
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yeah.

458
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And at that point, what's the, why would you want to keep even blood harvest,

459
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
which players really love?

460
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Like, why would you want to keep engaging with it if you can't get really good end game items for that?

461
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Yeah.

462
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So now when you're like at level 100 and you're playing in Helltide,

463
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
or if you're going through Nightmare Dungeons, like a regular, like a slightly lower tier,

464
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and you're fighting, level 100 monsters are higher, you're always getting IPAR 925 items.

465
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
They might not have all exactly the stats or exactly the roles that you want,

466
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
but you're always getting stuff you could actually potentially use.

467
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah.

468
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
A lot of the things fill up better too, like gambling, right?

469
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Like now gambling is actually a really great source for targeting items a lot,

470
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
because all of those are 925 at level 100.

471
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That's right.

472
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So like the Obel's you've been sitting on, where you go and you just churn through a whole bunch of these at once,

473
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
they didn't have as much generic value.

474
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Now, there's, they're a lot better because you really can't just like say,

475
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I am looking for a helmet.

476
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I am looking for a ring, and you can just go roll, you know, 10 IPAR 925 rings in a row,

477
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
and you have stuff to play with at that point.

478
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So yeah, those were some of the, like the high level changes you wanted to make with items,

479
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
with the garts, like making it easier to compare these things.

480
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Codex, it's a lot like the, lovey, the inventory concerns,

481
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
we'd have made changes to gems in previous seasons,

482
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
so we didn't have as many of them clogging up your inventory as well.

483
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So that was, we thought that was really, really good stuff.

484
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But then we knew that we want to make sure that the,

485
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
that it wasn't just about, like, we weren't going to like add another tier of IPARPed items.

486
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That wasn't the way to make itemization more interesting for players and rewards more interesting.

487
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Now, one of the core things that we really wanted to focus around was the idea that, like,

488
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
like items have a journey, the best items have a journey, right?

489
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So when you get a really good items about the, what the potential of that item is,

490
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
you know, what you can do with this item to make it really superior, right?

491
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah, definitely.

492
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And that, that's sort of, to jump into tempering.

493
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yeah.

494
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah.

495
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
One of the first features we had in terms of taking your item on a journey was this idea that

496
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
we wanted hundreds of different affixes,

497
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and each one spoke differently to a build.

498
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We wanted you to be able to play sort of whatever class fantasy or build fantasy you had in mind,

499
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and manifest that through customization of your items.

500
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So we actually have some video, I think, of what the tempering feature looks like,

501
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and I can talk through some of the updates we've made from the PTR.

502
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So here you have, you know, we're adding an offensive affix to the item.

503
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's going to land on increased corpse explosion damage.

504
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's like, yeah, that's pretty cool, especially if you really like corpse explosion.

505
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
We've added a skip button, so you can skip through the flow if you really want to blast through this.

506
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,000
We also have a result screen now that shows you exactly what affix it landed on and what the roll range was.

507
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And then we have some more exciting affixes that you're going to see here, for example,

508
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
chance to cast Bone Spear Projectile twice, which I know Adam is your favorite,

509
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
because I love the Balanced Bomb Drop.

510
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I love that.

511
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It is cool though, but you'll be able to...

512
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Oh, there he is here.

513
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So, yeah, we did our swap.

514
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
But Joe's not going to be here off screen.

515
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
We just want to make sure that Derek appears here.

516
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Derek is our lead seasons designer, so he'll be talking a little bit more about Helltide Fliter.

517
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Sorry to interject.

518
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Okay, go ahead, Joe.

519
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So, yeah, the snap off screen.

520
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So, yeah, I think one of the really cool things about the tempering system in general

521
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
is that like the manuals that we're introducing initially are just like the beginning of what we can do with tempering.

522
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It's actually just to make like really weird and interesting new affixes to kind of throw the player that we can introduce these in,

523
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
or another updates.

524
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So, it's something that we can really extend and do some really neat stuff with.

525
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah, we absolutely plan to build a lot in the future.

526
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Yeah.

527
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Awesome.

528
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah, so a bunch of improvements to tempering overall.

529
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah.

530
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And a lot of these...

531
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Again, these improvements in tempering from the skip animations to the previews and stuff like that,

532
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
that players will see.

533
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
We're based off of feedback that we actually got from PTR.

534
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah.

535
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And so, again, huge shout out to the community for providing all that feedback for us so that we can actually get that in before the launch of season 4.

536
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So, but with tempering, we also have Masterworking, which is another new feature within season 4, and permanently within Diablo 4 itself.

537
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So, talk us through a little bit about what Masterworking is, and of course the changes as well that we're going to be seeing based off of PTR feedback.

538
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Sure, yeah.

539
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So, you know, the next step in your items journey is to really take it to New Heights.

540
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You've customized it.

541
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You've found some base affixes you're really into.

542
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And we want it to give you a way to essentially take some of these affixes to new levels.

543
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So, you think about Helms and CDR or cooldown reduction, or for example, that chance to replicate your bone spear.

544
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
You want you to be able to really juice those stats.

545
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
So, I think we have a video here of what that looks like.

546
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You know, overall, what we've really done is taken a look at the feedback.

547
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
We got a bunch of feedback that it was tedious to upgrade these over and over.

548
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So, we've removed the animation from ranks 1 through 3.

549
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
We've kept the critical upgrade.

550
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We have the animation still there, but you can skip it.

551
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You know, again, sort of in the spirit of blasting across everything that we do.

552
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So, we can do that very quickly.

553
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And another piece of feedback that we got was that, you know, part of the Masterworking process allows you to reset this.

554
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And why do you want to reset this? It's because you want to hit that specific affix or looking for you want to juice a specific affix.

555
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And sometimes you might miss, right, which means you want to reset that item.

556
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So, part of the resetting sort of requires you to get lower tier materials.

557
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You're going to get these from the pivot. We'll talk about that a little bit later.

558
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But overall, we saw a bunch of feedback that was really tedious to create like a thousand caches and open up them in town like a hundred times.

559
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's super annoying. The town is lava. We want to address that.

560
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So, you know, we've added multiple scales of material conversion to those caches.

561
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
This is a short-term solution. We have something in the future planned. It's just not ready yet.

562
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So, you know, while it's not the perfect solution, it does get you there a little bit quicker.

563
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:11,000
There's multiple conversion rates of materials. So, you can turn, you know, one legendary material into a much higher count of materials based on the tiers that we have in that crafting system.

564
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Again, not the perfect solution. We have something coming in a future update.

565
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Cool. Awesome. So, yeah, a lot of changes coming for master working based off of feedback.

566
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Master working, of course, being a brand new kind of that entail of that item journey that you'll have even after tempering and stuff like that.

567
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah. I was saying another thing that was brought to Sphere was about veiled crystals, right?

568
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yeah. Didn't we lose the amount that you need for crafting?

569
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
We did. We did. And I can totally talk about some of the stuff we've done just overall on itemization.

570
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Veiled crystals is one of those things.

571
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah. So, I'll talk about, first, I want to touch on rare and magic items.

572
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That was something we made a change from season three and season four legendary items are just generally straight up better than rare items now.

573
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And part of our goal there is really to ensure that players aren't sifting through sand, looking through thousands of items.

574
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
We want to just call it out, like legendary items or legendary.

575
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,000
At the same time, we acknowledge that there is some coolness to knowing that certain magic and rare items could have value to you.

576
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:25,000
We don't have anything for season four yet, but the design team is definitely talking about ways that we can bring this rarity back in a way that doesn't diminish our overall goal of trying to reduce that sort of sifting through sand.

577
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So, in the meantime, they can be salvaged. They still have a use in the end game.

578
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
But we heard a ton of feedback to your point out on the Veiled crystals.

579
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's just such a bottle neck and it's like, God damn it, I have to pick a bunch of yellow items up.

580
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Did you do any of the cool crafting features? What the hell was it?

581
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
That's an actual player quote too.

582
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yeah, I think they're very sure.

583
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So, what we've done is we've made it so that legendaries break down into equal amounts of Veiled crystals.

584
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So, you can just not pick up yellow items. It's just a bonus now.

585
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,000
We've also made sacred and ancestral items break down into two and three amounts of salvage.

586
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So, sacred items will break down into double and sush roll will break down into triple.

587
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So, we're effectively tripling the output of a lot of the salvage here.

588
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And I know, so that one, that was probably the most vocal feedback that we got from players.

589
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Maybe a little bit.

590
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Yeah, but I need more Veiled crystals.

591
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So, I know there's changes coming for that in season four based off that PTR feedback.

592
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Another, probably maybe the second, maybe also the first one, topmost,

593
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
our largest feedback piece that we got is around greater affixes and visibility related to those.

594
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So, there are changes going into that for season four.

595
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So, Vaughan, do you want to talk a little bit about that?

596
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Yeah, we want to, you know, the dopamine.

597
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
That was a big goal also of part of itemization is just like seeing an item hit the ground and just feeling like that jackpot moment.

598
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah, that's really important.

599
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So, we actually have some video here to show of what that actually looks like on the ground.

600
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So, you can see here's the weirdly long named items.

601
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
We're pretty good on this.

602
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah, right.

603
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
A yielding commander, sacrificial sickle.

604
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I know, right?

605
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

606
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So, we have a one greater affix star.

607
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
It'll go up to three or four if it's a unique item, which always feels incredible.

608
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So, it shows up on the ground when it lands.

609
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And then if we can go to the next video, we actually have an indicator now when it is in the inventory.

610
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah, so you can see it.

611
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
What is the difference?

612
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It's a tree that's nice.

613
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Right.

614
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I was ever joke, and it looks so good.

615
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm so happy.

616
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I'm disappointed.

617
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I can't see like the pixels.

618
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's not too great.

619
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, so that's been enormously helpful.

620
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And really, when you kill like Durel or one of these tormented bosses,

621
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and they drop a ton of loot on the ground to see some of these have stars on them,

622
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
it just is a feel great moment.

623
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Yeah, and it goes to what they're whole like not sitting through the sand.

624
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You clearly see that icon.

625
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You know that has value.

626
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You know what that value looks like.

627
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You know what that means.

628
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Especially, again, even on the icon itself, like in your inventory, you will immediately know those are my greater.

629
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Five Aphics items.

630
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And Long gone are the days of the Roman numeral.

631
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
We already knew that.

632
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We already knew that.

633
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Even like people who designed this really well.

634
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
It's funny.

635
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I think internally we knew like, that's probably going to change.

636
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We had a few jokes about that.

637
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Sure.

638
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I know one thing I want to touch on real quick before I move on the automation, if that's OK.

639
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Yeah.

640
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We actually, to touch on the build crystals, I think players are going to want to know this is

641
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
we reduce the imprinting cost of aspects quite a bit.

642
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
That's really going to help the build crystals as well.

643
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I think it went from like 75 build crystals to imprint on an ancestral armor to 16.

644
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah, that's a pretty huge swing.

645
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
You're just getting way more of your aspects on here.

646
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It's a lot more flexible.

647
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So, that's it.

648
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
We really want people to feel like, you know, this is kind of the code of subpar updates in general,

649
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
which I'm really pumped about, is we want you to feel like you're able to reimprint those aspects.

650
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah.

651
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
It's something that you're not having a huge cost or a huge barrier to doing.

652
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Right.

653
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Because as you upgrade your gear, that should be part of your process is like putting on their favorite affixes.

654
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Yeah.

655
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So, a lot of changes coming with tempering, master working, itemization.

656
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And I know, do we have any other changes that you wanted to cover before we move on to the next section?

657
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And I've got this like this novel in front of me.

658
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Yeah.

659
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It was a key struggle.

660
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh, one I would think is worth mentioning.

661
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Calling me wants to talk about is the master working.

662
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I remember we got a lot of feedback about the fail chance.

663
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Oh, that's a great one.

664
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh, that's a great one.

665
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Oh, yeah, this is one of the fail chance.

666
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
We took a lot of fun and fun and fun and that was like probably the biggest thing, right?

667
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That was the first bullet and I somehow missed it.

669
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

670
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So, we definitely felt like there's a ton of feedback that the double random chance was just a little bit too much.

671
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And we agreed, so we just took it out.

672
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It's just fun now.

673
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Just upgrade the item.

674
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
We adjusted the material costs a bit, but the fail chance is no longer there.

675
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Yeah.

676
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Awesome.

677
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Cool.

678
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So, we're going through those changes.

679
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
We'll actually be back to Colin here later because he still has more to talk about from his novel.

680
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yeah.

681
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
A paper study as he won the swap.

682
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
A paper pair.

683
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But we did want to jump into some of the class balance changes that are coming after PTR, of course, with season four.

684
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
We have a lot of class balance changes that are on top of all these itemization changes.

685
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
And we got a lot of great feedback from players.

686
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So, Mr. Adam Jackson.

687
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You very much did.

688
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yes.

689
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I love my slides.

690
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
We have got three categories of things that I'm going to be talking about today.

691
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Again, thanks to everybody for playing on the PTR.

692
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
We did get a ton of feedback.

693
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'm not going to go over the specifics of everything that changed, but I'm going to go over kind of the categories of things just because there's a whole lot of changes.

694
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
One of the first big ones was end game survivability issues.

695
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So, this is kind of talking about those people that went really far into the pit.

696
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
And this is kind of something that's been happening online as well that we want to address.

697
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And there's this phenomenon when you get really deep into the game and you're fighting high level monsters where you know you'll hit a point where the monsters are kind of easy and you're able to blow through with your really powerful builds.

698
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And then you kind of get to a point where they start one shot in you.

699
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And it can be kind of mysterious and hard to understand like what's going on. Why did this happen?

700
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
We've also had some issues balancing that kind of top end survivability when you get to those hard monsters in the game.

701
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
One of the reasons for this is that variability in player defense of this has been really high traditionally.

702
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
This is why when you look at the new items in the game in season four, you don't see a damage reduction very much at all.

703
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It's a very premium stat now that's really hard to get.

704
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And it's to help solve this problem of when someone is stacking all damage reduction versus someone who has none of it, their difference in effective health and survivability is really, really high.

705
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And so it makes it hard to balance the game.

706
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Another part that we wanted to hit was really armor.

707
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
That armor is kind of a really confusing stat. It's not really well understood how it works.

708
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I'm going to be going over it a little bit how it works and what we're changing to kind of adjust both of these issues a little bit.

709
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Next is that some stats can get really high.

710
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You know we added all these crazy awesome stats and you know you can juice them with master working and crit them and all these things.

711
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And it allowed for some really crazy things on the PTR which people love to post constantly.

712
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I mean and we to be clear we like crazy things you know it's it's awesome to get powerful and have that fantasy.

713
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,000
We do have to take into account things like combat clarity and computer performance to make sure that you know the game can still run very well for everybody.

714
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
So we made some changes there to adjust that.

715
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You mean it's not fun to just not see your the screen.

716
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I think it's for a little while.

717
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's hilarious I think.

718
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's funny for a bit but when you can always see like patches of ground.

719
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And one player can do that let alone when you get four of them in a group.

720
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And last but not least you know balance changes and bug fixes I'll be going over some of them but there's way more than what I'm covering right now today.

721
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But just know like we took a lot of feedback on balance a lot of feedback on bugs.

722
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,000
There were a lot of them that were reported and we we acted on a lot of them and I'll give an example of something that we did.

723
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
All right so let's go into armor.

724
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So brief history lesson or description how armor works today.

725
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
This is like when you log in how how armor is functioning makes your staff or physical damage mitigation.

726
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
So you know how you have your elemental resistance that caps at 75 and then can get pushed up a little bit.

727
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Armor reduces your physical resistance up to a cap of 85% that can't go higher than that.

728
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So that's the number. But what's confusing is the amount of armor that you need to get to that 85% cap is actually based on the level of the monster that you're fighting.

729
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
And I gave some examples here. This is these are the actual numbers in the game.

730
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So if you have a level 50 monster that's hitting you you know whacking you then you need 5,265 armor and then you'll be out that 85% cap.

731
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But then at level 100 and every level of you know like 51, 52, 53 is good.

732
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That number is going up of what you need.

733
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And at level 100 it's about you know 9,230 and then at level 150 monster it gets close to 13,000 right.

734
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And so what this ends up you know kind of creating is that the player really never knows when they're done with armor right that that number can scale up forever.

735
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's kind of a hidden system under the hood. So when you're fighting these monsters and they get way higher level than you as you scale into the pit or nightmare dungeons or whatever.

736
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You don't really know how much you need. And so this is kind of really contributing to that phenomenon where you're fine.

737
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
You're at the cap and then you aren't you know the higher level monster just start one shot in you.

738
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So in season four, a lot of us can be the same as season three.

739
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It's still going to be your source of physical damage mitigation. The cap is still going to be 85% and you're still going to need escalating amounts of armor as the monster level gets higher.

740
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:39,000
But what we're changing here if we go forward a little bit is that armor is now going to cap at that level 100 monster number.

741
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So that 9,230 you can write down this number. We're also going to later get into the tool tip.

742
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
We couldn't get it in for the long season four, but we'll have it soon after.

743
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,000
But it's kind of going to be like elemental resistance where you get to this number and then you're kind of done with the system right.

744
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So armor is just another thing on your check box of things you want to do as far as defensive survivability.

745
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And once you get it, you're done. You know you can get it from gear, legendary aspects and so on.

746
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Particularly in season four, I think this will be a little bit of an easy number to hit.

747
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
We're not trying to make this super difficult or hard to do. It'll be very achievable for you when you're a level 100 player.

748
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So here we have a zoom in on the tool tips so you can see this player has you know way above that 9,000 amount of armor that they need.

749
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You know they have close to 16,000, but you can see there, you know, it's capped out of that 85% physical resistance.

750
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And again soon after the long season four, we're going to actually put the cap that you need of the number that you're chasing.

751
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Because we want you to know what the goal is that you're trying to hit.

752
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So means they have a lot of room for optimization.

753
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Correct. Yeah.

754
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
This means that this player can actually give up armor on some of their tempering or item affixes and look for other stats.

755
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Like that's kind of the point.

756
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So next, the stat caps. So you know now that we've introduced a lot of ways to get really high amounts of stats in the game, we want to kind of control for visual clarity.

757
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You know, what a player can put on to their screen.

758
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So kind of somewhere to some caps we have already in the game like a tax speed or elemental resistance.

759
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
We're putting some caps on cooldown reduction and the increased area size.

760
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You know like it's really fun to get those giant props known as that cover the screen.

761
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But when it goes like two or three skirmies away, it can get really noisy and messy.

762
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So we still want these stats to be really powerful and impactful.

763
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
But just control a little bit the amount of insanity that they can bring.

764
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And one thing on this cooldown reduction cap to be clear, this is not just CDR across the entire game.

765
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
This is just capping what you can get from gear.

766
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So this is like the base cooldown reduction you get when you first cast the skill what it's going to be.

767
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:44,000
You can still get cooldown resets or additional cooldown effects from things like the skill tree or legendary powers that just reduce the cooldown of your skills as you do certain mechanics.

768
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
This is just like the baseline cap that comes from your gear.

769
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I think when we looked at the capper area effect too, we tested it on frost nova and we're like pretty meticulous on what that cap should be.

770
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And it was still massive.

771
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
No, I see you.

772
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
But I'd say like a rake in a cap.

773
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
You're still going to get to insanity when it comes to what's on the screen.

774
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It's still going to be awesome.

775
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So you can see here this is just showing you what the tooltip looks like now.

776
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
So we're going to be showing you as a player what those caps are.

777
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So you know when you're evaluating your gear on your tooltips, what it is.

778
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And then same thing here you can see here like the dust a warrior effect size bonus it caps at 100%.

779
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Next balance updates.

780
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So again, like I mentioned before, we made a lot of balance changes based on feedback.

781
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Again, thank you for playing and giving us all that feedback.

782
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I'm going to go over some of the things.

783
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
One of the bigger categories of things was again, like I mentioned, those changes due to combat readability and balancing player power.

784
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
A few examples here of things that we're reducing are like the amount of dust doubles that can be on your screen.

785
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
And fractured winter glass.

786
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:49,000
One of my new favorite uniques we're bringing in the amount of frozen orbs that could span the screen is going to be reduced a bit.

787
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So I want to prepare you all for that.

788
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Again, to be clear, you're still going to spawn a whole lot.

789
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It's just not going to be like insane amounts where you can't see things anymore.

790
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
They're still going to be very powerful. I'm going to show a video a little later of kind of the difference of PTR to what's going to ship in the game.

791
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Some other things that we're doing fortify we wanted to increase the amount of damage reduction that you get.

792
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
This is just fortify across the board the base mechanic that DR is going from 10 to 15%.

793
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And this was because before when it was at 10%, we had to take into account that players get damage reduction from a million different sources throughout the game.

794
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Now that it's more and more premium, we can actually make this mechanic in the game a little bit more impactful and feel like you're a take your player for obvious into this.

795
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
These kinds of builds. We also made a lot of temporary naffix updates.

796
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm not going to go as a detail them, just know like what you saw on PTR and what's going to shape your gets to get a lot of improvements, a lot of balance changes, even some shuffling around of the affixes to make them ways that make more sense based on feedback.

797
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And then we did do some clash changes as well. I'm only going to give a very few examples here, but just know that there were quite a few.

798
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:58,000
One is jurid players. Companion jurid players always harass me. They want that build to work and I agree. It's really cool.

799
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So we increased the health of jurid wolves by 200% and we also reduced the respawn rate and cut it in half.

800
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So we got feedback basically that their companions were really good and fun and did damage, but in the late game they just kind of died and couldn't survive.

801
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So we're doing this to kind of address that feedback.

802
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Alright, so here's Dust Doubles as an example. You can see on the left, this is just one barbarian by themselves.

803
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
They came out of Dust Doubles and they could produce, right? And then on the right you can see kind of the same barbarian.

804
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You can see like the Dust Doubles around the areas where the enemies are. They're still getting hit by a ton of them, but it's not covering the entire screen, right?

805
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And especially when you get like three, four mini players together, it really becomes insanity.

806
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Yeah, it's when you're in a party of four barbs or...

807
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah, it's just like everyone's a barb and I don't know where I'm walking.

808
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yeah, in other classes, we can do that kind of thing too, not just a barb, but this is kind of a good example.

809
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
So you know, this has kind of seen the difference between PTR and live.

810
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And then next we have another class chain, so Scoundrel's Kiss.

811
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
This is another one of our new new Uniques that a row players give us a lot of feedback on.

812
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So a quick summary of how this unique works is it kind of changes your rapid fire skill from shooting straight and hitting a single enemy into kind of a mortar skill where you shoot up into the air and then your arrows fall on the ground and explode.

813
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:21,000
It's really, really cool, but one of the pieces of feedback we got was that when you launched the arrows, they would kind of go and align and they wouldn't all hit the same enemy anymore.

814
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So if you were trying to single target damage, it could actually be a nerf unless you like walked right up to the enemies and shot them.

815
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And while there was a way to play around it, you know, players weren't really happy though.

816
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Like we transformed the skill so much that I went from a range still skill to kind of a melee skill.

817
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So we made an update here and we have a video of them before and after.

818
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:47,000
But basically see how the PTR on the left here, how you know, it goes in a big line and then the player has to run right next to the target dummy to do the full damage to it.

819
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And on the right now, you'll see basically you target where those arrows are going to drop and they just all go to that area.

820
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So you can hit a single enemy, but you also hit all the enemies around it because the arrows explode.

821
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So she'd be a lot more usable compared to before.

822
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Can Skendler's kiss ricochet with my rapid fire?

823
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I'm pretty sure, yes, it can.

824
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So it does all the things and it harrows all the things that your rapid fire does.

825
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That's very cool.

826
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But it's pretty cool.

827
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Can a double projectile.

828
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm pretty sure it can.

829
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
There's like everything else.

830
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yes.

831
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Spam everywhere.

832
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Yes, he loves spam.

833
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And last but not least, a bug fixes.

834
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Like I mentioned before, there were a whole lot of bug fixes reported to us.

835
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Thank you all for getting them.

836
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
We address pretty much every single one that was reported.

837
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I'm giving some examples here, but again, we got a lot more than what I'm showing on the screen.

838
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
One was Druid's Hurricane was incorrectly scaling damage, basically infinitely.

839
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
So we fixed that.

840
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Evan Pierser, the extra missiles from our new unique.

841
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
They incorrectly had 100% lucky hit chance, which is procking a lot of crazy stuff.

842
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And then Flame Weaver.

843
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I don't know one of the new things we introduced to the game.

844
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:57,000
It's basically an effect where you can put a firewall on the ground and then you shoot fire bolts through it and you'll split the fire bolts.

845
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Really cool fantasy.

846
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
But what happened with in the PTR was you could stack a bunch of fireballs right on top of each other.

847
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And they would split the fire bolts multiplicatively and add more and more way more than intended.

848
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So you could fire a ridiculous number of fireballs which were crashing servers and things.

849
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
So it wasn't great.

850
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
But now we fixed that so it'll work properly.

851
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And again, you know, we're still discovering and working on other fixes.

852
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
There were a lot more that went in.

853
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
If you reported it, it was very likely fixed.

854
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So basically the build will be in a much better stable state once we watch.

855
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And that's really due to all your feedback.

856
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
So thanks again.

857
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Awesome.

858
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
That's my section.

859
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
A lot of changes coming to classes, class balance feedback, where you got from PTR was really, really great.

860
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Yeah.

861
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
We were able to make so many different changes there.

862
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Of course, some of the biggest ones like the readability stuff that we probably saw.

863
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I've seen the initial videos of like the dust doubles everywhere was, was, was, yeah.

864
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It's crazy.

865
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I was playing in a party with like, I was playing PTR and being in a party with like two, two barbs and like another like an echo master.

866
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I was like, Oh, okay.

867
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Everybody's going on the right to see it.

868
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Yeah.

869
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah.

870
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You know, PTR is, you know, one of the things you get to see things in development state.

871
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I will say these kinds of things are actually pretty common when we're developing anything is being able to create these crazy situations.

872
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And we, you know, we have the fix it for the game before it goes live.

873
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
So, you know, that's kind of the advantage of PTR's players can find these things.

874
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Yeah.

875
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Exactly.

876
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
So a lot more manpower being put in.

877
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah, PTR was super great for us to have.

878
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Yeah.

879
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Thanks again to the community for the feedback on all the class balance changes and thanks Adam for walking us through that.

880
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah.

881
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
The next thing we do want to talk about is with Derek over here.

882
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Derek is actually going to talk a little bit about, of course, all the immense helltie changes.

883
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Probably one of the most popular features and changes that we've introduced in season four with with PTR and people being able to experience it.

884
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Of course, we got feedback based off of players jumping into helltie and we do want to go through all that with Derek.

885
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And we also want to talk a little bit about the season itself with Derek.

886
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So, Derek, want to jump in?

887
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Yeah, just a few things to cover.

888
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Yeah.

889
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:14,000
So, as you mentioned, the players who joined us when the PTR were caught all the various like blog and video posts and whatnot know that with season four were introducing permanent upgrades to the helltie experience.

890
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Have you focused on improving and enhancing, I guess, monster density and activity variety?

891
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:29,000
There's a ton more things to do in the helltides and as a result, there's just a ton more monsters to, you know, know through in the helltides.

892
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:37,000
There's also some explorations and just to, you know, double back real quick, these are all permanent across both the seasonal and eternal realms.

893
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
So, they're not going away once season four ends.

894
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
This is just how it's part of the game.

895
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Yeah.

896
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Part of the game, kind of like our item updates too, right?

897
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Yeah. Now, this is the game world we live in.

898
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Yeah.

899
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
This is sanctuary.

900
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
But there's also, if you kind of look at the top rise screen, they're threat system.

901
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So, the longer you're fighting in the tides, you're going to be accumulating threat which just results in even more monsters ambushing you at higher frequencies than monster packs.

902
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I think the personal favorite and I think like fan favorite is the hellworm, you know, this giant demon slug bug that just pops out from the ground and just vomits monsters all over you.

903
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
You know, kind of with all those, the seasons as we say a lot are an amazing opportunity for experimentation.

904
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And sometimes the best results of those experimentations are when they can inspire permanent upgrades and just enhancements to the base game as a whole.

905
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:35,000
So, that's where the hellborne and the new accursed ritual and blood made and come into play as part of the new helltide experience.

906
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah, look at those.

907
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Those look great.

908
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So, the hellborne and our season two players might recall, we introduced the blood seekers.

909
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And those were really cool monsters based on class archetypes.

910
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
So, you're kind of like fighting the empiric shadow versions of yourself.

911
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And we take a look at that content, we just love it from like the team perspective and just find like, hey, we're upgrading the helltides.

912
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
This is a perfect piece of content to just include with it.

913
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So, that's where the hellborne came into play.

914
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
You know, they're fallen heroes of sanctuary.

915
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
They've been overtaken by the corruption from hell and kind of turned against you.

916
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Kind of in line with that, the accursed ritual and the blood made in.

917
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:24,000
In season two with the bloodlers and the blood seekers, we introduced this concept of, I guess calling it just like, open world social boss summoning.

918
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
We followed up with like the, yeah, there's a buzzer right there.

919
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Yeah, it's very, very, very casual.

920
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Yeah, I love it.

921
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Again, to my designer speak sometimes.

922
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But yeah.

923
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And we followed that up with like the mouth responders in season three.

924
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:47,000
And again, looking at these really successful experimentation from previous seasons, we love opportunities to bring players together and just add the extra outlayer to the helltide experience.

925
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So, that's where the accursed ritual comes into play.

926
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:55,000
So, as you're out fighting gets the tides, you'll be collecting the new material, the painful hearts that you can bring to the accursed ritual.

927
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It takes three to summon up the blood maiden and you can do this by yourself or you can partner up with some buddies and all, I guess, contribute to the summoning together.

928
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And the blood maiden itself is our new helltide miniboss that she's immensely powerful but also very, very lucrative.

929
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:20,000
And I think the last thing a little forgot to mention is that this is all expanding into World Tour's one and two as well.

930
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And kind of like a distilled not diluted.

931
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So, the helltide and World Tour one and two is more specifically tuned to, I guess, like meet the leveling needs, the needs of the leveling player.

932
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Awesome.

933
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Well, on the blood maiden, I remember you had talked about with me before that the people that summon the blood maiden actually get bonus of the loot drops, right?

934
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah, absolutely.

935
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
So, you can either contribute just by yourself to the blood maiden and get some extra loot for your troubles.

936
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Make sure that we give you a little bit extra because you're sacrificing up your hearts.

937
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But also, every player that doesn't stack so you're not stressed to say, hey, I just need to be the one that summons them all.

938
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:05,000
We can all party up and just deposit our own bainful hearts and I guess reap the benefits of that.

939
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yeah, right.

940
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
To be clear, so if you put in all three, you get bonus loot, right?

941
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Correct.

942
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
So, give me and Colin are in a group and like I put in two and you put in one, do I get more loot than you?

943
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
No, no.

944
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So, you get the same amount of loot.

945
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:25,000
So, you know, if Colin has a bainful heart to deposit and if we all dump them in together, then we all get the share benefits of that.

946
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Got it.

947
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:36,000
But I will touch on a bit later the PTR updates and just some of the enhanced value that the blood maiden received since PTR for both contributors and non-contributors to the summon.

948
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Awesome. Yeah, so a lot of new stuff coming in for a hell-tight, then this is all part of the stuff that players got to experience in the PTR.

949
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And of course, we got learnings from the PTR as you just mentioned.

950
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Many.

951
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Do you want to walk us through some of the changes that are coming in with hell-tight for all the PTR feedback that we had?

952
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Yeah, I think I have a PowerPoint on my own.

953
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Ooh, there you go.

954
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
You're gonna look at that.

955
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah, so as mentioned,

956
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000
some of sweeping changes going into the hell-tides and just overall balance of the game in general season four.

957
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And kind of with that, sometimes, you know, we push a little bit too far in some regard.

958
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So, we did get feedback and also just own internal kind of fill checks on the center drop rates.

959
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
We're filling a bit slow in the PTR.

960
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So, we just went back, reviewed it, and gathered our feedback and just iterated on the drop percentage to hit closer to the expectations of how much we want to be collecting the hell.

961
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
The senders and interacting with the tortured gifts.

962
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
So, I think we're in a much better spot right now actually.

963
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
So, that was one of the first major pieces coming out from the PTR.

964
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
A lot more chess from this, yeah.

965
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Yeah, chess, more loot, more fun.

966
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Awesome.

967
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Let's see the next one.

968
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Yeah, so on the topic of more is more fun, the Bainful Hearts.

969
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
We were noticing that they were dropping a bit inconsistently.

970
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So, you can get the Bainful Hearts from opening tortured gifts, killing the hellborne, and one of the Doomseer variants, one of our new activity types.

971
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But, again, we want to get the Bainful Hearts in the hands of the players with the pretty, you know, steady cadence.

972
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
So, we noticed with the PTR that we're just not gaining them as frequently as we wanted to.

973
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:25,000
So, we just went back, iterated, and kind of reviewed our bad luck protection to just ensure that we improved the consistency that Bainful Hearts are dropping.

974
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And this is all kind of like, the Bloodmade is not meant to be seen as like this highly ambitious piece of content that you'll engage with like once every 50 levels.

975
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,000
We want you to get in the hearts, we want you engaging with the social boss summoning mechanic.

976
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
And, you know, I think it just adds that extra layer to the health as we want you to engage with.

977
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And, on the topic of the Bloodmade in, overall like we touched on earlier, the Bloodmade into just seeing some overall rewards improvements.

978
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So, as noticed, or as mentioned before, if you contribute to the summon of the Bloodmade in, you receive a bonus reward.

979
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
But, one of the things was that you couldn't really tell.

980
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
There is a little icon that appears like where your buff bar, but the effects about was largely unnoticed.

981
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
From both the team and actually know just the PTR players themselves.

982
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So, again, taking this opportunity to just review the overall value of the Bloodmade for contributors and non-contributors alike.

983
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Because again, we wanted to make sure that she has a clear role in the health had experience.

984
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
So, again, overall, Bloodmade is just overall more valuable.

985
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:44,000
For this, we're dropping things like legendaries for Gauten's Soul, Lorsair Mats, and a percent chance for contributors at the end-world tiers to get some end-game boss materials as well.

986
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Yeah, so this is now an additional opportunity for players to get additional of the boss mats for the boss ladders.

987
01:12:51,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Which, you know, we've heard a lot of how players were like, hey, we only really have one kind of method to get them and we wanted to expand that and bring that into more avenues.

988
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Players didn't have to just kind of be like tunneled off into one area to get specific boss mats, which is cool.

989
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Yeah, for ideas of the spice of life.

990
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Yes.

991
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I like that the contribution encourages these actually use these.

992
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:19,000
And see, I just chain some of the boss over and over and over and there would be this awkward dance where someone would shove and it's like, I know you have.

993
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah, that's why it's really also important that the nuance is honestly lost pretty frequently when we're talking about drops from different kinds of creatures and different types of stuff.

994
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Like, treasure gobbling. We talked about treasure gobbling a while ago a few seasons ago and I remember I put a poll out on x.com.

995
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:50,000
So, at one point, I put a poll basically asking players what they believed the legendary drop rate of treasure gobbling to be and I had a whole bunch of options in there.

996
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I think like 85% of the players were wrong.

997
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Because the drop rate at that time was 50%. Players didn't feel it because they didn't see the treasure gobbling enough to really notice that it was actually that high.

998
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:08,000
So, I think making sure that we were like buffing up those moments where like if I had my contribution bonus and higher that helps make sure that is felt.

999
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1000
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:16,000
You know what's funny is Joe talking off screen and we're all looking off and people are just staring us stare into this random corner.

1001
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You know what would be funny is to be all of those.

1002
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
We're all just back there at a bail.

1003
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Every time. Every time.

1004
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
And like Joe's turning into bail.

1005
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Oh, really coming in.

1006
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Oh, that's awkward.

1007
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I like the deep shadows that's where it is.

1008
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I guess the moment when I decide to say something maybe the old occasion.

1009
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Oh, we have another camera.

1010
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Awesome.

1011
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Cool.

1012
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So, a lot of health changes that we have coming into.

1013
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Yeah, I think there's actually one more slide.

1014
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:51,000
So, one thing that we've kind of covered a lot across like just tempering and just the master working.

1015
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Just a spirit of season four in general.

1016
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Just like removing friction points and just keeping players in the flow of fun.

1017
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
People want to blast.

1018
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1019
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
So, one of the doomsayer variants.

1020
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And again, like the doomsayer's new activity type is kind of a kind of a kind of a surprise where you interact with them.

1021
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
They crackle and pop into something of a variety of things actually.

1022
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,000
So, one of the variants that we had was the chest of doomsaying where they would explode into a tortured gift that costs 50%.

1023
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
And gives you a whole lot of good stuff.

1024
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
We're kind of reviewing that.

1025
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
And sometimes what could happen is you can encounter one of these at the very start of your health tide run.

1026
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
You don't have 50 centers.

1027
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
It's not a lot to get, but it still is kind of a stressful potentially fills bad moment.

1028
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
So, we just said, hey, let's just have it explode into the loot directly.

1029
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You say 50 centers and you kind of just keep going on your merry way in the tides.

1030
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So, that's one of the kind of like efficiency smoothing out that we've done.

1031
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
The next one is also just, we're dumping a whole bunch of monsters on you.

1032
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And it's always a filled bad moment when you get knocked out of interaction.

1033
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You're trying just to open up the tortured gift and you know, head out.

1034
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
So, we reduced the channel time to open tortured gifts from three seconds to 1.5 seconds.

1035
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I believe for season four launch proper.

1036
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Thanks.

1037
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
That'll help a lot.

1038
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So, and I think while I just some feedback are like, you know, why don't we just make it instant, right?

1039
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Right. Right. Right. Yeah, you know, we kind of do want a safeguard against like the accidental clicks.

1040
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Again, it's a frenetic game. So, you're clicking a whole bunch and, you know, I think 1.5 seconds is enough time to, you know, let you make sure that that's what you want to commit to before you open it.

1041
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And there's also like, because you guys can talk about this, there's changes to like the channeling.

1042
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Like you, I think with like dot damage and stuff like that.

1043
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Yeah, yeah, dot damage now will interrupt channeling as well.

1044
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Yeah. Which is pretty nice.

1045
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Which is good. So, especially as you are in the frantic areas of hell tide and everything.

1046
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So, yeah, lots of hell tide changes, a lot of good feedback from players from PTR.

1047
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Derek, thanks for walking through on that.

1048
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
But you're not done yet. But we do want to do more.

1049
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Yeah, but wait a minute.

1050
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:56,000
As you guys know, like there is this is season four, we're born and part of hell tide includes the iron walls.

1051
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And some people have figured that out even before our blog on Tuesday.

1052
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:07,000
But we did want to talk a little bit about season four and iron walls participation in that,

1053
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:14,000
along with some cool things that are specific to seasonal characters for season four as well.

1054
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Yeah, yeah. So again, as mentioned, the players who joined us in the PTR or again caught all the various blog posts will notice that the iron wolves are now a permanent part of the hell tides.

1055
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
You know, they're fighting and dying alongside the players now and they're here to stay.

1056
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
However, for our seasonal players, we have the call of the wolf seasonal activity,

1057
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:51,000
where players will get to spend a bit more time with the iron wolves and go on a bit of a journey with them to try and uncover the potential root cause behind these rising tides and uncover this mysterious phenomenon that's threatening to corrupt and consume the iron wolves from within.

1058
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
But in addition to that, you know, again, the iron wolves are in the hell tides with you.

1059
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:04,000
As players are fighting and dying alongside the iron wolves and the hell tides, you're also going to be earning your way through the wolves honor reputation system.

1060
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:19,000
And this is saying you progress your way through a collection of just super juiced rewards that are specifically turned to overpower your leveling journey from level one to 100 and beyond.

1061
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:39,000
The main pillar for this reputation track was really pushing the players powers forward, the player power for the players power forward and giving them early access to, you know, gear with the juice stats, legendaries, materials, boss materials and even a resplendent spark to as like a cherry on top at the end.

1062
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
We love the juice.

1063
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
We do, you do love that.

1064
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:53,000
But, you know, in the spirit of weight, there's more, you know, those are all like the gameplay related things, but we also have a couple really cool cosmetics that you earn through the collective call the wolf season activity.

1065
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So this is the iron wolf mount trophy, the little iron wolf banner and oh, a little bit fast, but yeah, so the iron wolf mount trophy, we're doing a lifer.

1066
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,000
That's earned from completing the rep, there it is.

1067
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
You can get both of them.

1068
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:16,000
That's earned through completing the reputation track and the blood made in head is earned by completing the associated iron, the call the wolf quest line.

1069
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Awesome. Yeah, those look really great. And of course, as you mentioned, resplendent sparks.

1070
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:31,000
And then I know there's one other item that I know we wanted to talk about with this season specific because it is specific for season four and yeah, yeah, yeah.

1071
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Thanks for the reminder of that. There's so much to cover.

1072
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:43,000
There's a lot. Derek has like the largest list of items to kind of go through here. So, yeah, so you know, as mentioned before, on the seasonal team, we love our experiments.

1073
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And I don't think a season will be one without some of the little experiments. So with that, we have the seasonal item, whereas kind of like call it the seasonal toy.

1074
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And that's the profane mine cage.

1075
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Yep, so there it is. So the profane mine cage is pretty cool in the sense that it's a guaranteed drop from the hellborn.

1076
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And when you consume it, I kind of like to imagine you just like eating this demon brain.

1077
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Yeah.

1078
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:15,000
When you consume it, for the next 60 minutes, the haltyd monsters are going to be boosted up to 10 levels, depending on the world tour that you consume it in.

1079
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And you're also going to be increasing their aberrant, sender dropper rates. So, you know, again, all tying this back to that leveling journey and like tempering and stuff.

1080
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Like this is a really fun item that lets you kind of put your build to a little bit more of a test in exchange for maximizing your haltyd efficiencies through, you know, just one higher months level means more XP and some like that.

1081
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
And also just aberrant sender drops too.

1082
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

1083
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Oh, go ahead.

1084
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
I was going to say we'd use the world tour to three and four XP.

1085
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
So that's super well.

1086
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
So you can just get to Blasta and get very quickly now.

1087
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Yeah. And with the my page itself, like, you know, because everyone's probably going like, well, that's a consumable, like how do how do people end up like obtaining additional ones of those or can get more of those throughout the season and everything?

1088
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Yeah, we want to be very generous with those.

1089
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
So one, they're a guaranteed drop from the hellborn in world tours three and four.

1090
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
But you can also use them in world tours one and two.

1091
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So if you want to like boost some level, you know, all in what not.

1092
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
And you can also get a, I think like a bucket of them through the Wolves honor reputation.

1093
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Like we crammed as many rewards as we could in there.

1094
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
So they will be in steady stream.

1095
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
So don't again in the spirit of like use it.

1096
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Don't hoard it.

1097
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Definitely experiment and have fun with this thing because you know, it's a game. Have fun.

1098
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Yeah. So it's great.

1099
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Like if you want a little bit more of a challenge, a little bit better rewards as well.

1100
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
You can of course use your your mind cage.

1101
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
And that is exclusive for players in the season.

1102
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yeah, it's awesome to see.

1103
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But yeah, thank you, Derek, for walking through all the changes with Helltide.

1104
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Of course, it's some of the new season stuff with the Ironwolves.

1105
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And if you're a lore nerd, Ironwolves of course are very familiar faction within Diablo.

1106
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
They are from Diablo 2, act three.

1107
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
You could actually hire them as some of your mercenaries there.

1108
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:09,000
One of the mercenary options though we know a lot of people on with an act two mercenary in Diablo 2 for the aura.

1109
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But yes, cool.

1110
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Thank you so much.

1111
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Derek, of course we still have more to talk about.

1112
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
We're actually going to go back to Colin.

1113
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And Colin is going to talk us through a little bit about the pit.

1114
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
The pit is a brand new feature within season four.

1115
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
And it's out a permanent feature within Diablo 4.

1116
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:35,000
And yeah, do you want to like give us a breakdown from people who may have not experienced the pit or may have not seen the stream beforehand.

1117
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And then on top of that, tell us about all the improvements that we're doing to the pit based off of people.

1118
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Yeah, so you know something that players have asked for since we did a bunch of nerfs to the nightmare dungeons.

1119
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
If you recall, I forgot what season it was, but we made tier 100 nightmare dungeons a lot easier.

1120
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
So players can get through them.

1121
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
One of the big pieces of feedback we got was, okay, well where's my measuring stick?

1122
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
You know, the game is a power fantasy. It's about getting as much raw power as possible and just dominating.

1123
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So if there's no place to push back, then everything is just a little bit too easy.

1124
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
So the pit of the artificer is our answer to that measuring stick.

1125
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
You're going to be able to push very deep into the pit.

1126
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
There's a lot of levels. We were inspired by Abitware of Zero.

1127
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:23,000
But to be very clear, you know, Abitware of Zero was a special case and that each tier jump was just like brutal.

1128
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It was like ridiculously hard.

1129
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Every single tier and it's like, you can only get to 7, which isn't very heroic or powerful.

1130
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
So we've taken a lot of the learnings from Abitware of Zero.

1131
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
The pit goes very deep. There's many more tiers.

1132
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,000
It's much more gradual. So you can start pushing into it and getting some of these master working material rewards.

1133
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And the pit is all about, you know, just blasting through monsters and the demons of hell, right?

1134
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
There's no negative modifiers. We're not CCing you a bunch.

1135
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
You know, this is really just a test of how powerful your build is.

1136
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So from the PTR, we actually got feedback that it was way too easy because we added a ton of power through tempering,

1137
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
through the codecs of powers, just much easier to get a lot of those aspects online.

1138
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So we've taken a look and we've moved some of the master working material tiers around previously.

1139
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
You know, the tier one master working materials only came from 1 to 20.

1140
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
We've moved that up 10 tiers. So tier one will come from 1 to 29.

1141
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Tier two will come from 30 to 59 and tier three will be 60 plus.

1142
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And what that does, it just makes the journey feel a little bit more rewarding, right?

1143
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Like we saw in the PTR that people just like within the first two hours just blasted through all of it because they're so powerful.

1144
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
So we've just adjusted some of the rates there.

1145
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
So you have to push a little bit deeper. You have to optimize your build a little bit more.

1146
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
So those armor caps are things to watch out for, right?

1147
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,000
If you're over the armor cap, it's just a straight optimization to start thinking about how you want to replace them in the armor.

1148
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
And we think that feels pretty good.

1149
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:01,000
And overall, we've increased the health and damage, or sorry, I should say increased the health on all monsters post level 100 both in the pit and nightmare dungeons.

1150
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So the enemy should be pushing back on you a little bit more, right?

1151
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
You care a little bit more about utility, defense outside of just one shot and everything, right?

1152
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
So it sort of tests you a lot more.

1153
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And part of that feedback though that we've heard is that well, nightmare dungeons don't feel very rewarding.

1154
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:25,000
The pit doesn't feel super rewarding post, you know, that 62 when you're getting those master working top end master working materials.

1155
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
So we've done two major changes.

1156
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
One is we've added obols that scale with both of these tiers.

1157
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
So everything passed tier 46 nightmare dungeons and everything passed tier one.

1158
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
And the pit actually, it always gives you obols.

1159
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
You might ask like, but obols are terrible.

1160
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
But again, I want obols, call it.

1161
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I know, right. A big part of season four was that we made the gambler guarantee 925 legendaries at level 100.

1162
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And those legendaries can roll greater apics.

1163
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So if you blow a ton of obols on two handers, for example, those two handed legendaries are getting are the same as anywhere else in the game.

1164
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
So it's actually a huge efficiency boost to getting items you're looking for.

1165
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So you can get like some of the best items.

1166
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
You can get the obel that are now absolutely.

1167
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,000
And one thing that is also changing with obols is like, because you know, when people pick up obols, they're like,

1168
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
I've got my cap.

1169
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And now I'm like, oh my god, I'm back down.

1170
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
But call in the obelcap is fun.

1171
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
So, you know, like, we've increased the obelcap substantially.

1172
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
So the amount of obols you get now is 2500.

1173
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You can hold that.

1174
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
So you can just like, go to the gambler and give me everything.

1175
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And you can just do that a couple of times.

1176
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
So get your obels and hit the tables for your game.

1177
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Yeah, exactly.

1178
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And the items are incredible.

1179
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And just to like, double down this for a second too, like the, like, one of the things that we also did as part of this, like when you're,

1180
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,000
when you use the enchanting feature in Diablo IV, you can't actually enchant off of an apics into a greater apics.

1181
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:59,000
So when a good item drops for you in the base game, you can't, you can't try to like, roll for greater apics who's off the enchanting system.

1182
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
It's good for getting you to a stat you really need in a situation where an item didn't get you what you wanted.

1183
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:10,000
But now with the obel's vendor, like those items, not only are they IPAR 925 and they have the chance to be legendary, of course, like the obel's vendor always has.

1184
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
But you also have a chance to get greater apics who's off those game.

1185
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Yeah.

1186
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:23,000
So if you are again, if you're looking for a particular pair of gloves, you're looking for a particular helmet, and you're really, you're saying I really want a greater apics version of cool down reduction on my helmet.

1187
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Right.

1188
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Now it's like, okay, cool, I'm going to take my 2000 obel's, I'm going to go to the, I'm going to go to the vendor, I'm just going to just gamble gamble gamble and try to get the try to get that one helmet.

1189
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Like now I have a chance to really do that. And this is a way for you to like getting more drops and such inside the pit is one thing, but giving you more choice when you get out of a pit run, I think you're very, very valuable.

1190
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1191
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Yeah, and another change we made was to glyph XB. We got a bunch of feedbacks. It's like, yeah, what the hell, nightmare dungeon. So we've increased the glyph XB by 25%, which is faster and leveling.

1192
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And we've also scaled the amount of rune shards, which is the pit currency to get into the pit with nightmare dungeon.

1193
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:16,000
So you can create sort of a positive feedback loop if you're really strong and you're really powerful, you're hitting those tier 100s and the nightmare dungeons are getting tons of pit keys that you can then translate into the pit and just get lots of runs and lots of mass working there.

1194
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Yeah, so a lot of feedback from nightmare dungeons, people were saying like, hey, are we planning on making any changes to that glyph XB?

1195
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Yeah, so there are sure that we actioned on it.

1196
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Sure. And there's funny enough, there's also even in the season journey, I believe there's also like changes to that, the hashes themselves where you can actually use that to boost even like glyph XB is also part of that with the season journey.

1197
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
So, very cool. So, we have one more. Sorry.

1198
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I have this list, but then I don't actually.

1199
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
But then she's like a pro.

1200
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:04,000
One other thing that we did was we heard a bunch of feedback that players were dying at the end of the pit because we have this like shadow boss that sometimes comes in and throws a wrench in what you're doing.

1201
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And you know, as much as I push for learn to play, you know, our encounter design is absolutely.

1202
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Take this for players.

1203
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Surprise.

1204
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Yeah, isn't it fun to die after you killed the boss?

1205
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Yeah, so our encounter designer did an amazing job.

1206
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And I think a lot of those affixes after you killed that boss and the arena should be clear now.

1207
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
As Chats says, get good.

1208
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:38,000
But yeah, we saw that a lot and if you're a hardcore player that would have been a tragic lost character.

1209
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I prefer the world of hilarious.

1210
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah, some designers like this pumping like you.

1211
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Yeah, just watching streams and reactions from that.

1212
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,000
So a lot of changes coming for the pit is of course a new feature within Diablo 4 permanently.

1213
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And you can experience that in eternal and seasonal realms.

1214
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And of course, we have some updates to the boss ladder because the boss ladder itself is changing pretty, pretty significantly.

1215
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
We talked a little bit about like how you can get additional materials and other places that Derek had mentioned.

1216
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:18,000
But Colin has additional points that he wants to bring up about the boss ladder because we got a lot of feedback on that.

1217
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
And there's some new changes to it in season four.

1218
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Yeah, so we added Endario the best lesser evil.

1219
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Yes.

1220
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Boo asma Derek.

1221
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Yeah, he's dunking me.

1222
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That's dunks me with a warped old day who likes that guy.

1223
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
So Endario obviously has come back.

1224
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
She's incredibly fun to fight.

1225
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
They counter design team killed it.

1226
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And you know, on top of Endario, we've added a new tier to the boss ladder called tormented bosses.

1227
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
So these are much higher level level 200 bosses.

1228
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Sort of pinnacle aspirational bosses to take down.

1229
01:30:51,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And what we've done here is we heard a bunch of feedback that it required five times the amount of boss materials, including some rare pit material to summon these.

1230
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And five times the reward.

1231
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
That didn't really feel like the right amount of reward efficiency for taking on something that was challenging.

1232
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
So we've nerfed the cost.

1233
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
It's now three X the amount of boss material and five X the rewards.

1234
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
You get some pretty big efficiency wins there, especially if you're crushing them and then game.

1235
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
So that's feeling pretty good.

1236
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:27,000
We think we also heard a lot of feedback that it's tedious to do the same activity over and over and over to summon some of these things.

1237
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
So it's like I want to summon pendant at night or I want to do the beast and ice.

1238
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I know you and I have done that one.

1239
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Yeah, 100 dill at chosen in the season requires the beast and ice.

1240
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
And it's like I guess I'm stuck in the number of dungeon.

1241
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I'm not going to tell her or it's great.

1242
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

1243
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
So yeah, well, we made it better.

1244
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
A lot of our random monsters and activities and things like that.

1245
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,000
So elites, whisper caches, treasure goblins, world bosses, hell born to name a few.

1246
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
We're all going to start randomly dropping these boss materials.

1247
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
So you know, you're not necessarily forced into doing one exact activity.

1248
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
It's still going to be the absolute best way to get some of this boss material.

1249
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:08,000
But as long as you're blasting, you're just going to be getting a lot of these materials ambiently, which you can trade.

1250
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
You can just sort of cash in on your heart's desire.

1251
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,000
And we think this makes the game feel more flexible and sort of enables you to play a little bit more on how you want to play.

1252
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I'll still keep the experience fresh.

1253
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
So we think that's going to be a pretty big win.

1254
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Yeah, huge.

1255
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Yeah.

1256
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
To jump back into the torment bosses, I just, because I'm going to jump around a little bit.

1257
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
We heard a bunch of feedback, especially from Medijo.

1258
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Hopefully he's watching is there's a lot of way we're just watching around.

1259
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I know, probably not.

1260
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
It's not very interesting.

1261
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
We did some tuning to make sure that the torment and versions have some more parody, right?

1262
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
It was sort of like an, in a scenario where like one of the latter bosses was just like dead easy.

1263
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Didn't really match the difficulty of the rest.

1264
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:54,000
And that's important because we give you one guaranteed respondent spark one time for defeating any of these.

1265
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,000
So one step closer to getting that Uber unique that's not just a rod drop of your choice, which is pretty awesome.

1266
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And then something else, you know, speaking of respondent sparks, we're adding one to Uber Lilith.

1267
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,000
So the first time you kill Uber Lilith, you're also going to get another respondent spark.

1268
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:17,000
So now that brings us to three opportunities of being able to earn yourself a respondent spark.

1269
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:26,000
That's where you heard one from Derek at the end of the season, the Iron Moles board, and doing that within the season.

1270
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:32,000
We now have one with the echo of Lilith, and of course one with your first tormented boss as well.

1271
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
So additional opportunities to earn respondent spark.

1272
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And of course you can still salvage your any Uber gear that you do happen to find.

1273
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
And you can actually earn a respondent spark.

1274
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
So what I mean is if you do all these and then you get an Uber unique, you can actually change that into whatever one you want.

1275
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Yes.

1276
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Yeah. This is where the Lilith that means.

1277
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:58,000
And then something else, you know, on the Uber Uniques is the, I'm just laughing because I didn't realize this, but chat's calling out.

1278
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Our tool tip that we showed, we had 200 plus respondent spark.

1279
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Yeah. That's what happens when you're working.

1280
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
We're just really happy.

1281
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Yeah.

1282
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Yeah.

1283
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
That's how I get them.

1284
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Let me tell you guys, you get them tools.

1285
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Yeah.

1286
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Yeah.

1287
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Okay. That's actually my account online.

1288
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Oh yeah.

1289
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Nice.

1290
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:26,000
So on the Uber Uniques, you know, we heard a bunch of feedback that it feels like a chore to have to do, you know,

1291
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
the penitent and I into Varshawn into doing Durel just for a chance at an Uber Unique, right?

1292
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
And, you know, we've experienced that ourselves, right?

1293
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
It's like, God, I gotta do all this stuff to fight the boss that's gonna actually drop something that I care about.

1294
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
You know, greater affix is help that because, you know, there's some variation to the Uniques you're gonna get.

1295
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:50,000
But for Uber Uniques, we've actually added a small chance, a little bit lower than Durel to all of the ladder bosses.

1296
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And they're gonna have a chance to drop an Uber Unique as well.

1297
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,000
So, you know, while you're grinding through this ladder, every single boss you kill is gonna have a chance to drop an Uber Unique.

1298
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
It's not exactly the same as Durel, Durel and Durel.

1299
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
We should do like a combo or a Durel or a lot of rails.

1300
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And we think that's gonna make it feel a lot better.

1301
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Awesome.

1302
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:16,000
So yeah, a lot of changes coming with the boss ladder and changes based off of PTR feedback that we saw.

1303
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Well, that's just overall changes for season four that we were planning.

1304
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
So that it gives more opportunities for players to actually experience it.

1305
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Of course, the new versions of the bosses and sells and are more than that co-version.

1306
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
So, awesome.

1307
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Thank you so much, Colin.

1308
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Of course.

1309
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And I know we wanted to, before we jump into Q&A because we were getting towards the end of our updates for season four,

1310
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Mr. Adam Jackson wants to talk a little bit about the season journey.

1311
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
This is actually something really cool.

1312
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
One last thing.

1313
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
It's over on Class Designer.

1314
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
We're really passionate about this and we're excited for it.

1315
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
So the season journey.

1316
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So we really want to kind of use the rewards and make the season journey more exciting.

1317
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
And so what we went and did was when you're going through the season journey for every class,

1318
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:04,000
you're actually going to be getting a preset curated amount of legendaries as you're going through

1319
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
that are targeted toward a specific build.

1320
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So we chose a build for every class in season four and we're gonna change it around in future seasons.

1321
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Please give us feedback on this but we think it'll be pretty cool.

1322
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
But you're basically going to get like close to a completed build when it comes to opening those caches.

1323
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,000
They're guaranteed targeted legendaries to build a specific fantasy for every class.

1324
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I think we have a video to show what they're going to be for every class in season four.

1325
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Maybe there.

1326
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Maybe there.

1327
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,000
So Barbarian here, you can see we're gonna be giving you a bunch of legendaries related to dust doubles.

1328
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
The Druid, we're gonna be giving you basically a pulverized build, which is pretty cool.

1329
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Next is the Necromancer.

1330
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Of course, everybody's gonna be playing minions.

1331
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
So we gave you a bunch of minion focused legendaries.

1332
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
It should be pretty awesome.

1333
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
And then next is the Sorceress.

1334
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,000
We actually have a cool new legendary coming into the game for incinerate, which you'll see here.

1335
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
It's very tough.

1336
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
So we were giving you an incinerate build on the Sorceress.

1337
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And then the Rogue, we're giving you one target toward Barrage.

1338
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,000
So again, kind of the point of this is that if you don't really know what you want to play,

1339
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
or you really want to just go through a season journey and try out something before you go to a build that you really want to do,

1340
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,000
you have a foundation of something more complete to start with, which we're pretty excited about.

1341
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Yeah, and with the Codex change now, you also get to kill all those items that are actually dropping out of the season journey caches.

1342
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
You get to keep those.

1343
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
They're all going to your codex.

1344
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
You can use that build to the entire year leveling process.

1345
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Correct.

1346
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Yeah.

1347
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Awesome.

1348
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
So lots of changes coming in season.

1349
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Sorry, my mic died half way through there.

1350
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
So I did do a quick mic swap as we were playing it.

1351
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
We were free, too.

1352
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Also Joe Pyfors back.

1353
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Hi, Joe.

1354
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Derek is now over here.

1355
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
So if people are confused of like what's going on, we are playing musical chairs.

1356
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And that is also a new feature.

1357
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Our favorite season for it.

1358
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I'm just kidding.

1359
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
But yeah, so a lot of changes season for.

1360
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Previewage is by far the biggest season for Diablo IV yet.

1361
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And I know we wanted to jump into Q&A.

1362
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I do want to bring up one thing as well.

1363
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Oh, wow.

1364
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Which is this is a change that will be represented.

1365
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
And by the way, patch notes are coming out immediately after this stream.

1366
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
So.

1367
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Oh, geez.

1368
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Okay.

1369
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
So that's one thing.

1370
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
So yeah, people can check out patch notes immediately after this stream.

1371
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Please enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed writing it.

1372
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Previewing it.

1373
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Previewing it.

1374
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Previewing it.

1375
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Previewing it.

1376
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:30,000
And I wouldn't, based off of the size of the patch notes, I wouldn't be surprised if we do have a few things that might be missing.

1377
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:39,000
That would probably like have to post ad if as we're kind of going through it just because it's massive in terms of size as people saw from PTR.

1378
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And now it's just even.

1379
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
There were a lot of different teams.

1380
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I'll like effort trying to do this to you.

1381
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Yeah, so.

1382
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
But patch notes will be up.

1383
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:56,000
One thing in the patch notes that I did want to bring up is, and this is a thing that's coming in season four is for players that want to change their their hair on their characters themselves.

1384
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
They can actually go to the wardrobe now and actually be able to do it, which is a nice, like, good quality of life feature.

1385
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:07,000
We've heard a lot of people go like, hey, I kind of want to, you know, I made that character a while ago, especially like an internal character or something like that.

1386
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I would like to be able to change that around.

1387
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Yeah, now that flexibility being able to do so, which is actually really cool.

1388
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
So.

1389
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
We're going to jump into Q and A as usual as we always do.

1390
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Yeah.

1391
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
We will start off with a question.

1392
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
This is actually something that's been a popular topic that a lot of people have been talking about since PTR.

1393
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And of course, even this week with the blog itself, but.

1394
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Don't we mean suspense?

1395
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I know.

1396
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
I think there's the question.

1397
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
There it is.

1398
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
What does this mean for season powers in the future?

1399
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Oh, just what season four is?

1400
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Like the nature of season four?

1401
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Yeah, okay.

1402
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Sure.

1403
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:50,000
So, yeah, season four is a season four, as I mentioned before, is like an opportunity for us to kind of like lift up a lot of aspects of the game that we think are really important.

1404
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Diablo is a game about killing monsters and getting loot.

1405
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,000
And as I said before, getting loot, we need to make sure it feels at least as good as killing monsters.

1406
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Right?

1407
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
It's extremely important that this part feels good.

1408
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And we took a lot of our development effort and put it against that goal as part of this release.

1409
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
And there were other parts to gain what we lifted up at the same time.

1410
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Like the various changes that we talked about for Helltide, for example, you know, the Meary New Tempering recipes and things like that.

1411
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:19,000
There's lots of things we did, I think as part of the release, just make the base experience of Diablo four more fun.

1412
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Right?

1413
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
So, I'm really excited to be able to do that in season four.

1414
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Thinking about what the future holds, we always want to make sure that with every season, you know, we are adapting to what we think the game needs at that time.

1415
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
We think it's going to make for a better experience overall.

1416
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
We love the idea of seasonal powers.

1417
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:41,000
We've learned a lot of really, really great stuff from the days of the barber, all the way through the vampire powers we got in season two,

1418
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
and all the sentatial and constant stuff we had in season three.

1419
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:51,000
We have lots of big ideas for the future, so you will see seasonal powers again in future in different themes and mechanics as we go.

1420
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
That's kind of our promise to you.

1421
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And with the things we have in terms of the Iron Wolf's quest line and the various rewards you get,

1422
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:05,000
change to the seed and journey for getting all of those themed items, those various aspect builds together as you kind of progress through.

1423
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:11,000
We want to keep building up on these mechanical elements as well at the same time, to help lift up the experience.

1424
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
So yeah, we will be returning to seasonal powers in the future.

1425
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:21,000
But with every season, we want to make sure that we're doing what we think is uplifting the game up the most, the things that we think are most important at that time.

1426
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Awesome.

1427
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:30,000
A question from our... I'll bounce between some questions from chat and from our forums, because we did have a thread up in our forums about specific questions.

1428
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
This one's from the forums, this is from Abelon.

1429
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:44,000
They're asking if, because season three actually ran longer and season four itself had a PTR, will season four actually be a shortened season or will it still be a standard size season?

1430
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
They weren't sure how PTR is actually affecting the time on it.

1431
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
So PTR is not as impactful from the timing here.

1432
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I think it's a slightly shorter season. I think it's like one week shorter or something.

1433
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I think it's a look at the date.

1434
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Yeah, and I will note, the reason why season three ran longer was because we wanted to make sure that we could get that PTR.

1435
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:13,000
This was our first PTR, so there's a little bit more effort needed to get that out for pull-ups.

1436
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I guess you're absolutely right.

1437
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:20,000
So when I think about the future and what PTR is look like, we want things to be...

1438
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
It's not that having a PTR automatically means that everything is going to take longer to deliver.

1439
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
But there's a lot of things we had to set up at the first time for the PTR for season four.

1440
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I'm really glad that we did, because as I think you've seen, there's a lot of things we learned going through the process.

1441
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Give us a time to iterate and use the feedback to which we did a lot of things on.

1442
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Question from Blake Darko's CS.

1443
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Will you guys think about maybe a potential different being color for items with greater affixes?

1444
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
So I don't be talked about this for a while.

1445
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Yeah, I think that's something we're definitely going to keep an eye on.

1446
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Right now we think that the little dots, I should say huge dots, the huge stars on them, are doing a pretty good job.

1447
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:05,000
But that's something that we also need to feel out and play and we're super open to feedback and seeing how these new big stars are going to help.

1448
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Yeah.

1449
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Especially the changes in the inventory, because now you can actually identify them in your inventory and everything is really big.

1450
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
We also roll on unique, so there's a little bit of work that we'll need to figure out.

1451
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Yeah, it's true.

1452
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Yeah, you can get greater affix on your new colors as well.

1453
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Yeah, so the beam color gets a little confusing there.

1454
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:32,000
So something that we've seen from players and a lot of people bringing that specifically up.

1455
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Fire Dragon Dad says, this season four update is going to retro into existing eternal.

1456
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So, see, everything we talked about today with the exception of the Iron Wolf's quest line stuff, it isn't actually present in the eternal realm.

1457
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
So, players like the Codex Power Changes, everything like that will be there.

1458
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I know there are a lot of questions related to the Codex Changes, especially for eternal players.

1459
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:59,000
And just to clarify, if you have aspects in your inventory and your stash, it'll take whatever your highest roll of that specific aspect.

1460
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:08,000
And that will become your new best Codex entry when season four does start.

1461
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:14,000
You may need to log on to specific characters on the eternal to at least, like, for us to be able to check your inventory.

1462
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
But the stash, I know, will automatically move over there.

1463
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,000
And same thing for, I know we get a lot of questions about items on the eternal.

1464
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Those will be marked as like legacy items specifically, because obviously we've changed a lot about that.

1465
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And those items, you can't craft on those items either at this point.

1466
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
You can't temper those items, you can't masterwork those items.

1467
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
But they'll still retain like the item upgrade state that they have in the Blacksmith.

1468
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Exactly.

1469
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:45,000
So, if it doesn't mean like when you log on all your gear is suddenly unusable, it's just marked as legacy and you won't be able to use tempering on that.

1470
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:51,000
It's a great stepping off point to getting some new items that could have greater affixes and other things that could be making it even more powerful.

1471
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
A question that we have actually from the forums, this is from Iggy.

1472
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:06,000
With the itemization rework, is there what is like the next like big thing you guys are actually looking at potentially wanting to really work on within the team?

1473
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I don't know if we want to play our cards too early on.

1474
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Yeah.

1475
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I think it's working on things.

1476
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
We're working on all kinds of stuff, everybody.

1477
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:33,000
But no, I think one thing we want to continue to work on, I think you see like as we're thinking more about the end game experience, a lot like when we launched the Apollo 4, we thought of end game really as a journey from like really from 50 to 100, like the things you're doing along the way and getting all of your prepare on the lips and leveling those glyphs up and going deeper in the nightmare dungeons and you know going eventually confronting low.

1478
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,000
That was what we kind of imagined or thought that the end game would feel like and that was a good thing for us to build on.

1479
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I think we saw that a lot more players were looking for end game like explicitly at level 100.

1480
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:55,000
That was when they wanted a lot more things to open up and we made a lot of changes recently to try to like create more gameplay around that part of the experience between like the itemization changes and the crafting changes and also the introduction of like tormented bosses and of course the piviar officer.

1481
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Yeah.

1482
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
So I think that like we know that there's more opportunities for us to build on these things, right?

1483
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I think you've heard me say this before but you know a lot of things we're doing in season four specifically really are done to like build a new framework, you know for how end game sort of functions.

1484
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:15,000
The things that drive a player for the things that get them excited and the content that they engage with along the way as well, right?

1485
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:24,000
We want to make sure that they're having that players are having a really fun time or a warning time while they're playing Diablo 4 and they can find opportunities to be appropriately challenged as they go through the experience as well.

1486
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:31,000
We think there's more opportunities for us to kind of like grow and expand the offerings of things that players have access to the things they can go experience.

1487
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
You know at that stage of the game.

1488
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Awesome question from old dudes new games and I love these names. They're so good.

1489
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:49,000
What about codex resetting when swapping characters that was actually just an issue on PTR like when you when you swapped characters and stuff like that.

1490
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Yeah, when you use the boost NPC.

1491
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Yeah, so that that was not a thing that you will experience in season four.

1492
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And so that's not a common thing or a normal thing that's supposed to actually happen.

1493
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I just was a bug that we had in PTR.

1494
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:14,000
There's a lot of questions here about the mind cage and I just want to maybe clarify with the players.

1495
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Opus Crocus says if you consume more than one does the mind cage stack or does the timer reset.

1496
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Time reset I think.

1497
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
The timer reset timer reset.

1498
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Okay, and then in regards to again this is from optics.

1499
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Do K or do mind cages trigger for a single player or your whole group if you're grouped up.

1500
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Single player.

1501
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Just a single player.

1502
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Yeah, it's a personal thing.

1503
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Okay, all right.

1504
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
So clarity around the mind cage is in it.

1505
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
We've had a lot of people ask specifically about that.

1506
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
And we want a feedback on this by the way too.

1507
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
So when you get chance to play with the mind cage during the season like you know,

1508
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
tell us what you think.

1509
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Want to know.

1510
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
This is from new poo games.

1511
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Do unique items get a stat slash functionality boost since tempered legendaries are just straight up better.

1512
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And is it generally not worth it to equip a unique item after the patch?

1513
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Yeah, I mean, I think Adam can speak to some of these changes if you wanted to jump in.

1514
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
But we've done a pass on all the unique items.

1515
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:20,000
We've done things like razor plate because four thorns apics is and we change what the legendary power is.

1516
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Yeah, by the way, that was a big question we got from people of the PTR because they're like,

1517
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Hey, what about razor plate?

1518
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
We heard a lot.

1519
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
In that patch, razor plate.

1520
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Yeah, it's actually in the patch notes.

1521
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
And yeah, it's a lot of thorns.

1522
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Razor plate is blarious.

1523
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
It's a whole way.

1524
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I wanted to just have like one so you can't miss on master work.

1525
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Yeah, but what I'll say about the unique to legendary item power level, I suppose, is that we knew when we were making these tempering changes and updating those that we wanted

1526
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
legendaries because they kind of have a jerk like they have kind of different identities right now in the game.

1527
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
And so we're still figuring out what we wanted with unique long term.

1528
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:04,000
But the idea is that like legendary items or items really they have a journey and you know, you're working on them and there's a story to them.

1529
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
And you know, you get it.

1530
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
It's not like a one stop shop.

1531
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
You're done kind of like how they were before.

1532
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Unique.

1533
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
So part of our identity is that that I get them.

1534
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
You get a unique and it's freaking awesome.

1535
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Really powerful and very exciting and you have it and you're done with it.

1536
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
And so we're keeping this discrepancy of like what their purposes are in the game for now.

1537
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
And kind of seeing how it goes.

1538
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:29,000
We did take a look at some Uniques, but we didn't like do a whole pass of like, you know, every single unique now has five outfits or something like that.

1539
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Like we wanted them to be a little bit different and different identities.

1540
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,000
So we do kind of expect that Uniques may be less prevalent than they were before.

1541
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
We still believe though that a lot of Uniques are really key for various builds.

1542
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:47,000
And so you're still going to want them, but you're not going to want like a unique and every single slot on your character now.

1543
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Because it's clearly always better, right?

1544
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Sometimes some of those will want more Uniques, some will want less.

1545
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
And we want to kind of see how that plays first before making sweeping changes.

1546
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,000
You know, some obvious rows we could take is like adding crafting to Uniques.

1547
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
What if you could temper them?

1548
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
What if you could do these other things, right?

1549
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:10,000
We know that that's a thing and we may do that in the future, but we're kind of evaluating this world where it's not clearly always you only get one or the other.

1550
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
And we kind of want to see how that goes first before making any big changes.

1551
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Yeah. And the fixed nature sort of has you consider it's part of your optimization puzzle.

1552
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Well, I'm going to give up some tempering affixes to get this unique, for example, in my chess slot, for example.

1553
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
We sort of want to see where that goes. Like we think that that's that's fun.

1554
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,000
And we think that the excitement of a unique is those are those fixed stats.

1555
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
When you see the item on the ground, you know, like, okay, that's that's the unique.

1556
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I can just equip it. I don't even have to work on it.

1557
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Yeah, it's just like there for me.

1558
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
So awesome.

1559
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:48,000
And then I know by the way, did we talk about a master working or not mass working?

1560
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
We did talk a lot of talk.

1561
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
We've done it twice on two.

1562
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Did we talk about groups and I with the pit?

1563
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I didn't write it down and I didn't talk about it.

1564
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we got a bunch of feedback that, you know, it sucks to help someone with their pit run and just not get any master working materials.

1565
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Like, well, why am I here?

1566
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,000
So what we've done is we've made it so that the person who opens the pit is going to get a hundred percent of the master working materials.

1567
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Previously, I think it was split maybe across all players.

1568
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:29,000
And what we've done now is that the person who opens it gets a hundred percent and then everyone who helps defeat the pit gets 50 percent of that target goal.

1569
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:35,000
So we're trying to walk that line where group play isn't just like totally overwhelmingly efficient, but you're still getting something for helping each other.

1570
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Go through those pit levels.

1571
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Yeah. We heard a lot of feedback about players going like, yeah, it feels a little unrewarding to it.

1572
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Yeah.

1573
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Totally. There were some changes. In general, there, I think there's still some tension with how players feel about the efficiency of groups, which is the efficiency of solar play with awesome and things like that.

1574
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:56,000
These are things we're thinking about. We have ideas on, but we want to continue to get feedback, particularly with these changes and kind of see how things play out.

1575
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Absolutely. Awesome.

1576
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:06,000
We're getting questions about, you know, hey, are there any updates on social features and things like that coming to to D4?

1577
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I don't know if we have anything to share right now. Right. It's something obviously that team is very well, you guys ask all the time.

1578
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
So we're very, very aware of it. And the team is been looking at it.

1579
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
And once we have more to share, we'll end up sharing it with you guys. But for right now, we don't have any update.

1580
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:34,000
There's questions about it. Is there, if there's plans of adding maybe potential leaderboards to the pit or anything, or is that going to be something that's just exclusively on the gauntlet?

1581
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I think the idea of adding leaderboards, other types of content over time, makes sense. Could be pretty fun.

1582
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:46,000
But right now, we really want to see how the pit plays on its own. The trials feature on the challenge ladder.

1583
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:57,000
We really want that to be a place where players can, or other other, plays we really want players to be able to go and compete in a very fixed environment, in a very extremely fair environment, which is like the what we really prioritize as part of the release.

1584
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:03,000
The pit has pretty variable runs and runs so that it's a little more complicated. It doesn't mean that we would never add it.

1585
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I think that there's a clear indicator that there's be pretty fun to have this slightly looser leaderboard, associated with a feature like this.

1586
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Yeah. But we're going to see how things play out and we'll be thinking about how we can add more competitive features like that to the game over time.

1587
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Question from El Roqueer. I didn't pronounce that right, but when you're talking about El Roqueer, I think that is actually nailed it.

1588
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:32,000
It's like an elbow game right now. Not since not everyone actually experienced PTR because PTR itself was on PC BattleNet, but they were asking when tempering can you keep previous roles?

1589
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Can you keep previous roles?

1590
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Oh, with the enchanting system.

1591
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Currently right now, we don't have the functionality to let you keep the role. Right now, if you're going to commit to re-rolling, you're going to lose that role.

1592
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
You're committing to the role.

1593
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Yeah.

1594
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:52,000
That's sort of like the blacksmith is hammering on that item and then locking different aspects of the weapon you sort of lose what you previously had.

1595
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:59,000
But we're open to feedback, right? It's completely new feature. We really want to hear how it's playing and then ultimately what we want is a fun crafting feature.

1596
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
So if that sort of feedback is really valuable.

1597
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:15,000
We'll take two more and one is from Matt LOL is tempering going to allow changes for the skill type, like maybe lightning hydras or maybe changes to Blizzard where it's a rain of fire or something like that.

1598
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
That's pretty cool.

1599
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Honestly, anything an app could do is open season of things we could potentially do in the future.

1600
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Not in season four, but you know, possibly in the future.

1601
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Awesome. And this is actually from a lot of space to grow.

1602
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
There is a utility category that we can use a lot of space to get to.

1603
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Yeah, there's a lot of questions in here about like additional character customization options and stuff like that coming in the future.

1604
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:51,000
It is like something the team is always looking at adding additional things to for players to have more choice of what they want to do, especially as they're creating characters.

1605
01:54:51,000 --> 01:55:04,000
And of course, being able to obtain those, like even just some things in season four of being able to get additional, you know, cosmetic things for your mount and everything like that is something that the team is most definitely looking at.

1606
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Yeah, we actually, we care about this a great deal.

1607
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I think one thing it's very interesting about Diablo 4 or a problem that we have that's very specific right is there are actually quite a few cosmetics for players to earn out on bosses and things like throughout the game.

1608
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
There's lots of things for players to collect, cosmetically in the game.

1609
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:26,000
But it's really hard to know that that drops off that thing in Diablo 4.

1610
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Like you can go and you can fight like a world boss 50 times and not have a drop occur for you.

1611
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Like then eventually you get your special horse like, oh, okay, it is here, but you have no idea.

1612
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
It's kind of like it's hard to know exactly where to grind.

1613
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
We're actually talking about that a bit on the on the dev side.

1614
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:45,000
See if like there's more ways of you can kind of like make it clear where certain things can be found, which I think could be really fun.

1615
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Yeah, but I think there's work we can do there.

1616
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:51,000
And also there's still work we can do about just trying to get more cool looks into the game.

1617
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:56,000
So we've been talking a lot more with the various teams inside the inside Diablo 4.

1618
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And there's a broad agreement we want to bring more cool stuff to you guys.

1619
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:05,000
And more cool stuff for players to find and pick up and equip and feel like it was really exciting to get that thing.

1620
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:12,000
One thing we're doing like already is we're like as we develop more uniques, we're trying to make sure we have like more unique appearances to go with all of them.

1621
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
We usually have like a lot of really really fun ideas.

1622
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:21,000
We have to constantly play wrestling with like, alright, we only have like this X many swords, but like we have like this many ideas for swords.

1623
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
And we want to try to get this into the game.

1624
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
We want to wait until we have the artwork for a sword.

1625
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,000
We usually try to make sure we've got a fun toy immediately giving you.

1626
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
But we're going to make sure we're trying to get more of that stuff in game as well.

1627
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
So there's just even more artwork to the unique system for players to collect.

1628
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Awesome.

1629
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
So that's all the time we got right here for today.

1630
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,000
We went over all the changes or not actually there's even more changes.

1631
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
There's actually more changes in the patch and us.

1632
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
We can't go through every single line in the patch notes over a stream.

1633
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
So you guys can actually check out the patch and us.

1634
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
There's will be available on dapple4.com.

1635
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
We always have those listed on our specific patch notes page.

1636
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
And those will be live immediately after this stream.

1637
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Season four, loot reborn starts on May 14th.

1638
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
This is across all platforms.

1639
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
It's on PC Xbox, PlayStation.

1640
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:17,000
And of course if you're an Xbox and PC game pass user, you can also play dapple4 now via PC BattleNet or on your Xbox.

1641
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
So lots of opportunities to play.

1642
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
And of course steam, steam, can't forget steam.

1643
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Steam is also on there for PC.

1644
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
That's also a platform.

1645
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
That is also a game platform for everywhere.

1646
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Any other platforms you wanted to shout out?

1647
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
We're everywhere.

1648
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Yeah, we're everywhere.

1649
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
It's everywhere.

1650
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
But again, thanks to everyone for tuning in.

1651
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
We're looking forward to you guys jumping into season four, loot reborn.

1652
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:43,000
And yeah, we'll see you guys in game.

1653
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
And thanks again.

1654
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Thank you guys.
