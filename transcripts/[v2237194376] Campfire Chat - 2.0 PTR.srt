494
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
In Vessel of Hatred, we travel south to Nahantu,

495
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
a region with both deep ancient jungles and vast sprawling plains.

496
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's the last stretch of land in Sanctuary's eastern continent,

497
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and we've packed it full of experiences for every type of player.

498
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
In this expansion, there's a whole lot to explore

499
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
under the dark canopy of Nahantu.

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Nahantu is the southernmost region of the eastern continent

501
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that Diablo Forest has been taking place in.

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's the last region that we haven't visited yet,

503
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
so far in the game.

504
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But it is one that we've been to before in Diablo.

505
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There's lots of new areas.

506
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We have six in total.

507
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Four of them are jungle themed,

508
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and then we have two that are red rock, canyon,

509
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
but each one of them has their own unique identity.

510
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
When you first arrive in Nahantu,

511
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
you're in this place called Lingering Hatred.

512
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
This is a high tree tops canopies,

513
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
where you're almost walking amongst the branches

514
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
high above the jungle floor.

515
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Imagine a thick canopy that the light is just barely poking through.

516
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The whole area has been infected by this thing called the Hollows infestation.

517
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The Hollows are a new enemy that's associated with Mifisto.

518
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They themselves are kind of like a tar-like substance creature

519
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
born straight out of the depths of hell.

520
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It feels a little twisted,

521
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
there's a sickness to the area itself.

522
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Humans have ventured into this deep part of the jungle

523
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
where there's all this poisonous plants and flora.

524
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The dregs actually started experimenting

525
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
with eating these hallucinogens,

526
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and it put them into this aggressive psycho rage.

527
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The dregs were pretty fun,

528
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
because we were able to push more variety into Monster Family.

529
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You have one of these tall dregs,

530
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and then half of a body of another dreg on top of it,

531
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
kind of controlling it,

532
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and telling it where to go,

533
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and tossing poisonous bombs at the player.

534
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
When you come across, it's very memorable.

535
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And then we've also got the area of Tengansi,

536
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
where you've got the Tengansi Plateau,

537
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
which is full of these red rocked plateaus and canyons.

538
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Imagine getting up above the land.

539
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Those gigantic walls have pockets inside,

540
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
where monsters could live.

541
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It offered up a lot of opportunity to bring back

542
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
a Monster Family like the Lucunite.

543
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We're bringing them back in a new way here

544
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
as a fully fleshed out Monster Family with multiple classes.

545
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What a more brute force looks like.

546
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What a cast it looks like.

547
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
They are very much apex predators,

548
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
and we're definitely in their territory.

549
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And then there's a little sub-area called the Skittering Earth.

550
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The name alone makes your skin crawl.

551
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's bug infested,

552
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and you can see how the bugs have destroyed the jungles

553
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and kind of input their influence on it.

554
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Within the field of giants,

555
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
you have these giant corpses of these long dead demons

556
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
that humans have begun to mine away out for their resources.

557
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
While they've got a lot of use out of them,

558
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
they're also toxic to the land around it.

559
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The notion of massive demons walking sanctuary a thousand years ago

560
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
is really thought provoking.

561
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Plateaus also got just this beautiful color scheme to the lighting.

562
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's really lovely to be there.

563
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And then horrific at the same time.

564
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You know it's great.

565
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The mercenaries in Vessel of Hatred are a group of people who

566
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
we like to describe as ordinary people with extraordinary skills.

567
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
They have the same level of will to fight against the demons of hell.

568
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And there's four mercs that you can collect over the course of the campaign.

569
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It starts with here a blacksmith and a shield bear is a more defensive fighter.

570
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
He's up to go in there and soak up damage.

571
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It uses his shield as a bulwark against the enemy.

572
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Meet him early on in the campaign,

573
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and he's one who introduces you to the mercenary network.

574
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You end up finding acquisition quests for three other mercs

575
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
that you can find throughout the course of the story.

576
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Subo the Drunken Archer is going to work really well for people who want

577
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
someone who's out of the main melee in the back offering utility

578
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and that kind of range supports.

579
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And we have Variana, a berserker cron who's a melee combat fighter,

580
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
a close range.

581
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
They've got a really cool combat meter, a massacre meter,

582
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
where you need to keep killing enemies to get the meter to be filled.

583
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Just got a bunch of really interesting utility skills that you can kind of build him.

584
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Finally we have the demon child Aldkin,

585
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
who's a magic user who can transform himself from human form to demon form,

586
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and join you in combat.

587
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There's this really great reinforcement ability where you can take one of the mercenary skills

588
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and attach it to one of your powers so that when you use that skill,

589
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
it calls them in to do a specific skill.

590
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
With the mercenaries for Vessel of Hatred,

591
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
one of the things we are expanding on is the skill tree.

592
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
For Diablo III you had a very basic type of mercenary,

593
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
but this time you can actually push a little bit more into the skill tree

594
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and make the mercenary the way you would want to play.

595
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Going through each mercenary progression arc and outfitting their skill tree

596
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
so that it's complementary to your character build,

597
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think that's where the fun in the mercenary system really lies.

598
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The Dark Citadel is a new and game feature that's coming in Vessel of Hatred.

599
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's an entirely a whole operative, player experience.

600
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
All the mechanics within it and are based around you working together

601
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
with your party members to solve the challenges and face the first cosrera hordes within.

602
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
One of the outcomes of the major wars is this giant crater

603
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and all the souls that were kind of lost in it from those wars.

604
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The goal of the first cosrera who are kind of the original cosrera,

605
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
they're using the powers within the Citadel found within this crater

606
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
to perform experiments to try and bring back that Dark God.

607
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Only recently people have started going missing.

608
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
They head into the cosrera region, they disappear never to be seen again.

609
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So it's clear that whatever their planning is about to come to fruition

610
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and your job is the players to get in there and stop it.

611
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Citadel is a place where we take what is the best part of Diablo,

612
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
combat, and we test it in a different way,

613
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
which is adding in cooperative mechanics that you have to manage on top of that.

614
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
For example, a boss has an attack and as a player,

615
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
you have to collect an item that allows you to reflect the attack back at him.

616
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So there's a little bit of a twitch level mechanic there,

617
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
we actually have to time your reaction shot.

618
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What's interesting about it is when you get multiple people in there

619
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
where each responsible for reflecting that shot once,

620
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
so we all have to master the timing of that move.

621
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You can't do that kind of thing without coordinating as a team

622
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and that's sort of the example of what Citadel gameplay feels like.

623
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
When designing the Citadel, we designed a lot of really cool bosses.

624
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And so one of the things that we did is we took that design

625
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and made like armor sets for each of the classes.

626
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That way you feel like you took their armor

627
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and you feel like you're wearing a little bit of them after your victory.

628
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We also have a currency that's dedicated to Citadel

629
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
where as you play through, a vendor can be interacted with

630
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
to buy custom cosmetics that are unique to the Citadel.

631
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You can play with two people, but the ideal experience is for four.

632
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
In order to facilitate that, we've built an all new party finder feature

633
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and the community has been pretty vocal about wanting this for a long time.

634
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It made a lot of sense to us to pair it with this new Citadel mode.

635
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It really is an activity that's geared towards people

636
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
who love to play together with their friends or with strangers

637
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and enjoy that cooperative gameplay.

638
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I cannot wait for players to get into the world.

639
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm really just excited for people to see all the little hidden

640
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
storytelling elements that the team has fit in.

641
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
There's interesting things to find in the scene, discover around every corner.

642
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And it's just a really great experience getting to explore and how to.

643
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm going to show you how to play the new Citadel mode.

644
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm going to show you how to play the new Citadel mode.

645
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm going to show you how to play the new Citadel mode.

646
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Hello, Diablo community.

647
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Welcome to another Campfire Chat.

648
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
This is the Patch 2.0 Campfire Chat for PTR.

649
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
As you guys can see, we're in a little bit of a new environment.

650
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
We're all doing this from home.

651
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
We had to do a quick last minute pivot about 24 hours ago.

652
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I was struck by some con flu after games calm.

653
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But I just wanted to give a quick shout out to our production teams

654
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
behind the scenes.

655
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Lucas Jaden Rich, they made a quick pivot to allow us to do this

656
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
and for us to be safe.

657
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And to be able to still give you guys this exciting information

658
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
for Patch 2.0.

659
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm going to show you how to play the new Citadel mode.

660
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm going to show you how to play the new Citadel mode.

661
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
To lead us off, I do want us to do some quick intros for everyone

662
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
here on the actual panel.

663
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So Colin, would you like to start off the ad intros?

664
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah, sure.

665
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm Colin on the design team.

666
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Hello, I'm Aislin Hall.

667
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm a systems designer with a focus on live balance.

668
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hey everyone, I'm Charles Dunn.

669
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm a class designer working on the live balance for Diablo 4.

670
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Hey everyone, I'm Jeevin Sadoo.

671
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And I also work on the systems team.

672
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Awesome.

673
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
So we got a whole panel here way more than what we normally have

674
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
because we have so much to actually cover.

675
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We do want to jump into things pretty immediately.

676
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But I did want to recap really quickly.

677
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Obviously, last week we were at Gamescom.

678
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
We made some really big announcements for Vessel of hatred

679
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
where we announced, you know, the mercenaries

680
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
that will be coming to Vessel of hatred,

681
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
along with how that system works with like reinforcements.

682
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's like a new take of how mercenaries play within Diablo,

683
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
especially since mercenaries has such a storied history

684
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
within the franchise itself.

685
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And of course, we also talked about the cure ass under city

686
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and the dark citadel, along with the party finder feature

687
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
that players will be able to actually partake in with Vessel of hatred

688
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
and use that for dark citadel and other features within the game.

689
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
We do actually have a blog up on Diablo 4.com

690
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
that does do a good deep dive across all of those specific items.

691
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So you guys can actually check that out.

692
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But we have a packed agenda today.

693
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
This will be a long one.

694
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So we hope that everyone will sit down and grab a snack

695
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and join us as we talk about some pretty large systemic changes

696
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
that we'll be coming with Diablo 4.

697
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Along with some new stuff that we'll be sharing as well.

698
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That we'll also be coming with Diablo 4.

699
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So we're going to start off with some progression updates.

700
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
We're going to move off into some class and balance changes,

701
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
along with some quality of life updates.

702
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And then we'll kind of cap it off with a cool new announcement

703
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
that will be coming with Vessel of hatred.

704
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So, Aisling, Colin, I know you guys want to jump into some of these big progression changes

705
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
that you guys were talking about last week.

706
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So take it away.

707
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, thanks Adam.

708
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And I'm sure everyone has no idea what the big surprise is at the end.

709
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So yeah, right.

710
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So yeah, let's jump into the progression.

711
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So when we launched the game,

712
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
we had a sort of vision for the game that we felt like was really fun to play through once,

713
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
where you'd sort of traverse through these world tiers

714
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and you'd be gaining new sacred items rarely.

715
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And then you'd be getting ancestral items when hopping into World Tier 4.

716
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And as we played the game more and more and as we've gotten feedback,

717
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
that necessarily hasn't really been super fun.

718
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So we've sped up a lot of the progression to sort of get you into that space

719
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
that where you feel powerful,

720
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
where you have autonomy over your choice in terms of difficulty and challenge and reward.

721
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Diablo is all about that progression, right,

722
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and sort of blasting and feeling efficient.

723
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So we wanted to take a step back after looking at itemization.

724
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
We've added a ton of itemization progression that we think is feeling pretty good.

725
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
There's a lot of ways to customize your character.

726
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There's a lot of ways to progress your itemization.

727
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And we wanted to look at other aspects of the game.

728
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So that came in the form of like what hasn't aged super well,

729
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
what are the things that we really enjoy and we see that you all enjoy

730
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and doubling down on that.

731
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So two, those things are difficulty and overall just character progression

732
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
from your paragons, your glyphs, etc.

733
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And we've sort of taken the approach of like really doubling down and embracing

734
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
again what has been really fun, right, blasting, being efficient,

735
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
having control over your challenge and reward, right.

736
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Profane Minecages is awesome when you can stack it to three

737
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and you can hop into those health ties and just start getting tons of experience

738
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
and reward for pushing that challenge.

739
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Keyed Dungeons, like Nightmare Dungeons and Frontal Hords,

740
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
really pretty much every endgame in the system at this point

741
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
has a tearing system associated with it.

742
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And we think that's like pretty indicative of like what has been fun

743
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and we want to embrace that.

744
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And part of that is that idea of I can push really hard

745
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
to get more efficiency, part of that's conquering milestones, right.

746
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's really good.

747
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's a ton of fun to hop into World Tier III early.

748
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I think I hopped in at level 25 and the latest release just to see

749
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
if I could do it and it was a ton of fun.

750
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And it's sort of all about embracing that gaining power

751
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
in multiple ways, feeling super powerful.

752
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And then another thing that we really wanted to look at in terms

753
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
of making this better is alting.

754
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
We made a change to make it so that the mythic uniques

755
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
could be equipped at level 35.

756
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And if you've done that, it's really bad.

757
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's an experience where you know, roll a barbarian,

758
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
slap a ground fought there on them.

759
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And you just blast through the leveling experience

760
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and it's a ton of fun.

761
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That being said, we've added tons of sort of power to the equation.

762
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And we wanted to make sure that we also gave you more autonomy

763
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
to sort of challenge yourself with all that new power.

764
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And we're adding a ton of new power and the expansion as well.

765
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So to cover it again, we want to look at expanding the progression

766
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
in other areas of the game, come patch 2.0.

767
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So with that, Aislin actually has a bunch of exciting changes

768
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
to talk about here.

769
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I do. Thank you, Colin.

770
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Okay, everyone.

771
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I want you to put on your thinking caps

772
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
because we have a lot of details to cover.

773
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So buckle up.

774
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
We in fact have a topic screen here

775
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
because there's so many things regarding progression

776
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
that we're going to be talking about today.

777
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So the way that we're approaching this presentation is

778
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
we're basically going to be bringing you through

779
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
what a character's journey would actually look like, you know,

780
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
starting by talking about the character journey

781
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and then talking about some difficulty tier changes that are coming.

782
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And then going deeper into, you know,

783
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
how you're going to be gaining more rewards

784
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
from those sad difficulty tiers.

785
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So, yeah, without further ado,

786
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
let's simply jump in and get started with the character journey.

787
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Okay, so some changes coming to how you're going to be leveling up.

788
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
There's going to be a level adjustment, first of all,

789
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
coming to patch 2.0.

790
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Right now in the live game, you know, you go from character level 1 to 50.

791
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Those are your skill point levels.

792
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And then every level after 50 is a Paragon level

793
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
where you're earning four Paragon points per Paragon level.

794
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
We're going to be splitting those out in patch 2.0.

795
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And so you're going to earn Paragon points

796
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
which are going to be separate from your character level.

797
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Levels 1 to 50 represent those character levels.

798
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And there's also going to be a new max character level,

799
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
quote unquote, of level 60.

800
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And that means that you are going to be earning 10 more skill points

801
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
from what you had been earning pre-patch 2.0.

802
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
There's also going to be a reimagined pace to the leveling journey.

803
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So we have a lot of new difficulty tiers

804
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
that are being added to the game more on that soon.

805
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But effectively, lower difficulty tiers

806
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
are going to be offering you a slower pace

807
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
if you're in your player.

808
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You just want a very casual chill experience.

809
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But you're going to be able to bump it up if you want to.

810
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Like if you're engaging with tempering,

811
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
you're engaging with all these systems

812
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
that are making your character stronger,

813
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
and you want something to test that against,

814
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
we are aiming to give that to you.

815
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And these difficulty tiers are going to be offering you improved efficiency,

816
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
improved rewards, and the goal is to improve your pace.

817
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You can blast through these difficulties.

818
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah, this is a lot of work.

819
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The mind cages, right?

820
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Like we sort of heard, yeah, we heard you like mind cages

821
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
so we put it in the game systemically.

822
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like from whispers to Hell Tide,

823
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
literally everything in the world,

824
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
like maybe like doing dungeons.

825
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And really, it's sort of like giving players that choice

826
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
to do what they want.

827
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And it's not just Hell Tide now that can push that difficulty.

828
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yeah, totally.

829
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Like we were just playing on the development team

830
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and we were playing in Hell Tides and playing with mind cages.

831
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And we were like, this is great.

832
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Like I want to just be able to do this,

833
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
or like have this option available to me,

834
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
like basically whenever I'm playing.

835
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So that's a big part of these changes.

836
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Moving on here to the number adjustments.

837
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So as a lot of you guys found in footage,

838
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
yes, there is a pretty substantial number adjustment.

839
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So a big part of this is we want to make sure

840
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
that there's room for growth.

841
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And we're adding a lot of player power in Patch 2.0

842
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and Festival of Hatred.

843
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And we want to make sure that numbers don't get so crazy,

844
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
that we cannot even fathom them.

845
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Right?

846
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And so a big part of this is giving us a good starting point

847
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
in Patch 2.0, where we can't afford to grow numbers.

848
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah.

849
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So yeah.

850
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah.

851
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah.

852
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I think it's really important to have numbers that are like,

853
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
when you're doing damage numbers to see ones that are meaningful to you.

854
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
If you're increasing your damage like even 10x,

855
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
but it's taken it from like an eight or nine digit number to a 10 digit number,

856
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
it's almost impossible to see that kind of growth in player power.

857
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So with numbers that are more readable on screen,

858
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
that A makes it much more obvious when you're getting more powerful

859
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
and just makes the game as a whole easier to kind of comprehend.

860
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Totally.

861
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Yeah.

862
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And it's important to note that like this is relative in that we're not slowing you down in any way.

863
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
This is purely sort of one of those adjustments that we're making to ensure that you can have more growth in the end game.

864
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
We're not at the top end nerfing things like crit chance or CDR.

865
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Really, this is all about having actually like sort of what we set out to do

866
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and we launch the game and have more grounded numbers for longer.

867
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That's not to say that you aren't going to get insane in the deep end game, right?

868
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah.

869
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yeah.

870
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You're still going to have a lot of power to game.

871
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And yeah, finally, just going back to this first bullet here on this slide.

872
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We're going to talk more about Paragon later,

873
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
but for now we're going to focus on some other things.

874
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So sit tight.

875
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay, let's talk about how monsters are changing.

876
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So we've streamlined monster health and damage in a pretty big way.

877
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:08,000
We took a look at how monsters gain health and how they gain damage over different difficulty tiers.

878
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And we've really like honed in and kind of universalized our approach to how they're gaining power throughout your character experience.

879
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And this is going to be applying to all monster types, you know, normal monsters, minions, which are elites, little buddies,

880
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
elites themselves, and of course bosses.

881
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And all of these monsters now have health that's relative to their normal monster counterpart on any given like difficulty tier.

882
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And what this does is it really helps smooth difficulty progression and the difficulty of any experience that you're currently in.

883
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Secondly, we have some changes to monster scaling.

884
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Monsters are going to scale to a pit here, and we're going to talk more about that as well pretty soon too.

885
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So sit tight.

886
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And the big thing here is that monsters are always going to match the player level now.

887
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So on live, we have a world where monsters can be, you know, a hundred levels offset of you and anywhere in between.

888
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And that can be fairly hard to understand.

889
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And so a big part of this pass is kind of removing that elements of the game so that we can focus on what difficulty we're currently in and using that as the judge of how hard or how easy or wherever in between the content you're currently in.

890
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And finally, we have some pretty cool combat tuning changes.

891
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So we've taken a lot of looks at, you know, like the moment to moment combat pacing in the game.

892
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And monster mechanics across the board have been adjusted to really hone in on player momentum.

893
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You know, you're here to slide our demons. We want you to move quickly through the game.

894
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And we don't necessarily want monsters to be slowing you down, especially normal monsters.

895
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And to achieve this, you know, we've reduced instances of getting one shot out of nowhere.

896
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And we've also adjusted boss HP so that they're not quite as grindy after you're moving in from, you know, after blasting down AOE packs in the pit, for example.

897
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Yeah, definitely.

898
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Great. I'll go ahead, Charles.

899
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah, they're just saying, right, that's always been the pain point in the pit so far is like, hey, you're really strong.

900
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You blast through most of the dungeon and then you get up to the boss and the boss takes, you know, five minutes or more.

901
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
That's just like such a slog. So we're definitely making sure it's a more consistent experience in a given difficulty tier.

902
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You're going to have a more consistent experience across boss and another portion of the game.

903
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah, and we've already taken a lot of steps towards this and brief the one of the previous seasons.

904
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
We said it so that you wouldn't get armor cap penalties as the monsters leveled higher than you, right?

905
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So this is really just sort of consolidating a lot of the, I'm going to get shit for the Blizzard math on the back end to make sure that like a lot of the things are really being reworked on the back end to address the problems we see online with the crazy exponential scaling of boss health from like four different multipliers.

906
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And the crazy exponential damage that some of the monsters are getting.

907
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes, the corpse, both, of course, dying in one shot from off screen.

908
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:36,000
A lot of those things should be much more consistent as you're climbing through those difficulty tiers which we're going to talk more about in the future or in this presentation.

909
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Very soon, in fact, like right now, difficulty.

910
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Let's talk about it.

911
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So this is our beautiful Blizzard illustration, if you will.

912
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Art by Colin.

913
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Thank you very much.

914
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That's a Colin.

915
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah.

916
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yeah.

917
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
We've got a lot of art for this.

918
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This is art.

919
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
What are you talking about?

920
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah, this is beautiful.

921
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Modern art.

922
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah, you can see we have the big bone boss very, very sad that the current state of things up there.

923
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So what this is basically illustrating is that there are basically brackets right now on live where various content is relevant.

924
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You have world bosses that stay relevant for a certain amount of time.

925
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
You have hell tide that stays relevant, you know, maybe a little bit longer than world bosses do.

926
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Then you have world tiers one and two.

927
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Then you have world tier three, which is very sad.

928
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Sorry, world tier three.

929
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah.

930
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And then world tier four.

931
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You like to find glass, you can see it.

932
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yeah, yeah, maybe if you look really closely, you can see how long it takes to go through world tier three.

933
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And then world tier four, which has like a bit of a tale, but still pretty short.

934
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And then we compare it to like where our characters power currently exists, which is, you know, you've got level one to one hundred.

935
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And then of course, your journey throughout all of the pit tiers.

936
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And basically what this is illustrating is a lot of these content types fall off.

937
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
World bosses don't stay relevant forever.

938
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Hell tide doesn't stay relevant forever.

939
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
The world tiers you're living on in the open world don't stay relevant.

940
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And eventually it simply becomes about running the pit.

941
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
And that's the place where you can judge your character's strength.

942
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
We don't necessarily want the game to work that way.

943
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
We want a lot of activities to stay fun and interesting and engaging for as long as possible.

944
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And so to accomplish that, we've got some pretty big changes coming to difficulty tiers.

945
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So let's dive into the meat and potatoes of this talking about pit arbitration.

946
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And that's just a fancy way of basically saying that the pit is going to be something behind the scenes that's setting the pace of all difficulty in the game across all content types.

947
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So pit tiers are going to match difficulty tiers.

948
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:10,000
There's going to be five pit tiers per standard difficulty, which is just encapsulating four new world tiers pre level 60, which are normal hard expert and penitent.

949
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And then there will be 15 pit tiers per torment difficulty.

950
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And they're going to be four torment difficulty tiers, one, two, three, and four.

951
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Difficulty tiers are going to derive monster health damage and intensity from the pit tier that is associated with that difficulty tier.

952
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And I know that's a little complicated, but we're going to have some some supporting stuff to show what this means a little better pretty soon.

953
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And I do want to call out intensity here. Colin, do you want to talk about monster intensity raising between difficulty tiers?

954
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah, so intensity is something we played around with in the base game and it sprinkled out throughout throughout the game.

955
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But when what intensity is is it's a backend system that controls monster aggressiveness as well as monster intelligence.

956
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So by aggressiveness, it's things like they attack faster. They have lower cooldowns. They move faster.

957
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And then intelligence is they predict your movement more. They'll face you more. So you know, it has a big swing.

958
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
It's actually going to try and track you a little bit more accurately.

959
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So it's not just the health and damage that's going up through these difficulty tiers.

960
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
The monsters are actually becoming a little bit more dynamic and fast-paced.

961
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And we think that feels pretty good, especially when it's sort of scaling through the new difficulties here, system that we have.

962
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Yeah, this is something we currently we do have on on the live game, but you know in the new patch 2.0, you're really going to feel that difference.

963
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Currently, feel a little bit of difference in between the different world tiers. And that's just going to be magnified.

964
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And your moment moment combat is it's not just going to be higher numbers. The moment moment will feel different and harder at these higher torment difficulties.

965
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yep, they're going to become bigger jerks as you said difficulties.

966
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Alright, so let's talk about difficulty gating. So this is basically how people are going to be moving through these different difficulty tiers.

967
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So the pit is going to unlock once you hit character level 60, which is the new maximum character level in patch 2.0.

968
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So pit tiers associated with standard difficulties are going to unlock immediately, which is pit tiers 1 through 20.

969
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You're going to be able to challenge all of those immediately once your max level.

970
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And you're going to need to beat pit tier 20 to unlock the first torment tier.

971
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Once you beat pit tier 20, you're allowed to go into the overworld on torment 1.

972
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And then as we see here, there are 15 pit tiers per torment difficulties. So to unlock torment 2, you would then need to progress through the pit and beat pit tier 35,

973
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
which point you can now go into torment 2 in all other activities, so on and so forth.

974
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So this is basically creating a, sorry, go ahead, gone.

975
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Oh, I was going to jump in and say like what's kind of interesting is like torment 1.

976
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You can think about as world tier 3 today. And what we're sort of doing is essentially saying now that level cap is 60.

977
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You actually can find some of the best items in the game very early, right?

978
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Imagine if you were able to just start finding the best items in the game in world tier 3.

979
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
That's really sort of what we're talking about here.

980
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:31,000
We're really speeding up when you can actually get to the end game where we've added things like the pit, we've added things like nightmare dungeons and more end game activities for you to engage with and item modification systems.

981
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So it really is sort of getting you into the fun faster, which also makes alting a lot more cool, right?

982
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's way easier to sort of get to that point where all right, I'm in the end game.

983
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm going to start looking for awesome items. I'm going to start modifying my items.

984
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So we think that that like sort of represents a pretty substantial change to how you play the game.

985
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

986
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm wondering why we kind of built it around the pit.

987
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
You know, and why we associated difficulty with the pit.

988
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
How do y'all think about that?

989
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah, so right now the pit is a fantastic razor to judge your character against.

990
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And I think that this overhaul is effectively turning the pit into the game's backbone to use kind of a gruesome term, but you know, we're Diablo, so whatever.

991
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's basically turning the pit into the game's backbone of like difficulty and all other difficulties is kind of derived from that.

992
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And it gives us a very predictable and understandable pace for you to experience all other activities in the game based on the pit's difficulty.

993
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, not that razor is great for pushing difficulty, right?

994
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You think about how part of what's really fun again about Diablo is that feeling of progression and that feeling of becoming powerful and taking on a big ass demon, killing it, getting awesome loot.

995
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And what the pit is going to do is you're going to push that difficulty then unlock new torment heroes, which is going to unlock more efficiency for you.

996
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And you can sort of think about it as like we've added not just a world tier 5, but a world tier 5 and 6 as part of this torment system.

997
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And it's something we can continue to sort of evaluate and build on as characters become more powerful when we add new ways to sort of play through the system.

998
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah, I think it's also a lot about consistency across content, right?

999
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Currently in the live game, we've got a lot of different levels of different types of things, right?

1000
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
You've got nightmare dungeon keys, you've got pit levels, you've got infernal horde of tiers.

1001
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And we just kind of realize that hey, the pit is something that we have really good delineation between the different levels.

1002
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So you've got a wide spread of different tiers for that.

1003
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And that's something we can kind of peg difficulty against across the whole game to make a more consistent experience.

1004
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So if you're just going to get a certain difficulty tier, you're just going to get a more consistent experience across all activities.

1005
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Right. Yeah. Yeah. So like when you're on torment you, you're going to know that all content you're facing is on the level of torment here.

1006
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,000
But right now on the live game, you know, you have a, you go into a pit tier 50 and you're like, okay, it's pit tier 50 difficulty.

1007
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And then you go into a nightmare dungeon tier 50 and it's a totally different difficulty.

1008
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And then you go into an infernal horde tier 8 and you're like, wait a minute, this is extremely hard compared to these other ones.

1009
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
They're just not similar, right? And so we want to create a more level playing field so that difficulties easier to understand.

1010
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's also like a common language and shared experience for everyone.

1011
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, that's definitely a benefit. And it's also in some sense leveling up all the activities.

1012
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I know that there's some people who really enjoy whispers, for example, and whispers just falls off.

1013
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Like if you're doing the pit in your level 100, your level 90 in the pit, like whispers are terrible, right?

1014
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Like you're not actually going to run whispers when you're pushing that deep into the game.

1015
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:02,000
But now when sort of things are leveling up with torment here, as you have a place to go and sort of juice the efficiency from those different activities, if you like that activity.

1016
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah. And this kind of carries over to other activities, not just whispers. It's like, you know, your health hides.

1017
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah, the whole world is leveling. Yeah, like that it's, which is another thing like infertile hordes is something that obviously this is introduced in season five is coming back and is a permanent future within the game and is also going up with the rest of the content.

1018
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Yep.

1019
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:34,000
All right. So let's talk a little more about the details of difficulty tiers.

1020
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So on the right hand side here, you can see this table. It's basically showing off the associated pit tier with any given difficulty tier.

1021
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So normal simply starts on one and then like we saw before, it goes up by five each time until you get to torment tiers, at which point it goes up by 15 each time.

1022
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So torment four lands on 65, torment one starts on 20.

1023
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And in light of this, we have changed the highest pit tier to be 100 down from 200.

1024
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And this doesn't mean that the pit tier 100 is going to be the same difficulty as it is on live. It's going to be harder.

1025
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So each pit tier you're going up is going to be harder than it was before effectively.

1026
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And we also have this pretty neat new system where we have smart keys.

1027
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And what that means is your things like infernal hordes or nightmare dungeons.

1028
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,000
The keys to enter those activities are now going to follow the current difficulty tier that you're on.

1029
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So if I have an infernal hord key and I'm on torment three and I use it, I'm going to go into a torment three difficulty infernal hord.

1030
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And the same is true for nightmare dungeons.

1031
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So we're pretty excited about that change because again, coming back to all these things we've talked about where just kind of makes things easier.

1032
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Just makes life easier.

1033
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah, it's a big quality of life change because on live right now you get a bunch of sacred, you know, nightmare dungeon keys.

1034
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And I'm sure everyone runs a ton of world three nightmare dungeons, right?

1035
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You definitely don't just pop in to get a sacred weapon.

1036
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
But what I'm getting at is a lot of those keys just end up getting salvaged.

1037
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And now when all keys can sort of carry weight through various torment tiers, I'm getting a nightmare key.

1038
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Is this interesting choice of like, well, do I keep it or do I run it now because if I keep it, I can just use it at a later time.

1039
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And it's really about giving player the players that choice on when do they want to run this content.

1040
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We're not just going to invalidate that key and say, oh, in torment two, you need to find a new key to do this thing.

1041
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So I think it's definitely making key management a lot easier and more fluid as well.

1042
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And one thing on the pit, Hazeln that I think is really interesting is we definitely have rescaled the pit tier 100.

1043
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Tier 100 is sort of like our 200 on live.

1044
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But I think that's something that, you know, we definitely want to keep an eye out on PTR.

1045
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We don't have any problems with increasing the amount of pit tiers.

1046
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Like this is something we can definitely revisit if we see in PTR that you're all are insane, which is probably going to happen and you beat tier 100.

1047
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
We really like that it's a razor and measuring stick and we don't want to take that away from players.

1048
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So that's something that we want to get PTR feedback and we could really use your help in breaking that system and seeing how far you can push it.

1049
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, yeah, that's a great point.

1050
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And, you know, like we've said on this stream, there are going to be a lot of new player power opportunities coming.

1051
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And so, yeah, please show us what you got as they say.

1052
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Okay, so let's talk about, let's just dive a little more into the details.

1053
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I think we went over a lot of this stuff already, but we can kind of go through this slide here.

1054
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So, yeah, all content in the game exists within an expanded difficulty tier selection, like we were talking about.

1055
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I think an important thing to call it here is that, for example, penitent is if you're comparing it just to like kind of understand what it's going to look like relative to live right now.

1056
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Penitent is kind of going to end up being like World Tier 2.

1057
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
If you added 45 monster levels on top of it.

1058
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And that's intended to kind of be the upper echelon of like pre max level character leveling.

1059
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So, if you really want to amp up the difficulty to as hard as you can make it like going onto penitent is where you want to be.

1060
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And this is just a lovely little visual aid.

1061
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
We've got some cool new icons for these difficulty tiers.

1062
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Normal, hard, expert, and penitent. It gets harder as you keep going.

1063
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So, yeah, and we really want this to be like opt in not progression locked.

1064
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And so the vanilla Diablo 4 difficulty tiers kind of operated as progression tiers, right?

1065
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And what I mean by progression tiers is the moment you get to World Tier 3 as Colin was saying, like you unlock sacred items, maybe you go into a dungeon so you can find the sacred weapon.

1066
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
And these things unlock so quickly and they drop so frequently that you kind of just got this huge burst of power.

1067
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And you never really got to feel that power.

1068
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And we want to make sure that you are like feeling each upgrade you get in the game and it feels really, really punchy.

1069
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And we really want these new difficulty tiers to be player guided.

1070
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Like we want you to be able to make your own decisions on when you're moving on to the next one and what's the right pace for you.

1071
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And of course these new difficulty tiers are going to give you improving rewards.

1072
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
You're going to find more gold, more experience, and you're going to have more loot efficiency per difficulty tier.

1073
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:02,000
So the higher difficulty tier you can fight the game on, the more efficient your experience is going to be effectively.

1074
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Yeah, I think that's really good.

1075
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Oh, good.

1076
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I just say that's really like what I view is the differentiating factor between what current before is and in the new patch 2.0 is if you enter Torment 1, you can find the best item in Torment 1.

1077
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
You could complete your character and get full best install and everything.

1078
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It's just going to take a while.

1079
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It's going to be less efficient.

1080
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You're going to be getting less loot.

1081
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And whereas in the live game right now, you just can't find the best things in World Tier 3.

1082
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You are kind of obligated to go to that World Tier 4.

1083
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:43,000
And now if you're able to clear higher Torments with efficiency, that's just going to be the best option for you to find the gear more efficiently.

1084
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But you aren't forced into Torment 4 to find the best items in the game.

1085
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Yeah, that's something I've really liked about it is that we get to start the end game a lot earlier with Torment.

1086
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
There's nothing that you're excluded from.

1087
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
There's no awesome piece of loot that you can't find by Torment 1.

1088
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And so you get to really start to test your build after it's gotten some real optimization.

1089
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I think much earlier into the journey than before.

1090
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I couldn't agree more.

1091
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It's a great example of what we're doing with the Latter Bosses or the Latter Bosses.

1092
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
All of those unlock in Torment 1.

1093
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
The cost to summon them is static.

1094
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It remains the same throughout all the Torment tiers.

1095
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And what that means is if you can beat it on a higher Torment tier, you're going to get way more unique.

1096
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So you get a handful of unique starting in Torment 1.

1097
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Way more unique than obviously Torment 4.

1098
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
But the cost because it remains static, we're not going to ask you to get anything extra like a Stygian stone.

1099
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
That just means as long as you can kill that Torment 4 boss, you're getting way more efficiency out of that boss.

1100
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And it really is like this, it feels amazing to sort of progress through those Torment tiers and just unlock way more power opportunity.

1101
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah, we don't really have this differentiation of like a regular version of the late game boss, like a regular version of Duriel.

1102
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And then the tormented echo of Duriel.

1103
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
That's not really a distinction that we have anymore.

1104
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Whereas like previously it would cost more materials to summon the tormented version, but it would give more rewards.

1105
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Now it's the same cost across the different Torment tiers.

1106
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It's just if you're able to conquer him on Torment 4, that's where you're going to get the absolute most bang for your buck in terms of resources in to loot out.

1107
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Yeah.

1108
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And I want to just double down on like, Torment 1 is where the end game starts now.

1109
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And just each Torment tier that you're ascending is making your end game, you know, more fun, basically.

1110
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Because you're going to be getting cooler stuff or more frequently.

1111
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Okay, so enough about difficulty tiers. Let's move on to some itemization changes.

1112
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So items strength, we have what I like to call the item power shuffle happening in patch 2.0.

1113
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Items with item power above 540 are going to be adjusted to 540.

1114
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And I fixed bands in lieu of this or in addition to this rather are going to be adjusted as well.

1115
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So yeah, items at the new character level max are going to they're going to max out at 750.

1116
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
That's not actually the highest item power that's going to be in the game and we'll talk about that more in just a second.

1117
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But most items you're going to be finding once you hit max character level will be item power 750.

1118
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And you're going to be finding much better item power items from levels 51 to 59.

1119
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
There's going to be big item power jumps.

1120
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,000
So once you start leveling your character past those original 50 character levels, you're going to start finding a lot better gear.

1121
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Okay, so let's take a look at what an ancestral item looks like in patch 2.0.

1122
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Oh, okay, we yeah, let's let's take a look here real quick.

1123
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So you'll notice here that this item has 800 item power, which is 50 higher than the max 750 that I was talking about before.

1124
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You'll also notice on the right hand side that that is the torment icon.

1125
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So ancestral items can be found starting on torment one.

1126
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:39,000
They're going to become more frequent as you ascend torment difficulties, but they're still going to stay pretty rare throughout all torment levels.

1127
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You'll also notice that the greater a fix on this item is highlighted.

1128
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
That is because now whenever you find an ancestral item, they're always going to have one greater a fix.

1129
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
They can roll with more, but they will be guaranteed a single one every single time.

1130
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
So let's dive in more into the details.

1131
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Right, Hazeln is part of finding a greater a fix on live right now.

1132
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Sometimes it's on life per second.

1133
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
That's like, oh, okay, I got a greater a fix on life per second.

1134
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But now when you see an ancestral item, it's always going to have a greater a fix.

1135
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And that ancestral eye power bump, the a fix bump is going to feel really good.

1136
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Even if you miss that a fix, it's still a huge upgrade to your character if you haven't found one of these before.

1137
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Yeah, and sometimes right, you get an item that has multiple greater a fixes on live.

1138
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And it's not at 925.

1139
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's not at the highest item power.

1140
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And that's kind of a mixed bag right?

1141
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Well, it's kind of good, but it's a lower item power.

1142
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And now things with greater a fix will be definitely at that highest item power.

1143
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Yes.

1144
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Okay.

1145
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So let's talk about the details here.

1146
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
So sacred items are not going to drop anymore.

1147
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
They're kaput.

1148
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
You're going to be looking at normal items pre-tormants.

1149
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And then you're going to be chasing ancestral items once you are in torments here.

1150
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
So yeah, starting in torment one, they're going to start to drop.

1151
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
As I said, they're going to become more common as you go up.

1152
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But again, they're going to stay fairly rare.

1153
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
They're never going to, you know, be like the only thing that's dropping.

1154
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And ancestral items are intended to be where you're finding forever items.

1155
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So when you find like a really good ancestral weapon or, you know, of whatever slot that you may not have an ancestral item for, that's going to be a big moment.

1156
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
That's going to be an exciting moment where you're going to get something a lot better.

1157
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Because they also have their own a fix band as well.

1158
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So these ancestral items are going to have better a fixes than their non-an ancestral counterparts too.

1159
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Something to note is that greater affixes only drop on ancestral items.

1160
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
You're not going to be finding greater affixes on non-an ancestral.

1161
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So when you see a greater affix drop on the ground, you're going to know that that is an ancestral item.

1162
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And ancestral items also have two tempering slots up from one on non-an ancestral.

1163
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
And their masterworkable up to 12, whereas non-an ancestral are masterworkable up to four.

1164
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And finally, they are going to have higher aspect ranks too.

1165
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:20,000
So you're going to find legendary aspects that become better on ancestral items.

1166
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And Charles, we actually added a ton of power to legendary aspects to accommodate this.

1167
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:30,000
We didn't just sort of readjust where those power bands are coming from.

1168
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Yeah, all of the legendary aspects that now scale a little bit further into the ancestral tier.

1169
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
We basically just tacked on five new levels kind of on top of the current value.

1170
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:46,000
So you're just going to find even more powerful legendary effects than you have currently in the new ancestral tier.

1171
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:54,000
It's going to be a lot of fun to find those.

1172
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Okay.

1173
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Let's move on to Paragon.

1174
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
So we have some pretty big glyph updates coming with patch 2.0.

1175
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,000
There's been a significant rework to how many ranks you can earn on any given glyph from 21 to 100,

1176
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
which is a lot of new ranks.

1177
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
But we want to make sure that there's still texture in that system, right?

1178
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And so because of that, we also have a new, rather a new glyph rarity, legendary.

1179
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,000
So once you upgrade a glyph to rank 46, it becomes a legendary glyph,

1180
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
which you can see here on the right.

1181
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
This spirit glyph is level 50.

1182
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So it's past that 46 markets, legendary.

1183
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
You're going to get a glyph radius increase at rank 15, which is already in the live game.

1184
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But you're also going to get another radius increase at rank 46 when it becomes legendary.

1185
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And this is making them bigger than they could have been previously.

1186
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
So you're going to get more space with your glyphs because of this.

1187
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And when a glyph becomes legendary, it also unlocks a significant bonus more so than it did before.

1188
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And you can see that on the bottom of this glyph here, it's got the legendary bonus increases critical strike damage by 21.6%.

1189
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
And it's very important to note that this is a multiplicative bonus.

1190
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
This 21.6% is not an additive bonus.

1191
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
So you're going to be getting a lot of power from that bonus there.

1192
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
The thing else I want to bring up is that glyphs are moving to the pit.

1193
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So you're going to be upgrading your glyphs in the pit.

1194
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
You're no longer going to be upgrading them in nightmare dungeons.

1195
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
And it's going to be an attempt-based system.

1196
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
So when you finish a pit run, you're going to go to the end,

1197
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
and you're going to be able to have some chances to level up your glyph.

1198
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And increase their ranks.

1199
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And if you are in a pit that is 10 tiers higher than your current glyph,

1200
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
you're going to have guaranteed success.

1201
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:07,000
And for every 20 pit tiers that the pit level you're in is higher than your current glyph that you're trying to upgrade,

1202
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
you're going to get bonus ranks so that you can accelerate the process.

1203
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Do you want to speak more to that, Colin?

1204
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Yeah, I think this is really important, no, because you could easily look at the rank 100 and be like,

1205
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
oh my god, the grind is even longer.

1206
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But based on how that upgrade chance works,

1207
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
it's guaranteed as long as you're beating pit tiers that are higher than your glyph.

1208
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And then how that bonus map ends up playing out is if you're beating, for example, a pit tier 30.

1209
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That's roughly somewhere between today's World Tier 3 and 4.

1210
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
You can upgrade a glyph from 1 to 15 in 3 runs.

1211
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,000
So you think about the difference between today's game and patch 2.0,

1212
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
you're getting those glyphs leveled way faster if you're pushing that difficulty.

1213
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And what we really wanted to do here was we've heard a ton of feedback around how the XP system for Nightmare Dungeons feels really grindy.

1214
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
It also just doesn't serve the Nightmare Dungeons very well.

1215
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It's like, how do I get to the end as fast as possible, but nothing in the dungeon matters.

1216
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And what that does is in the pit, it's all about speed and efficiency, and it sort of embraces that.

1217
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And we think that that's just really going to accelerate your pick lift upgrading speed.

1218
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And the chance you can sort of, I want to be really clear with the chance the chance base system is essentially there

1219
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
because it felt really bad when it was binary.

1220
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Like when we said, hey, you need to beat the pit tier or you need to beat a pit that's 10 levels higher than your glyph.

1221
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
And if you don't, you get nothing. That just felt really bad.

1222
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
So the chance is not there to increase the grind or slow down progression.

1223
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It's actually just there to protect from like it feeling just terrible to not get literally anything from that run.

1224
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
So again, to be clear, it's 100% chance as long as you're pushing difficulty.

1225
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,000
We think that this fits the content a lot better. We've heard a ton of feedback around like the pit rewards feeling lackluster.

1226
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And there's not really a reason to push difficulty.

1227
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:08,000
You sort of just want to hone in on like 90 or 101 depending on where you're at in terms of your progression journey on live.

1228
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
This system really encourages you to push and gives you a tangible reward every single time you do it.

1229
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And I think it's important that there's the consistency of like the communication between, right?

1230
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So hey, my glyphs are currently level 50. Well, what kind of pit tier should I be approaching to upgrade these?

1231
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Well, somewhere in the range of 50 to 60, right? You're just a little bit higher so that you can keep pushing that harder content.

1232
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And also if you have a glyph down at level one, because maybe you haven't paid attention to that glyph, it's going to level up much faster if you are already proven yourself proven that you can tangen and pit tier 50, for instance.

1233
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
You're going to level those up very quickly.

1234
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I think it's also cool as if you have a build that you feel isn't doing as well as you go up in torments and makes it a lot easier to kind of snap something back in and catch up faster.

1235
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Yeah, the further you progress, the easier it is to to level those up.

1236
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,000
So here we have a video basically just showing off what the new UI looks like for upgrading a glyph in patch 2.0.

1237
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So you can see that it's showing you the current pit level you're on, the current success chance to get a rank up.

1238
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:30,000
And something else I want to call out is that when you are, oh, yes, right. So this is rank 45 to 46 explicitly, which is the moment where you are increasing a glyph from rare to legendary.

1239
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And something important to note about that is that it does cost a fairly significant amount of gym fragments as well, but it's giving you that increased radius size and the new multiplicative legendary bonus, which is pretty sick.

1240
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
And here we have an example of showing how the radius gets even bigger in patch 2.0.

1241
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I want to call out here that the midpoint says level 21, that is not correct. It is level 15 where the radius increases.

1242
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But yeah, previously there was only one radius increase. Now with legendary glyphs at rank 46, there is a second radius increase.

1243
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Okay, so let's talk about some more stuff related to Paragon.

1244
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:25,000
We have realm partitioning for Paragon now, and this is kind of getting into all things that Colin was talking about.

1245
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,000
We have realm based Paragon points now. So your Paragon points are going to be shared across an entire realm.

1246
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And remember that what a realm is is like either seasonal soft core or seasonal hard core or the same free turnal. Those are realms.

1247
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And these Paragon points are going to stay latent on a pre level 60 character. And what that means is that, you know, if you have, let's say, 150 Paragon points on a realm, those Paragon points will remain inactive on any character that's pre level 60.

1248
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:12,000
But once you hit level 60 on that character, they will have those 150 Paragon points. And it's also important to note that any Paragon points you earn on any of your characters in that realm are going to be shared among all characters in that realm.

1249
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:23,000
So if you earn 25 or 50 Paragon points on one character and then hop over to your alt, you're going to have 25 or 50 more Paragon points to spend on that character too.

1250
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And in addition to this change, we have a pretty hefty Paragon level increase. So right now the current max besides renown and ultraviolet bonuses is 200. And we're increasing that up to 300, which is going to give you a lot more levels to chase throughout any given season.

1251
01:10:47,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And in light of these changes coming to Paragon, we've made some adjustments to the way that boards work as well. So because we're offering so much more power with legendary glyphs and they mean so much more to your build.

1252
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:09,000
You know, we're looking to set a maximum for the number of Paragon boards that you can equip at any given time.

1253
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And this is also because you know, on live right now, the best strategy is to aim for as many glyphs, lots as possible. You just go off, you oftentimes ignore whatever legendary node bonus you're getting just for the glyph slot.

1254
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And we want to make sure that you're really focusing on these legendary nodes and that you're focusing on these really cool legendary glyphs that you're getting.

1255
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And really think about those choices instead of gunning for like every single glyph, for example.

1256
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
So complimenting a relational.

1257
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I was just going to say this really helps compliment the additional 100 more levels. Like we've heard a lot of feedback that it feels really flat.

1258
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Once you hit 100 that there's just no more progression. You don't really need to kill any of the monsters anymore unless it's explicitly to get the the loop drop off of them.

1259
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And that that kind of kind of feels bad, right? Like I'm walking through this dungeon and like I get literally nothing out of killing these these monsters.

1260
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:14,000
So with the board limit, we've packed a ton of power with additional paragon levels to grind a ton of power with the legendary glyphs.

1261
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But it also creates a situation where once you're sort of you've achieved all those different things, you don't feel so bad necessarily around not getting to that paragon level 300.

1262
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:34,000
At a certain point, you start to really just sort of really need to hone in on your build and those extra paragon points are going to start providing you more of a show of sort of how bad as you are.

1263
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And give you incremental progress that's a little bit less sort of demanding that you must grind through all of this content to unlock every part of your paragon board.

1264
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Yeah, and something I'm pretty excited about this is that you know sometimes on live, it can feel like my goal is to get a new paragon board.

1265
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And as soon as I achieve that, my goal is to get a new paragon board and get off the one I just unlocked.

1266
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:03,000
And I think this change really lets me kind of explore the boards and think about what specific route optimizations I want to take.

1267
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:11,000
And let's me personalize that a little more, which I'm pretty excited about.

1268
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Well, I know we have a we just went through a ton of content right here with all the the changes that are coming for progression to paragon to itemization.

1269
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I know it was a lot for people here. We will actually have a blog immediately up after the stream that will kind of also explain a little bit more of this to players so that they can actually get a understanding in their own cave and stuff like what it what is going to be changing with patch 2.0 for Diablo 4 in regards to some of the progression items.

1270
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I know Colin we're seeing a lot in chat of like, you know, people are noting like, hey, this feels a little D3-ish in ways.

1271
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I don't know if you wanted to chat or like comment on that a little bit more.

1272
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Yeah, I'm happy to. It's definitely familiar, right?

1273
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:07,000
So we thought a lot about like, what is the right way to address the player feedback of we've gotten a bunch of feedback around like World Tier 5, World Tier 6, World Tier 7.

1274
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I want to be able to level up the challenge in the game. I want to be able to get more efficiency.

1275
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And we wanted to do it in a way that was leaning into what we saw you all were really resonating with, which is getting to the endgame faster.

1276
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And we felt like, okay, well, we could add a World Tier 5 and add ancestral Uber, ancestral and increase the level cap.

1277
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:35,000
But that would mean you just need to grind more to get to that point where you're finding your forever items doing item modification.

1278
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And we get out of World Tier 6, Uber, Uber, ancestral, right? And it just sort of made us reevaluate what is important.

1279
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And what's important to us is getting people into the endgame, getting people finding their forever items, smashing monsters, getting more powerful sort of item modification and efficiency.

1280
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And so that was part of it. And then the other part of it I'd say is I think Diablo 4 more than any Diablo has had a ton of item customization and power along the leveling journey, which really makes the leveling progression feel different, right?

1281
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Like if you're tempering, if you're imbuing aspects, if you're really min-maxing your reward scheme, you can really push difficulty tiers early.

1282
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
If you've played D3 hard, it's really the only real difficulty, right?

1283
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:32,000
But because we have so many different ways to grow your power, we think that represents a pretty fun challenge of like how do I take all these pieces and really push as early as I can to get to that max level faster.

1284
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:48,000
And one more thing that's really important to note is the jumps between torments are pretty enormous. We don't expect you to sort of play it like today's D3, where you essentially log in, get your hatred set and hop right into torments 16.

1285
01:15:48,000 --> 01:16:00,000
The jumps are actually pretty enormous between torments 1 and 2, and it creates this really fun progression through those torments tiers, and it feels like a meaningful step forward when you get into torments 2 and then a torment 3.

1286
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:09,000
We're hoping this doesn't necessarily feel like a two hour sort of journey through the torments tiers and then now you're in torment 4, and that's how you play the rest of the game.

1287
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Yes, and also one thing I'll add is, you know, shout to Twitch chat, everything that you say, hey, you like what we're doing, big dub, we appreciate it, much love for the response.

1288
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Also, all the people in Twitch chat who are like, I don't like this, this isn't working for me. Much appreciation to say, you know, we're looking at what you're saying, we're thinking about it, and we're going to try to incorporate it and make the game better.

1289
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And I think it's interesting, I'm seeing this sort of Diablo 3 references, and it's like, from our perspective, if something really worked well in Diablo 3, that's more important to us to do the thing that the players felt like was working for them than anything else.

1290
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,000
The fact that we've done it before in any form, to me, wouldn't stop us from doing the right thing, you know what I mean?

1291
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Yeah, and I just drew it the right way for D4. Sorry, I'm doing everything around, it feels like it's like a Zoom call, but interrupting each other.

1292
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And also, a big, big shout out to Twitch Chef for calling out Given's court banishment.

1293
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I've seen that message a few times already, but so thanks, Aislin, thank you, Colin, I know Colin's going to be joining us more on a couple other topics, but we still have a lot to talk about in this stream.

1294
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And the next thing that we do want to talk about is class changes and everything, and so Charles will be taking us through all the class changes for Patch 2.0.

1295
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yeah, awesome. So before we get into some of the slides and details, I just wanted to thank Colin and Aislin for talking about all the systemic updates that are coming, how we're going to test your character and how you're going to progress through it.

1296
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:08,000
But my topic is going to be a bit more about what are the exact abilities and skills and new legendary effects and unique that you're going to be getting to take on these awesome challenges that are set up through the difficulty tier system.

1297
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And also a slight disclaimer, you know, PTR is a very early build for whatever is going to go live on Patch 2.0, and some of the assets that we've captured here are also still early on, and so some of the exact numbers or some of the wording may slightly be changed.

1298
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So definitely refer to the patch notes, which we're going to be publishing right after the stream for the exact details and kind of final and air quotes numbers that are going to go on the PTR, and of course still may be subject to change before we actually launch Patch 2.0 live.

1299
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:47,000
All right, so with that out of the way, let's start talking about some of the tempering changes that are going to come in Patch 2.0.

1300
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So tempering is a system that we introduced back in season of loot or born, season 4, that gave you a way to really customize your items and kind of make your build your own.

1301
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:09,000
And we've received a lot of feedback on the tempering system, and we're really committed to iterating on and making sure this system is the best that can possibly be going forward.

1302
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:19,000
One of the key points of feedback that we heard was around weapon tempers, so these affixes that you get to attach to your weapons, your weapons are your big important part of your build and your character.

1303
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And there was a big disparity here, where some affixes that were on weapon tempering were multiplicatively increasing your player power, things like double projectiles or things of that nature or bash cleaving, which was a multiplicative bonus.

1304
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And others, not so much, right, you had some other ones that were more duration or size effect, and they just were hard to compare against each other.

1305
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And so going forward and patch 2.0, we've made all weapon tempering affixes multiplicative damage increases, oftentimes to very specific skills.

1306
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And to accommodate this, we already have one bonus projectiles, and now we're going to have new affixes that give skills chance to deal double damage, which means if figures the chance to deal double damage,

1307
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:11,000
the entire skill is just going to do twice as much damage as before. Every hit of it will deal double damage. It's kind of an all or nothing kind of deal.

1308
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And then the chance to hit twice is the chance for any time it deals damage, you just get an extra hit of damage. And this allows you to trigger things like lucky hit procs or anything that counts the number of times you deal damage.

1309
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
That's going to trigger an extra time with the hit twice.

1310
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Offensive tempering affixes, these are the ones that can also go on your weapons, but can go on other spots as well. These are going to be additive damage increases.

1311
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And these will often be to broader categories like the bonus fire damage or bonus critical strike damage, and whereas the weapon temperers are often talking to more specific skills.

1312
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And so here we can see an example with the Shadow Augments execution, where we have the several projectiles chance to cast twice.

1313
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:02,000
But now we've got new ones that are chance for reep to hit twice, so you cast reep, and every target you hit there's just a chance to get two hits on that target instead of one.

1314
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And corpse explosion, whenever you cast corpse explosion, there is a chance for the entire skill to deal double damage to every target that it hits.

1315
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Additionally, we've moved those size and duration affixes, which we think are really cool and really interesting ways of modifying your skills.

1316
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:24,000
We've moved those over to the utility category, so they're not directly competing with these multiplicative damage increases.

1317
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:32,000
You're not going to feel bad that, oh, I'm missing out on damage, just to make my area hit a little bit larger or have a longer duration on a buff.

1318
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,000
So there's not as much opportunity cost to invest in in those size and duration affixes, which are still really cool ways to customize your character.

1319
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
We just don't want them to compete with damage.

1320
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And finally, we know that oftentimes tempering leads itself to, hey, I see this list of five or even six affixes sometimes.

1321
01:21:50,000 --> 01:22:00,000
We really are going to try to be limiting tempering recipes to at most four affixes that could possibly roll on them, just to give you a little bit better odds of actually hitting the one that you care about and the one that you want.

1322
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And just to be a little bit easier to kind of comprehend. And even so, we're trying to set this limit at four, but oftentimes we're aiming for just three on the recipe, depending on how the grouping them together in ways that make sense.

1323
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:27,000
So this is an active area that we're working on, really trying to make sure that it's not quite, it's easier for you to get the right affix out of the temporary recipe by limiting that number that are on there.

1324
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,000
All right, next up we've got changes to ultimate skills. So ultimate skills can now gain skill ranks.

1325
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:40,000
This is probably pretty self-explanatory, but just like every other skill in the game, ultimate skills cannot be ranked up to rank five in the skill tree.

1326
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And just like every other skill increasing the skill rank will increase the damage output of your ultimate skills.

1327
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:50,000
But it's also going to give you cool down reduction on these ultimate skills as well.

1328
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:57,000
So oftentimes other skills you just kind of get one or the other, right, sometimes it's cool down reduction, sometimes it's a damage or healing increase.

1329
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:05,000
On ultimate skills you're going to get kind of the best of both worlds. It's going to be increasing the damage output and reducing the cooldown.

1330
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And finally, effects that do grant bonus skill ranks on this, such as, you know, Harlequin's Cress, the Shaco, that gives plus to all skill ranks.

1331
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,000
These are only going to apply to ultimate skills that you've already learned in the skill tree.

1332
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And this is to make sure that you still can only equip one ultimate skill. You can't like it plus ranks to all skills and then suddenly have access to for ultimate skills.

1333
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:33,000
We still want that. We still want you to just pick one, but you're just going to be getting, you're going to be able to really juice that ultimate skill up.

1334
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:40,000
If you really want to make, you know, last rate be really strong. That's going to be a powerful effect that you can invest more skill points into.

1335
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Alright, so those are some of the general updates. Let's now talk about the new content coming for each individual class starting here with our barbarian.

1336
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Alright, so sometimes you're playing as a barbarian and you experience a problem, right? You are standing here and there is an enemy over there. What to do?

1337
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Well, a good barbarian is going to throw their weapon at the enemy over there to kill them at a distance.

1338
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Alright, so now we've got a new skill called mighty throw that's going to hurl your weapon at an enemy. It's going to deal damage on impact and then it's going to stick in the ground and do some pulses of damage over time.

1339
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
So even if the initial impact doesn't kill them, there's going to be some extra pulses there.

1340
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Additionally, we've got some upgrades for it just like our other skills enhanced mighty throws can increase your attack speed while the weapon is out.

1341
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And then you can either opt into fighters mighty throw, which is going to give bonuses to that pulsing damage, causes your weapon swaps to pulse for more and give you a bit of barrier.

1342
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Or you're going to opt into my warriors mighty throw, which is going to dramatically increase the initial impact damage and it's going to stun enemies on impact.

1343
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Let's take a video clip of this in action.

1344
01:24:48,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Alright, so we've got barb, just simple example here with a few enemies, you know, throws out this, you know, ephemeral version of the weapon, lands deals a big chunk of damage and then pulses over time before returning back to you.

1345
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
That was a huge fan of double throw in Diablo 2, so this is really exciting.

1346
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Yeah, it looks sweet too. It kind of like bluish yellow, like ancient, kind of color scheme to the VFX looks awesome on it.

1347
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
So range barb is definitely happening in patch 2.0.

1348
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
For sure, if you want to spec really heavily into this, yeah, you're going to be throwing weapons out like crazy.

1349
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Alright, so we've also got some new key passives and new legendary paragon notes for every class year.

1350
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:43,000
So for Barbarian, we've got barbed carapace. This is going, this is a key passive, so it's going to increase your thorns based on how much fear you're spending.

1351
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And whenever you cast a skill with a cooldown, it's going to grant you unhindered for a duration, which allows you to move through enemies.

1352
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,000
And then enemies that are close to you are going to take bonus, or are going to take damage from your thorns every second.

1353
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
You're going to kind of pulse damage of your thorns every second.

1354
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Now this is really cool. It really enables thorns barb, which we had a little bit of support for, but you know one of the big problems of thorns is that you really wanted enemies to hit you and hit you quickly.

1355
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And this gives you another alternative to deal bonus damage or to really pay off for building up all that thorns with this new key passive.

1356
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Additionally, we've got a legendary paragon note, the force of nature. Your earthquake has a chance to spawn dust devils and your earthquake damage is going to be increased by your damage against close enemies.

1357
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:33,000
So this is really plays into these, these earthquakes and dust devil effects, which we kind of call subpowers internally.

1358
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:40,000
These effects that are not skills that you cast directly, but you know some of your legendary effects will, will spawn these earthquakes and dust devils.

1359
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And then we're just a new way to really power those up and blend them together in the same build.

1360
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Additionally, we're adding some new passives to the skill tree.

1361
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:59,000
And this has really helped to give you away along with ultimate skill ranks to spend a lot of those new points that you're getting by leveling up from 50 to 60, you know those new skill points you're getting.

1362
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
We're going to use some new ways to invest those.

1363
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:10,000
But we also got some new items, of course. We've got the ugly bastard helm, a new unique helm for barbarians.

1364
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,000
And it makes you so ugly that whenever you are berserking, all of your damage is converted into fire damage.

1365
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And so that's really interesting. You know, bar bars always have this little bit of like light fire theme. You had a few different effects that dealt fire damage.

1366
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And now if you really want to play a fire bar, this is the unique helm for you.

1367
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Also playing into that, we've got aspect of flaming rampage, which causes your charge to deal some fire damage.

1368
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And aspect of shattering steel, which will cause your steel grasp on Iron Maelstrom to do some bonus physical damage.

1369
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:50,000
All right, moving on to the druid. The druid gets a new skill, a new core skill in fact, called Stone Burst.

1370
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And this is a core skill that's channeled. It kind of has a very unique kind of input mechanism compared to pretty much any other skill in Diablo IV.

1371
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And as you're channeling it, you target an area, and as you channel it, the affected area grows in size over about one second of channeling.

1372
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:15,000
And at any point you can release the channel, and it's going to deal a big burst of damage to whatever size you can land it on there.

1373
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:27,000
You can you cap it really quickly and just do one pulse of damage to a small area, or you can channel up for a little bit longer and hit a much wider area depending on the exact combat scenario you find yourself in, or how the enemies are distributed on the battlefield tier.

1374
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Of course, we've got our upgrades that increase damage to the enemies hit in the initial radius. So, you know, really doubling down on that single target capability of a core skill.

1375
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And primal stone burst gives you some attack speed and raging stone burst will dramatically increase the spirit cost, but also give it a ton more damage.

1376
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:53,000
So if you have a ton of spirit generation, then that might be the upgrade you look for in stone burst. Let's see a video of this in action.

1377
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:05,000
All right, so you see it takes up. There's like three different levels like small, medium and large in this one that the druid kind of held it for a while, but you could release it at any time.

1378
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And so here you see a kind of rapid firing a lot of quick small shots just because they knew that would be enough to clear out the enemies here.

1379
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And also by your channeling it does some pulses of damage to enemies in that area as well.

1380
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
The channel explosion is so satisfying to blow up just so many monsters.

1381
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Yeah, it's really just amazing.

1382
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:37,000
It looks so sweet too. I really hats off to the VFX artist who worked on making these looks so beautiful, the new skills here.

1383
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
All right, so of course, druid also has new passives, a new key passive called one with nature that really empowers companion builds.

1384
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,000
You know, we've heard a lot that players love playing with companions, their wolves, their poise and creepers, their ravens.

1385
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And this is going to be the key passive for you.

1386
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
So all of your companion skills gain an additional companion and they deal increased damage.

1387
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
And there's also a little bonus basically with the you gain the passive effect of all of the companion skills.

1388
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Now, if you're taking this key passive, you're probably taking these companions anyway.

1389
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:12,000
But just in case, you know, your build is such that, well, I just want to take, you know, two out of the three, right?

1390
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I can put wolves and poise and creeper on my bar, but, you know, maybe you don't have enough skill slots to put in ravens.

1391
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
You're still going to be able to get the passive effect of that when you take this key passive.

1392
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Because we just want you to have tons of these companions really leading the charge here.

1393
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:33,000
We've also got untamed a new legendary Paragon node that plays right into this one with nature key passive.

1394
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Casting a companion skill is going to increase the companion active skill will grant you bonus ranks to all of your companion skills for a time to really puff up the damage of those.

1395
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Just like before, we've got some new passives coming into the skill tree as well.

1396
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I think some of these might have some temporary icons on them.

1397
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Like I said, these were from an early build. Some of the icons or very specific art might be adjusted.

1398
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:03,000
So, you know, bear with us. This is the nature of PTR and early development.

1399
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,000
All right, moving on to some of the items. Oh, no, we've got a video. Oh, right. A video of...

1400
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
That's really cool.

1401
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Really leading a wolf pack here, right? So this includes wolves with the storm's companions to turn them into light and wear wolves.

1402
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And I'm sure there's some other ones here. Like aspect of the stampede is probably involved.

1403
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
You just have what is that seven wolves following you around? You really get to lead the wolf back with this.

1404
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
This is the best video in our presentation. Well, actually, no, sorry. This is the second best video in our presentation.

1405
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
You guys will see the best video in our presentation, but it's so good.

1406
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Yeah. For all you wear wolf lovers out there, this one is going to be really sweet. I'm really looking forward to playing with this in touch 2.0.

1407
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:56,000
All right, so new items. So they've got the stone of them in. This is a unique totem that's going to empower your stone burst, the new core skill.

1408
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So, channeling it is going to grant you some damage reduction. And the final explosion will deal increased damage based on how long you were channeling it.

1409
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,000
So, this just really incurs you to build it up to that max size and let off a huge explosion.

1410
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:16,000
And give you some damage reduction. So you're kind of standing still for a bit. That's okay. Get a bit of bonus damage reduction.

1411
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:22,000
We've got a little bit more legendaries on Druid than the other classes just because stone burst being a core skill.

1412
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:28,000
We know that the kind of bar to make a core skill really viable and useful.

1413
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,000
It does need a good amount of legendary items to support it to really make a full build out of it.

1414
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:39,000
So that's why we've added two legendaries here for stone burst. We've got the aspect of anticlimb burst,

1415
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:47,000
which causes stone burst to deal increased damage. And if you cast it at or above 100 spirit here, it's going to immediately be at that maximum size.

1416
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
So you don't necessarily need to channel it as long as you are casted when you have a lot of spirit.

1417
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:57,000
This synergizes really well with the earth and might key passive, which gives you full spirit when it triggers.

1418
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,000
So you can trigger earth and might and then immediately get a huge stone burst.

1419
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:07,000
We've got aspect of shattered defenses, which alters stone burst in a rather interesting way.

1420
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It causes stone burst or stone burst causes enemies to take increased damage from your other skills for a time and reduces stone burst spirit cost.

1421
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:24,000
This kind of converts stone burst away from necessarily being your primary damage source to being a bit more of a setup skill.

1422
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:34,000
You can kind of debuff enemies and then you can find some interesting builds where you have other ways of spending your spirit and maybe another core skill or bolder or some other primary damage source.

1423
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And then you can use stone burst to kind of set up that build. Really interesting to see how players, well, what kind of builds you make with shattered defenses.

1424
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Additionally, we've got aspect of the rapid bear, which empowers your grizzly rage to apply rabies and increases your poison output storm crow, which is just lightning ravens.

1425
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:01,000
You know, your ravens are not lightning. It looks awesome. And aspect of the agile wolf, which gives shred a fourth attack.

1426
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Shred normally is like a three part combo and now it's a four part combo that deals even more damage on that fourth hit and it's going to knock down enemies as well.

1427
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:16,000
All right. So that is a druid really looking forward to playing some druid and 2.0.

1428
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:24,000
But let's move on to the necromancer because we got a lot to get through. We've got soul riff. This is a new darkness ultimate skill.

1429
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:31,000
So necromancers kind of had three ultimates already. They had one that was blood, one that was bone and one that was related to summoning.

1430
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,000
And now we've kind of completed it and we've added a darkness or shadow damage ultimate.

1431
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Soul riff creates an area around your character kind of follows with you that just constantly deals damage over time.

1432
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And it's going to be sucking out the souls of enemies who you're hitting. And every time it sucks out a soul from an enemy, you're going to gain some essence and you're going to gain a barrier.

1433
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:59,000
So you can stack up this barrier. It helps you be survivable and it deals, you know, really good damage over time.

1434
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Supreme soul riff gives you bonus damage for every soul that you absorb and prime soul riff causes the soul absorption to also apply vulnerable.

1435
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Let's take a video of this in action here. Right. So enemies are coming up super useful Charles, right?

1436
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Now that like you have another way to give yourself defenses. Necro has historically had some trouble with that. Right.

1437
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Yeah, absolutely. I think that's a really important part here. And when we get to the next I talk about some of the passives. We'll highlight. We're adding a bit more barrier into the necromancer's kit.

1438
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:38,000
You know, blood necromancer has always had a really easy time surviving. They had a lot of fortify and a lot of max health.

1439
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:57,000
And really they the other ones like the bone and shadow necro didn't have quite as much survivability. And so now we're introducing more barrier in more places to ensure that that kind of non blood necromancer builds the shadow in the bone and some of the necros have a bit more survivability and are able to scale into that late game pretty well.

1440
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Alright, so as I mentioned the new passives so they have a new key passive called affliction that there's this new concept of affliction where applying vulnerable crowd control or shadow damage over time effects to enemies will apply them with affliction, which is going to make them take increased damage from you and your minions.

1441
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Additionally, when you apply a cursed skill to someone or to an enemy who has this affliction, you're going to do a big chunk of shadow damage.

1442
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:38,000
So this kind of turns your cursed skills, you're decrepify and iron maiden into offensive skills. You can curse an area and then they take a big chunk of damage as well.

1443
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:48,000
And then this will scale up with the bonus damage that you've dealt or that you the bonus affixes that you have for that crowd control vulnerable and shadow damage.

1444
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:58,000
And along that same theme, the new legendary paragon node frailty is going to cause a curse enemies to take more damage from you and so plays very nicely with the affliction key passive.

1445
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:11,000
And once again, more skill tree passives to spend those extra points on. And I want to highlight an acrotic fortitude here in the upper right that gives you just a generic passive that gives you a chance lucky hit chance to gain a barrier.

1446
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:20,000
And so that's going to be really good for anybody who wants just a bit more bump of survivability and to play into the more barrier focused on necromancer.

1447
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Yeah, going back to affliction really quick, I love the idea of using my curses offensively, like as a damage skill, I think that's going to be such a blast.

1448
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Yeah, yeah, really cool to just yeah, definitely going to be blast in a home.

1449
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I think it's really thematic to love playing with it.

1450
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:48,000
It pairs really well with the utility changes now that we have way more size increases in utility gives you so many more utility options.

1451
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Those curses get pretty huge and it feels great.

1452
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Yeah, for all of us who just want to win by debuffs spamming, I love that one.

1453
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Absolutely.

1454
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
All right, let's talk about some of the new items coming for necromancer here.

1455
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:08,000
So we've got a new unique item, the unmaker, a unique helm.

1456
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
This is going to empower the soul rift, the new ultimate skill.

1457
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Of course, you gain some skill ranks to soul rift, because now ultimate skills have skill ranks.

1458
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:24,000
And every 30 essence that you spend while soul rift is active will increase its duration up to eight seconds.

1459
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:31,000
So as long as you're active and kind of spending the essence with the unmaker, you're going to have a very long duration of soul rift.

1460
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And then for every essence that you gain while it's active, which absorbing the soul does trigger essence gain, you're going to do a pulse of damage around you.

1461
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
So some bonus damage.

1462
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,000
And so it really encourages you to just keep soul rift up all the time, be constantly gaining and spending the essence.

1463
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And it's going to be really, really fun to make that build work.

1464
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Additionally, we've got reaping lotus aspect. This empowers your sever, your core skill.

1465
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Sever will no longer return to you. Previously, Sever was kind of an out and back situation.

1466
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Now it just goes out and then it splits into three spectres at the end deals some extra bonus damage.

1467
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And then that's the end of the sever.

1468
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,000
So it really doesn't power it on the swing out and looks really cool.

1469
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:21,000
You have aspect of Fel gluttony that empowers your golem whenever you cast your golems active deals a big pulse of damage around it.

1470
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
And your golem will then consume corpses to reduce its cooldown.

1471
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:31,000
So anybody who really wants to build around making your golem as strong as possible, this is going to be the aspect for you.

1472
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:40,000
And finally, we've got phasing poltergeists aspect, which causes your bone spirit to split into three spirits that deal a percentage of the damage as well.

1473
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I think we've got a video clip of this one because it looks really sweet.

1474
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:51,000
So you cast bone spirit at one target and then it spawns three little mini bone spirits to seek out nearby enemies as well.

1475
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
So it kind of gives you increased area of effect.

1476
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And if there's just one target, of course, it all reconverged back on that same target as well.

1477
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:03,000
But also just adds a bit more AOE capability for your bone spirit build.

1478
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Very cool.

1479
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
All right. So rogue.

1480
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Rogue gets dance of knives.

1481
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
This is a new channeled skill for rogue.

1482
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
It's an agility cut throat skill.

1483
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
And it also has a pretty interesting mechanic where it has some charges that will recharge.

1484
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
And the how long you can channel it is based on how many charges you have.

1485
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
It's going to take one charge per second of channeling.

1486
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
But there's no energy cost or we're just like a normal cooldown.

1487
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Here you can just channel it as long as you have charges.

1488
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
And while you're channeling, you're going to be spinning around.

1489
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:41,000
You're going to be throwing knives at enemies nearby and you're against movement speed and dodge chance.

1490
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Really is kind of like a spin to win kind of build on rogue here.

1491
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
You got enhanced dance of knives, which gives you some charge refund as you're moving with it.

1492
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Because that's what you really want to encourage is this constant motion, this forward momentum.

1493
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And methodical dance of knives drops some stun grenades when you finish channeling.

1494
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Or just blend dance of knives will slow enemies and has a chance to pierce through the enemies that you're throwing the daggers at.

1495
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Let's take a look at this in action.

1496
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Here we got the rogue just going spin in throwing some daggers around at everyone.

1497
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Yeah, this is awesome.

1498
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Ah, I like the speed farming.

1499
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
And that animation.

1500
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Yeah, it's just amazing.

1501
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Absolutely.

1502
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
And you can see there at the end they had the upgrade that drops a bunch of stun grenades at the end.

1503
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
And we're all dead, but you know, if you use this to get into a big cluster of enemies, then you stop the channel.

1504
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,000
You drop some stun grenades, reset some of your charges and you're good to start spinning again.

1505
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
It's fun.

1506
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Yeah, those are perfect for like you run into an elite pack after slaughtering a bunch of normals and it just annihilates the elites that feels amazing.

1507
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Yeah.

1508
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Alright, so we've got new passives as well.

1509
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
New key passive is alchemical admixture.

1510
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
This is empowering your non-physical damage.

1511
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:02,000
So, rogues can do poison, shadow and cold through their various imbubments.

1512
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And when you deal three different types of that non-physical damage, the potency of your imbument skills is going to be dramatically increased for a time.

1513
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And the more bonus damage that you build on your gear for bonus poison, shadow or cold damage, the further that potency gets increased.

1514
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
And also encouraging you to mix and match the different elements.

1515
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:32,000
It's really thematic with the alchemical kind of theme and really supporting a build of rogue that we've kind of had in the game, but really wanted to give that robust support of a key passive for.

1516
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:44,000
And also we've got a legendary Paragon node, the dense macabre, which encourages this kind of one-two combo of cast animability or subterfuge skill increases the damage of your next skill, whatever it might be, by quite a substantial amount.

1517
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
You can cast your dash and then position yourself, cast a big rain of arrows, and it hits very hard.

1518
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Very cool and actually impacts your moment to moment rotation as well.

1519
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And of course we've got the new skill tree passes as well.

1520
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,000
All right, new items. We've got the pit fighter's gall. This is the ancestral unique ring.

1521
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Or sorry, just a unique ring. It's not necessarily that you can find it before ancestral tier.

1522
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And this pit fighter's gall will empower your smoke grenade. So your smoke grenade skill will increase your critical strike damage and then leave a cloud of shadows behind.

1523
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And while you're within that cloud of shadows, you're going to be constantly regaining stealth.

1524
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:30,000
And so there's a lot of interesting ways you can play off of triggering going into or out of stealth.

1525
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,000
And pit fighter's gall is just going to really enable that when you cast smoke grenade.

1526
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
We've got aspect of star shards. This is a new legendary to directly support dance of knives.

1527
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:46,000
And the daggers from dance of knives have a chance to shatter, dealing creating more shards of metal that deal bonus damage.

1528
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:54,000
And you can now use combo points on dance of knives to further increase the channel duration if you've opted into combo points specialization.

1529
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Aspect of poisonous clouds plays well with pit fighters gall. When you gain stealth, you create a cloud of poison damage.

1530
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And aspect of splendering shards, there's just a chance whenever you're hitting a frozen enemy to create some ice spikes.

1531
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:18,000
So if you're freezing enemies because you're playing Alchemic Gladmexture and using Coldimbew, the splendering shards might be a good aspect for you as well.

1532
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Alright, moving on to the sorceress. The sorceress gets a new conjuration skill called the familiar.

1533
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:32,000
This is a conjuration skill that is all three elements. It is a shock skill, a piramancy skill, and a frost skill.

1534
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,000
So there's three charges of it so you can cast it back to back.

1535
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And you summon a familiar of the element of your last skill cast.

1536
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:54,000
If you just cast a piramancy skill, you're going to summon a fire familiar. If you just cast a lightning skill, you'll summon a lightning familiar and same with a cold, you'll summon a cold familiar.

1537
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:03,000
And with the enhanced effect, these familiar will do a bonus effect. So the fire familiar will constantly apply some burning to enemies that it's around.

1538
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
The cold familiar will chill and lightning familiar will stun.

1539
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:13,000
And of course, their damage type is going to be based on what type they are so that it'll benefit from all of your bonus fire damage.

1540
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And that is really great to tap into some of the passive on the sorcerer.

1541
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Yeah, absolutely. So if there's a lot of passive that say, hey, you get bonuses against burning enemies, for instance.

1542
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Now, if you have the fire familiar, that's going to really easily be able to apply that constantly. And you're going to have pretty high uptime on having familiar result because of the way the charge and duration works.

1543
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Let's take a look at this in action.

1544
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:53,000
All right, so initially we cast a frost familiar here, right? It's jumping around and it's landing. It's doing frost damage. Then we cast a fire skill. Now we get a fire familiar jumping around and kind of dive bombing on enemies.

1545
01:45:53,000 --> 01:46:04,000
And then finally, we get a shock familiar, a lightning familiar here that's going to be a lightning damage. So you can kind of mix and match these depending on what skills you use, what combination you cast them in.

1546
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And it's really flexible. It fits into a lot of different builds. You know, even if you're just a pure, say, fire sword, we just want to do fire damage, just want to do burning.

1547
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:26,000
This could still fit because you're just going to be able to summon the fire familiar, but it really reaches its maximum potential as you're kind of mix and matching these to suit the situation and apply the debuffs that you want onto the enemies.

1548
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:34,000
And you can have quite a few of these out for the Sega demonstration. I think we only have a couple of them on screen, but I think you can have up to six, right?

1549
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Yeah, you can have up to six. And that would make a lot more sense once we get to talk about some of the unique items that are coming with this patch.

1550
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:57,000
But first, let's talk about the new passives and we've got enlightenment. This really also plays into the concept of mixing and matching the elements. You see it's got all three kind of colors on there.

1551
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Casting a skill grants a stack of enlightenment or three stacks if your skill was a different element to the one before. So you're alternating here. And whenever you gain max stacks, you're going to become enlightened and you get a ton of bonuses for being in this enlightened state.

1552
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
But then it drops off over time.

1553
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:21,000
It's really a reward for mixing and matching those elements more so than any other key passes we've had on the circle before.

1554
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And similarly with the legendary paragraph node, fundamental release, each fire lightning cold attack, you make an increase the damage they take from all sources by 10%.

1555
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,000
So you really need to hit them with all three types to gain the maximum bonus here.

1556
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:45,000
All right, onto the unique items. So today bindings, this is a unique gloves and this plays right into the familiar.

1557
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:52,000
So whenever you cast familiar with this unique on, you're going to summon all three elemental variants at once.

1558
01:47:52,000 --> 01:48:00,000
However, it does come with a bit of restrictions on it. So familiar duration is going to be dramatically increased and it's cool down reduced.

1559
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,000
But you're going to have one less charge of it. So you won't be able to spam this quite as much.

1560
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:12,000
But you know, you press the button once or twice and then you get the max for familiar is out. They're all over the screen and they're going to last for quite a long time.

1561
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:19,000
This is this unique gloves. It's going to be really, really powerful to if you're all about this congregation build all about amping up the power of the familiar.

1562
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:28,000
So an awesome unique for that. Additionally, we've got new legendaries for the aspect of overheating after channeling and sinrate for a time.

1563
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:35,000
You're going to deal bonus damage to the target and cast the instant rate will refresh and maintain the bonus.

1564
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:41,000
So really just powering up your incinerate charged flash. This is in power is charge bolts.

1565
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:48,000
And after you hit a certain number of enemies with charge bolts, your next three cast of charge bolts will no longer send out bolts.

1566
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,000
They're going to sound big waves of lightning that deal even more damage and it's always going to be a crit.

1567
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:01,000
And then aspect of elemental constellation. Once again, more about the mixing and matching of all three elements.

1568
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Casting one of the elemental skills will summon a matching type elemental dagger that will pierce through enemies.

1569
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:17,000
And if you the damage of that dagger is going to be increased, if you get all three of the different element types in that timeframe.

1570
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:26,000
All right. So I think, oh, right. We've got new mythic unique. So of course, how can I forget new mythic unique items? These are the strongest items in the game.

1571
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:33,000
We've got shroud of false death. And I think the really cool part about this is it's just inherent ethics.

1572
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:40,000
It's going to grant plus one skill rank to all passives. And this is really awesome as we're adding new passes into the skill tree.

1573
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:53,000
This is just a ton of power for this new unique chest. And its effect is if you haven't attacked in the last two seconds, you're going to gain stealth and bonus movement speed.

1574
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Now, stealth historically has just been a mechanic that has been on rogues and a little bit on druids with the werewolf builds.

1575
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,000
But now every class, if you get this mythic unique is going to have some access to stealth, you can drop out a combat for a little bit.

1576
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:12,000
And then you get in the stealth and you get tons movement speed to maybe move on to the next pack or move somewhere else in the dungeon.

1577
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:20,000
And it's a really simple line, all passives. But it's literally all passes, which is insane. Like it gets incredibly powerful.

1578
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Absolutely.

1579
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And we've also got the air of perdition, a mythic unique helm. And this one has as an interesting effect, so it says give into hatred and earn lileth's favor increasing your damage dealt by 60%.

1580
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:49,000
So just baseline, this is a huge damage bonus. And the second line here says slaughtering enemies to briefly steal lileth's favor from or slaughter enemies to briefly steal lileth's favor from nearby allies.

1581
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:59,000
So this means if you're playing in a group with somebody else who happens to have the air of perdition equipped, you are able to steal lileth's favor from them.

1582
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Well, only favor one of you. And you actually gain double the bonus of this, right? If you steal someone else's favor, you get 120% bonus damage. And they would get zero.

1583
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:22,000
But if you're just playing the solo, no one else out there perdition around, it's just a flat 60% bonus damage, which is still a ton and very impactful for a mythic unique.

1584
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:36,000
All right, I believe that is actually everything. Wow, that is so much new class content, new skills, new legendaries, new new everything. And I didn't even get to talk about some of our other, you know, more regular class balance changes, updates to existing skills and legendaries.

1585
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:46,000
So make sure you definitely check out the patch notes. There is still more changes that come, but we're already really deep into this camp fresh at and we didn't want to extend it too, too much longer.

1586
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,000
So make sure you check out the patch notes for all the details on those other changes coming as well.

1587
01:51:50,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Yeah, thank you so much, Charles. I know we have gone through a lot of information work in our 1.5 of this campfire check. As I said, and I mentioned on social like this is going to be a very beefy campfire chat.

1588
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:15,000
We still have two more things that we do want to really cover off. And as Charles had mentioned, there are a lot of other class changes that we didn't actually fit within the presentation like a lot of balance specific items.

1589
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:23,000
So that will be on patch notes and patch notes will be available on our blog for BTR immediately after the stream. So please check that out.

1590
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:32,000
We are going to jump into some quality of life items. And so Colin, you want to take us through some quick quality of life items. I'll be coming with 2.0.

1591
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Yeah, I'll go quick so we can get to the super exciting cool thing.

1592
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Yeah, so the first one here is you can now select your preferred town portal location. So how that's going to work is you're going to open up the map and hover over any of the waypoints and when you right click on it.

1593
01:52:48,000 --> 01:53:00,000
It's going to set that as essentially your preferred location and whenever you town portal, it's going to take you there. So this is really helpful for when you're doing whispers, for example, you just set the tree of whispers is your preferred location.

1594
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Do some whispers when you press T you go right there. You don't have to open up the map. Then click on the waypoint and click on accept like it's all very seamless and it's just removing a lot of the inputs that you have to do to get back to town quickly.

1595
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:26,000
The next thing here is we're adding a dungeon key inventory tab for things like nightmare sigils. So that just gives you more space for more activities. So much room for activities.

1596
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:44,000
The next one here is we've done a pretty substantial rework of monster CC and this is in the spirit of we want to have really clear sort of delineations between normal monsters and elite monsters and we didn't like how often you're getting slowed down and how mandatory unstoppable can feel.

1597
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:58,000
So you know, I always felt bad to be fighting this huge horde of enemies and you see this elite and you're paying attention to the elite and then like this go man, mallard comes up and like sneak attacks you and knocks you down for three seconds and that's the thing that kills you that always felt like bullshit.

1598
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:16,000
So what we've done is we've sort of overhauled a lot of the normal monster CCs to be quick and snappy like you still feel them you kind of want to avoid them still. But they're much less sort of the reason why you die entirely. So the vampire in pale one like the two hander like comes and stabs you and stuns you for three seconds.

1599
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Let's turn it into an immobilized you can't move but you can just smack them in the face and then the werewolf leap is another great example where previously they come out of stealth and like leap attack on you and you get dazed and you'd walk around confused and now they just does it does a quick knockback.

1600
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:44,000
This next change here is small but I think it's a blaster's delight which is all the monsters that had really long death animations all die instantly. You know, after wait for the loop to hit the ground it's very satisfying.

1601
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:56,000
You know, the big S like spider hosts that crawl towards you when you kill them they pop instantly and all the spiders go and hit the walls and it feels great. The zombies feel really good too. Like they pop instantly when you kill them.

1602
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I mean, it's a very satisfying experience. So this should speed up combat quite a bit and it just feels really good.

1603
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:14,000
The next thing here is there are socketable inventory tab another tab for you for you to put socketables like gems and other socketables.

1604
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:23,000
And then there's also an additional stash tab that we're going to add. The next thing if we could roll the clip we took out just about all the dice.

1605
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:37,000
All would go up and then like click on the plunger and don't get hit by the spikes. That's all been replaced entirely with just monster packs of varying sizes and it's just way more seamless.

1606
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:44,000
In this case, we only rolled some normal monsters but sometimes it's a couple of elite packs. You never really know what you're going to get. It's like a Easter or a kinder egg I should say.

1607
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:49,000
And it just helps the dungeon flow substantially like to just sort of blast through those things.

1608
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And then a handful of dungeons have had their procedural logic updated just so there's more variation in the layouts. So when you play it, just going to roll out differently.

1609
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:04,000
This is really just iterating on our dungeon set to make them feel much more sort of flow inducing not slowing you down.

1610
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:09,000
And the next one here is minor but actually feels pretty good and it has a big impact on the game.

1611
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,000
When you get those paragon and level up notifications, we're actually going to tell you how many.

1612
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:20,000
So sometimes you'll realize, oh my god, I have like 15 skill points I can spend and it actually tells you the number.

1613
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
It's a nice quality of light change. So I think that's ever so.

1614
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Thank you Colin for running through quickly. I appreciate the efficiency of going through all the quality of life changes.

1615
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Now I know, Given has been very quiet over here. He's only chimed in a little bit.

1616
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:53,000
And we do want to talk about a new thing that is coming to vessel of hatred specifically for vessel of hatred players. So Given, will you talk us through it a little bit?

1617
01:56:53,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Yeah, so it's my privilege to kind of talk about a feature that the whole team's been working very hard on that we haven't really mentioned much.

1618
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:13,000
You know, we looked at the expansion. We had all these cool things, you know, torments, new class skills, spirit born, but we thought there was a whole.

1619
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:21,000
And we wanted to particularly give build crafters a new way to play for vessel of hatred.

1620
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:30,000
This is for folks who like me whose dream cooking show has nothing to do with British baking, but instead would be called Collins kitchen.

1621
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I'm a quick chat if you would binge Collins kitchen.

1622
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:46,000
So yeah, let's say I think some of you already kind of have an idea.

1623
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:55,000
So yeah, let's let's get into it. Some of you already know we're going to be talking about room words.

1624
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:06,000
So let's start with a little background. So room words were in Diablo 2 and they were a very powerful way of augmenting gear with socketable content.

1625
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,000
And there's a lot of good sort of nostalgic feelings. They were popular. They were remembered fondly.

1626
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,000
You can look on the right. That's one of the most iconic examples from Diablo 2.

1627
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:28,000
The name is enigma and you would make it with runes, ja, if burr, and it would get you some really cool skills that would come out of it when you put it all together.

1628
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:39,000
And for Diablo 4, we wanted to retain the soul of what Diablo 2 room words did, which is combining socketable components and creating more powerful items.

1629
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:55,000
But we also wanted to do something that felt appropriately fresh and new. And we wanted to lean into what's unique about the modern game to make the Diablo 4 version of room words and make it stand on its own and really feel like the right version to be giving to players.

1630
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Yeah, and what was awesome about Diablo 2 room words right was you got the set of rooms that made a god item right and it broke the rules like being able to teleport on other classes like what the hell bar bearing is teleporting across the screen.

1631
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:21,000
We really wanted to embrace that in a way that extended builds and didn't necessarily enforce you must play with this item. And we're really excited to share what that's sort of manifested right.

1632
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Yeah, and you all have a lot of builds that you started with from the base game and we want to add on to those.

1633
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:40,000
So, what are rune words? They're a way for you to make your own spells. So there are two types of rooms. There's runes of ritual and they specify actions from the player that they have to trigger.

1634
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:49,000
So you can see the example here of the yule room, which is a legendary quality room ritual. You have to cast a skill which has a cooldown. So you know frost over something like that.

1635
01:59:49,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Then you have runes of invocation and these grant powerful effects as a result of satisfying those runes of ritual. So the example here the gar room gives you two and a half percent critical strike chance for five seconds and you can stack up to 10 times to 25% and you can mix and match these.

1636
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:12,000
There'll be a lot of different runes of ritual and runes of invocation and you can put them together as you see fit.

1637
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:21,000
So when you combine a rune of ritual and rune of invocation, you pair them together, you put them in an item with two sockets, boom, you form a rune word.

1638
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And as you can tell, there's going to be rarity. We're going to have magic, rare and legendary and the higher rarity runes will have more potent conditions or effects.

1639
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:46,000
So one of the important elements of this is called offering, which is the rune resource system. So your runes of ritual will generate offering and they're meant to feed into their linked runes of invocation so that they can consume that offering.

1640
02:00:46,000 --> 02:01:00,000
And the sort of more demanding rituals that we would ask of you as a player, gain you more offering. At the same time, the more powerful invocations that you would try to get require more offering. And so there's sort of a sort of like shared economy there.

1641
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:09,000
So if you can look at these runes on the right, you get 50 offering for casting a skill with the cooldown and this rune only requires 25 offering for it to trigger.

1642
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:26,000
That's where overflow comes in. Overflow is when an invocation receives an offering in excess of what's needed to trigger it. But put more simply, we want you to have a mix and match system, but we want the pieces to be not super hard that they can't fit together easily when they have some rough edges.

1643
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:36,000
So many invocations can get different bonus effects when overflowed. Some of them might get increased radius to the effect. Some of them might get increased duration, but it'll always be proportional to the overflow amount.

1644
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:51,000
So as an example here, the gar root only requires 25 offering and it's getting double that, which is 50 from the old rune. So every time you cast a skill with a cooldown, you'll get two stacks of 2.5% critical strike chance or 5% crit strike.

1645
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
And so that's kind of how you get to play with the system and you get to optimize it in different ways.

1646
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:14,000
And it creates a lot of flexibility, right, even like if you do a really demanding ritual trigger, for example, on a really low offering rune of invocation, it's almost a way to start scaling that rune of invocation in a completely different way beyond just triggering the rune.

1647
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Exactly. Yeah, let's us as developers be more flexible in creating wide ranges of effects, you know, sort of small ones, big ones, and also the same for the rituals. And you get to kind of decide which ones you think fit your bill. There are cool.

1648
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:36,000
And we do our best to make sure that you can almost cook up anything.

1649
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:41,000
So if you rules, ruins can be socketed to items with two sockets.

1650
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:52,000
We've added a new another item to get two sockets for vessel of hatred. So you'll have your helm, your two hander, your gloves, and sorry, your helm, two hander, pants and chest.

1651
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:58,000
They can only be paired with a rune of the opposite type. So you have to pair a rune of ritual with a rune of invocation.

1652
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:07,000
You can have a maximum of two rune words equipped. You can't equip the same rune twice. And they're available for users who own vessel of hatred.

1653
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,000
They stack in your inventory in the new socketable inventory tab, which will also have your gents.

1654
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:20,000
And ruins are tradable between other players who own vessel of hatred.

1655
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:29,000
And they unlock with a quest in the campaign, both ruins dropping from as loot, but also ruin craft thing, which we'll get into later.

1656
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:34,000
And they drop at a higher rate in the under city, which is a specific place you can farm them.

1657
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So now let's get into some clips here. We get to actually see it in action.

1658
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:45,000
So this is the barbarian. And the rune of ritual they have is travel five meters, very simple.

1659
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:52,000
And they're going to join that to the earthquake, which is a legendary aspect that you've already seen before, which requires a hundred offering.

1660
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
So you see we'll put them together in this item.

1661
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,000
And then all they have to do is just run around.

1662
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Boom, earthquake dropping and saying what the paragon legendary glyph we just talked about.

1663
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Yeah, the earthquake train is leaving the station.

1664
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,000
What I love about this is it doesn't it doesn't just count your normal walking, right?

1665
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:20,000
If you're leaping, if you're charging, that's all counting towards like the distance that you're moving, right?

1666
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Oh, whoa. And you can see it here in like the world with for instance, like it's obviously spawning earthquakes.

1667
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Is that a druid petrified ultimate? This is supposed to be the wrong clip.

1668
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:35,000
All right, sorry guys, you know, we're doing it live. Let's just move on to the next one.

1669
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Okay, so we have a necromancer here with the root of ritual cast a non channel core skill getting 25 each.

1670
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:47,000
And then this is a classic from D2 gain plus three to all skills.

1671
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:55,000
So you'll get to see this necker has got five five skill ranks for leap and sever.

1672
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:02,000
They're going to go out and catch more socketable hard liquid for us. Pretty good.

1673
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:16,000
So a little pew pew is doing your basic core skill usage, filling up the offering needed.

1674
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Yeah, I really like the little tracking buff that that fills up as you as you're going to.

1675
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,000
So you don't need to really micromanage this. You can just add a glance. See that. Hey, I just filled it up.

1676
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
And now I get plus three ranks of sever.

1677
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Yep. And I hear a plus three. There you go.

1678
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
What was that?

1679
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:35,000
So yeah, this this neck rose just cooking and.

1680
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Oh, what is this another another broken clipped and we just cast teleport. What what?

1681
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Okay, I think you're all part of neck rose.

1682
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
What are you cooking over there, Jeevan?

1683
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Yeah, I'll stop making jokes mostly.

1684
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Yeah, so what we really wanted to lean into with D2 room words among other things was the ability to cast other classes skills and use their power and harness it into your build.

1685
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,000
So with room words, you're going to get to do that.

1686
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Each class is going to share two skills and one legendary aspect like the earthquake one that you saw.

1687
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,000
And some of them are even going to get get to cast improved versions.

1688
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:24,000
So for instance, you know, instead of the standard decrepify from the necker mentor, you get to cast hard decrepify, which is the upgraded version.

1689
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
And that's kind of we did that for a lot of reasons.

1690
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,000
You know, we wanted to make some of them feel a little better and a little more powerful and a lot of it is about balance.

1691
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:39,000
But one important thing that I always want to highlight here is that you always cast the best version of the skill.

1692
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,000
If you have upgrades as the sort of home owner of the class, right?

1693
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,000
So what that means is let's say you're a spirit born and you equip the cry room, which is the vortex spell.

1694
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:54,000
If you have points into the upgrade, then you'll cast the upgraded vortex when the room goes off.

1695
02:06:54,000 --> 02:07:00,000
So I don't think there'll be any class envy, you know, like everyone will get the best version of their own skills.

1696
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
And then they'll get to use other classes skills.

1697
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And we're really excited to see how people can construct new builds and new archetypes and what they can do with using the power of the classes.

1698
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:16,000
And that says enhanced war cry. So that means neckros can become berserk, right?

1699
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,000
That indeed does mean that.

1700
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:28,000
And I mean, enhanced war cries of winter, I got to say, that one's real strong. We've already seen people just chopping up the pit with that one.

1701
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Absolutely. Really looking forward to what kind of interesting new combinations and builds you can come up with by by dipping into other class skills in unique ways.

1702
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:45,000
It really just like multiplies the possibilities of what you can do with any given class.

1703
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Yeah, exactly. And not only do we want you to augment your builds with other classes skills, but you know, runes will scale with gear.

1704
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:58,000
So when you get more interesting runes of rituals, you'll find ways to optimize them as well and get more output.

1705
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
So we really feel like people will have a lot of theory crafting that they can build off of the room or system.

1706
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
And I'm very excited to see how you break the game.

1707
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:09,000
But that's what she do. She's doing PTR for me. Just break the game. See every build you can find that.

1708
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I totally destroy everything.

1709
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
So now we have the crafting element.

1710
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:18,000
So using three of the same room, you can use them to roll a new room.

1711
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,000
You go to the jeweler. It might not be the jeweler, but we'll see.

1712
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:29,000
And you will combine three of the same exact room and you'll get a new room out that is guaranteed to be different than the room you put in.

1713
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:32,000
And there's a chance to uproll it to the next highest rarity.

1714
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,000
So if you put three magic runes in, there's a chance that it'll be a rare room, same with same with rare.

1715
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,000
There's a chance that it'll be a legendary room.

1716
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
And then on top of that, we'll have the ability to craft mythic uniques.

1717
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:51,000
So you can use runes. Each mythic unique can be crafted with a specific set of runes.

1718
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
You'll need a legendary rare and magic runes of a certain quantity.

1719
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
And one, resplendent support.

1720
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
And this is in addition to the existing mythic unique crafting flow.

1721
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
So, um, yeah.

1722
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:09,000
I was just going to say this really hardens back to the sort of crafting that was so core in D2.

1723
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:12,000
And with the runes of being able to match three and get the next upgrade.

1724
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
But in a way, that's a little bit more flexible and gives you more progression out of it.

1725
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
And this is all tradable, right?

1726
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
So that match three, those crafting mythic uniques.

1727
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
What do you think that's going to do with trading?

1728
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to really build a sort of player community around how to acquire the runes you need.

1729
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Whether it's because you want to combine, you know, you have two and you want to find that third one to combine for a new one.

1730
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Or you're hunting for a specific mythic unique.

1731
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I think we're going to have a lot of player interaction.

1732
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Well, someone's going to win the capitalism game there. So we'll see how that goes.

1733
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I really like how the rune crafting system makes it so you're kind of always progressing.

1734
02:09:53,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Right? If you're getting room drops, then you're getting materials that you know can use to progress towards higher rarity runes.

1735
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
And potentially towards these mythic unique items.

1736
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Unlike, you know, some of the other loot drops, you know, if you don't find a good piece of gear, it just ends up being salvage.

1737
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Here with runes, you're kind of constantly getting some of that progression, even if it's not always the perfect room right now.

1738
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Yeah, I think that's something that we did talk to a lot of sort of D2 diehards when we built rune words.

1739
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
And one of the things that most of them tend to mention consistently was like every rune drop is progress, right?

1740
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:38,000
So we're moving up that ladder. And so we wanted to make sure that even if you didn't get the exact thing you wanted, it still meant something to you one way or another.

1741
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Well, I know we have we've talked a lot about a lot of stuff today. We had a progression, itemization, we talked about quality of life, we talked about class changes.

1742
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:57,000
And of course, the newest thing, which is rune words, which will be in vessel of hatred. But the one thing we did want to quickly talk about was PTR.

1743
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:04,000
PTR is coming up. And we want to give a little bit or at least some specifics on what that PTR test is going to be.

1744
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:13,000
And also hear from the team on exactly like what they're looking for from you guys out there that are playing like for feedback as you guys play through the systems.

1745
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:26,000
And so the thing that we've actually talked about today is going to be present in this PTR. So all the class balance changes, the progression changes, rune words will also be part of the PTR.

1746
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:34,000
So we actually do want players jumping in and checking it out. So let's jump right into some of the PTR items.

1747
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:49,000
So one knows PTR from even the last PTR that we have will carry over content from your main accounts. So if you've already done all your renown clear your fog of war, your alter will status will carry over onto your PTR account.

1748
02:11:49,000 --> 02:12:04,000
We did do a character copy as well. It was a while back though. So there, there, you may find that it might be a little dated from like the character copy that you have on live, but that will exist for players to actually use.

1749
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:11,000
One thing I will note is that we are planning on having two different testing phases for PTR specifically.

1750
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:34,000
The first testing phase will actually begin next Wednesday and will run through Friday about midday where we're going to actually give players the opportunity of kind of just starting characters from fresh because we really need people to try out the new progression systems that Colin and Aslan were talking about specifically in the beginning of the stream.

1751
02:12:34,000 --> 02:13:02,000
So Wednesday through midday Friday, we really need players to jump in, check that out, give us feedback specifically regarding anything tied to the new progression systems around midday on Friday though, we will be turning on the rest of the PTR, which will include things like rune words and all the other features that we were kind of talking about are well, all the other features will be part of it, but rune words and things like that will be turning in on Friday.

1752
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:11,000
One thing that we've heard from feedback from players specifically, especially as we have addressed this in the past, is that there is going to be a boost vendor available for this PTR.

1753
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:22,000
So in Kyiv, the shot players will be able to go and visit this specific vendor. This is the best video that I was talking about because it's small and it's dancing and looks absolutely amazing.

1754
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:35,000
This vendor will be available and you'll be able to interact with it and this vendor will actually then be able to provide you a ton of enhancements to your character, which we do have a list of here.

1755
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:46,000
So you will be able to boost your character up to level 50, level 60, of course, which is the new level cap after vessel of hatred and actionships.

1756
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:54,000
We will end up clearing out your whole map, your waypoints, fog of war. We will do your class mechanics stuff and have that already unlocked.

1757
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:05,000
All torment tiers will be unlocked, your postions will be upgraded completely. And then I know based off of feedback that we got from like the last PTR was, hey, it'd be great if we could generate like legendary items.

1758
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:15,000
If we can get all the unique items, all the runes that are well, that's new now, but all the runes and everything like that, including master working materials, that will actually be available.

1759
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:26,000
In this vendor, so this is a way for players to be more efficient, well, testing and being able to give us more feedback, especially around and game related items.

1760
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:38,000
So we really need players to jump in for PTR. One last caveat I do want to mention is, infernal hordes will not be available in this specific PTR.

1761
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:46,000
We are still doing some work on that right now before we actually get it ready, but all the other features within the game will be available.

1762
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Infernal hordes, as I mentioned, will be, it's a permanent feature, so it's coming back to the game no matter what.

1763
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:59,000
And then separately, I do want to remind everyone that PTR right now is still just PC battle net only.

1764
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:12,000
This does give us the flexibility being able to upload change things on the fly, like things like turning turning room words on on Friday, for instances, gives us, we have the flexibility being able to do that on on our own platform.

1765
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:25,000
So it's just easier for us to be able to have that additional work from our side to be able to make things like that happen when we can do testing specifically from that end.

1766
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:39,000
But Colin, Aslan, I'd be really curious to hear like what you guys are looking for specifically in this PTR from feedback from players that they can focus in on and provide feedback on as they go into the test.

1767
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Yeah, so I think we really want to see people focusing on the new journey.

1768
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:51,000
So starting from level one and feeling out what difficulty tier is right for you.

1769
02:15:51,000 --> 02:16:10,000
And if that feels like it's the difficulty tier that you would expect to be on based on how powerful you've managed to make your character and how many of the progression systems you've engaged with, like, if you engage with tempering and you go all out and you, you know, like, you're like, I'm going to make my character a blaster, even though they're only level 30.

1770
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:18,000
How far can you go with that and are you going as far as you expected you would be able to go?

1771
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Yeah, those are great points. It really is about, you know, are we hitting that expectation that we've sort of created, right?

1772
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Which is we really loved how the mind cage was functioning. We loved how tormented bosses felt in terms of having hard mode versions of things.

1773
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Are these difficulty tier sort of meeting those expectations of all the things that we have had in the previous game now mapped to a more streamlined system that should be much, much easier to navigate?

1774
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Awesome. And I know on the class side, like Charles, would you kind of looking for what's the team looking for in that front?

1775
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Yeah, I think we're really looking at the new skills and the new key passives for each class and how they're usable at all points in your character journey, right?

1776
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:12,000
They should feel good to press when you just first learn these new skills, but they should also feel really good when you're in the late game and you're trying to, you know, make a build all around them, right?

1777
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Around your stoneburst, like, does it feel like that has enough support and that you can, you know, make a stoneburst build or dense of knives and, or all the other different skills, like, do they fit in?

1778
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:35,000
What's their appropriate power level and real, really want to make sure that the new skills and the new key passives enabled new ways of playing our classes and that they feel satisfying to build that way.

1779
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Awesome. And, Jeevan, I know you mentioned to everyone, break the game with RuneWord. So, is there any, maybe any more extra items you're looking for in terms of feedback?

1780
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Yeah, I mean, it's definitely mostly about that. I want to see what people come up with. I want to see, you know, what you can cook in terms of build, you can do something fun or cool or unexpected.

1781
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:09,000
And also, you know, I'm highly interested in this sort of balance feedback. I think we'll get it from all of you, but we've had a lot of people on the teamwork very hard on conceptualizing and making sure this stuff is right on the edge of broken without actually being broken.

1782
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:14,000
And you'll get to prove me, brawl, if that isn't the case.

1783
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Awesome. Well, I know we do want to jump into a little bit of Q&A before we kind of wrap up. I know we've been here for a little while, so we'll try to grab some questions specifically from Twitch chat.

1784
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I know the probably the most popular question right now from the community is about Armory, and I do want to start off with that specifically.

1785
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:51,000
And I do also want to just confirm that we are working on an Armory. It is it that the team is cooking on it right now. We just don't have it ready immediately.

1786
02:18:51,000 --> 02:19:16,000
But soon as we have an update, we will be providing that to the community. There is work for an Armory happening. We're not purposely ignoring it. I promise you, and it is in the work specifically from that. And so I know we have questions from Twitch chat. So this is where I actually like butcher everyone's name. So in standard fashion, I will continue to do that.

1787
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:23,000
It's just a little different now because I actually like have a screen in front of me, which is actually really really beneficial.

1788
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:38,000
But I guess we'll start off with a question regarding the different difficulty tiers. So this from double DHZ, which is since we now have eight difficulties, does this mean with power increase in later seasons, more difficulties will be added.

1789
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Are we planning on adding like 20 difficulties like in Diablo 3, like what's the plans around that?

1790
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Yeah, we want to be really measured in terms of when we add difficulty tiers. I think it sets us up for adding them when we feel like it's an appropriate time.

1791
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:07,000
We don't want to get to a spot where we have 20 different difficulties here. We want to have just enough granularity to support the amount of power that we're adding.

1792
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:17,000
And what we don't want to do is sort of say, okay, we're going to add things like rune words or add things like seasonal powers and then nerf all of you by making the monsters 100% tankier to compensate for the power.

1793
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:25,000
We'd actually rather create a system that when you get that new power, we're going to add another band of difficulty to get even more efficiency out of that power.

1794
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:34,000
So that's been the sort of guiding light is we don't want to continue to sort of nerf players into a spot where they can sort of use all this new power to push.

1795
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:40,000
A great example of that is previously in seasons we would actually increase monster health to compensate for some of the seasonal powers.

1796
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Now if you get seasonal powers, if you're blasting penitent and leveling to 60 faster, good for you.

1797
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Like that's something that we think is actually really important to the system.

1798
02:20:53,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Awesome. I know next question that we have this is a question I've seen a decent amount. This is from explosive cat. Hopefully your cat is not exploiting.

1799
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:09,000
What's the purpose of nightmare dungeons now that lists have moved out of pit?

1800
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Yeah, so nightmare dungeons are going to be where you receive your master working materials.

1801
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:32,000
And because nightmare dungeons are going to be following the difficulty tier system now, you're going to be able to go into higher torment tiers or rather higher difficulty tier nightmare dungeons and get more master materials out of that.

1802
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:43,000
So just like all other kinds of content in the game now, being able to go into a higher difficulty of that activity is going to ultimately be better for you.

1803
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:56,000
The grind sort of putting a grind currency actually fits much better in a nightmare dungeon compared to the pit because it means that every sort of elite you kill, every chest you open or every corner you go into and you find an elite pack.

1804
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Those are going to be master working materials as opposed to today where it's like well, the instant I make a turn that is not in the direction of finishing this dungeon has been a waste of my time because I want that cliff that can play completely changes when everything in the dungeon is dropping master working materials.

1805
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:23,000
And we think that feels so much better for that type of content conversely, you know, with the pit, you know, again, we're going to reward you for pushing difficulty and we do want to sort of get there quickly and get that reward and get out.

1806
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
So we think that'll feel a lot better.

1807
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Yeah, so just just for people because I think when they made me heard like well, now it's just moved to nightmare dungeons and it's just at the end.

1808
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:46,000
It's actually part of the whole nightmare dungeon. It's not just the end goal getting to the end and getting you know master working materials there just want to clarify for a chat because I know it really.

1809
02:22:46,000 --> 02:23:00,000
There's a good amount of the end when you fill the boss right of course the boss has to have good shit, but like what's really going to feel great is like when you run into a massive elite pack like you just randomly run into, you know, we've responds maybe too many.

1810
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Those are all going to represent you know little backs of master working materials, which is going to be huge.

1811
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Awesome. This question is from Rxc 105 our ruins reusable.

1812
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Yeah, so I just want to say chat I've been reading I've been reading Twitch chat and what you said has struck a chord.

1813
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Anyway, yes, they will be.

1814
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Can't take you anywhere.

1815
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:39,000
You could unsocket ruins and you can move them into different items. Yes, absolutely.

1816
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I saw a few related questions to that. They don't get to exist in the same item as gems. You do have to pick between gems and ruins on the individual item.

1817
02:23:53,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Awesome. I know there was a question related to another well at least I don't know I don't know Charles.

1818
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:09,000
You want to answer this or if you have additional details. There's a lot of questions related to one of the mythic unique.

1819
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:15,000
It's a additive damage to demons and angels specifically.

1820
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I don't know if you like talk about I will confirm that is the wording on the effect plus damage to angels and demons.

1821
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:30,000
There you go guys. We'll just leave it at that.

1822
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:44,000
No further comment on that additional question that we have related to a paragon is why capped the amount of boards and instead of just capping maybe the amount of glyphs we can use.

1823
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,000
This is from hot.

1824
02:24:47,000 --> 02:25:10,000
That's a really good point. Something that I think we can take back and really think about we had discussed and we felt like the cleanest solution from the flow perspective was that we wanted to just make it really compact and make those choices about which glyphs and which legendary nodes and eventually what rare and magic nodes matter to you.

1825
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:16,000
That's really good feedback and something we can continue to monitor as we go into PTR and as people get their hands on it.

1826
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Again, it's really about making those boards more punchy and the connections between those boards is something that you navigate during your journey.

1827
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:29,000
But the sort of end point is about making those really chunky choices on what glyphs you want and what legendary nodes you want.

1828
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:38,000
And we think that ultimately, especially now that paragon is run wide and all your allts, I think we touched on that earlier, all your allts get to benefit from this.

1829
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:46,000
It's really going to streamline that process of getting your points locked in quickly on those alt characters and get them into the end game really quickly.

1830
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:51,000
So that's a really good point of feedback.

1831
02:25:51,000 --> 02:26:02,000
I have a question from WTF, Akalakal, whatever, and I say this is bad.

1832
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Yeah, you get the point. Well, everyone need to be in Kyovashod to change difficulty like it is currently.

1833
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:20,000
That's a good question. We've added actually. Yeah, so you could imagine how obnoxious it would be to do the pit and care car and then have to go to Kyovashod to then unlock the new torrent.

1834
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Here that you just got so we actually added difficulty tier selectors in carigar as well as Kyovashod in addition to Kyovashod.

1835
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:37,000
And then we also have one in Corrast and there's also another one I think near the dark citadel entrance.

1836
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:45,000
We've added them in a few locations across the game just make a little bit of a better experience.

1837
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:51,000
A question from a few people there's like Corrinter, there's another question from nine tons of pain.

1838
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Our list kind of shared between all characters in the realm or do they have to be leveled up separately?

1839
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:08,000
So those are still leveled up separately, but the something like going forward we definitely want to emphasis on like making alt more seamless to play into and we definitely.

1840
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:17,000
There's some underlying feedback there which is wouldn't it be great if the Paragon lists for account wide and it's like yeah that's something we can take back to the team and philosophically.

1841
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:25,000
You know we really want to start moving towards a direction where making alt is really easy to get into and and feel powerful.

1842
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,000
So that's something we can definitely take note of.

1843
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:35,000
And also highlight that right the because the Paragon points are shared account wide or realm wide as it were.

1844
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:51,000
If you make a new character you're going to get a ton of Paragon points right away which increases your power level which may be means you think on a higher pit tier and then you get the catch up mechanic on level enough those clips so it is a little bit easier for you're also level up those clips as well even if it's not 100% shared.

1845
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Yeah that's very true you can level up you can level them up really fast in the pit if you're pushing deep.

1846
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:24,000
There is a question regarding eternal realm characters like and what happens to them when 2.0 kind of launches what's the like do I'm assuming because they already have like 925 gear if they're at max level they'll be brought down to that to that new eye level that we have mentioned is there like any specific changes or anything or is it kind of laid out exactly kind of how we presented.

1847
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Oh I can answer this yeah yeah so we are doing some adjustments to for those eternal players who really like to play the game on one character we wanted to make sure that there is new loot to chase we also just needed to make sure that with the new character level adjustments you know we sort of had to adjust the eye power of items now that the fact that the max character level is 60.

1848
02:28:53,000 --> 02:29:02,000
In addition to our goals of really sort of creating more grounded numbers it does mean level 50 is getting an eye power adjustment as well as the affixes are being adjusted.

1849
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:11,000
But we are going to max roll every single affix that we adjusted power wise so for example if you get a fight we're going to take those items and adjust them.

1850
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:22,000
We aren't going to re-roll those affix bands like if you had perfect affixes we're just going to essentially max roll all of them within that band so there's no feels bad about you know I had this perfect item and you ruined it by re-rolling it.

1851
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:40,000
But the sort of main takeaway there is we wanted to make sure in patch 2.0 that there was new loot to chase you know we wanted to make sure that the new unique how to place to sing and that that's all sort of in service to that for that type of eternal player who really likes that sort of long form progression.

1852
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Awesome question from ice panther room words are they applicable to all items and weapons or they restrict to specific types of equipment.

1853
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Additionally can gems be inserted into equipment with rooms.

1854
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Yeah on there they can be inserted into all types of equipment so they're not restricted from being in unique as long as you know you have two sockets for that unique and the to restate the slots that are available with the same type of equipment.

1855
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:19,000
That are available with two sockets used it on base game it's three it's a chess pants and two hander we're also adding a second socket to home so you have four slots.

1856
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:30,000
And you cannot mix ruins with gems in any item and you wouldn't want to you basically be losing the benefit of them.

1857
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:49,000
I know we have some questions related to like some co up bugs I will say that I've gone on I know like forums and red and addressed at least address them that we are working on them I can tell you the team is most definitely working on them right now excuse me as I call.

1858
02:30:49,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Still getting over my my sickness i'm and then I know this is actually pretty I'm gonna ask this is a funny question it either runs for G and then bun.

1859
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:31,000
I mean my narcissism certainly would have let me do that but I think I think we can't we can't we can't do that sort of stuff unfortunately I would love to but I will say there are you know the the ruins have these sort of phrases that they unlock when you actually compose the spells and we have some I think fun references and easter eggs to you know the great the oblong games of the past and so hopefully that'll kind of make you smile and see.

1860
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Awesome and then ruins are they stackable.

1861
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Yeah they are stackable and we we have added a new tab for them as well we have a socketable tab so the room all your rooms and gems will go there.

1862
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:56,000
So there we go you know pretty pretty good for your inventory yeah that it that would have been really messing with inventory of friends do not stack and now that the up.

1863
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Yeah and now the other on top which is really really good so cool I know we are going we are very over on time so I do want to I do want to make sure that we let everyone go here so that they can eat because we've now gone well past lunch over here in California.

1864
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:28,000
So just a reminder for everyone that a PTR is actually can be starting next Wednesday we will have patch notes and the blog up immediately after the stream specifically here so you guys can.

Check it out check out the patch notes it's 17,000 words a lot of words so I apologize I will say that for other locales it might be until like early next week before those patch notes will be available.

02:32:41,000 --> 02:33:10,000
It just takes a while for us to localize and some of those and it kind of came in a little hot so we do plan on actually having that available in all languages just for now they will be English only and immediately after this specific stream again PTR starts next Wednesday we'll have two different phases Wednesday through Friday will be that first initial phase where we players jumping in checking out the progression changes and testing all that out and then starting on Friday for the the rest of the week specifically.

1867
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:23,000
We'll end up having the boost vendor available where players can actually jump in and you know test out everything that they need to regarding room words and all other things that are tied to end game.
