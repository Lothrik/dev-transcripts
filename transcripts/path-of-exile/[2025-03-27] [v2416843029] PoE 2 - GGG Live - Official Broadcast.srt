00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, I'm Jonathan Rogers, Game Director on Path of Exile 2.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to GGG Live.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, it's been a little over three months since we launched Early Access,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so it's about time for our first major content update.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we're going to show you an exclusive reveal of Path of Exile 2, Dawn of the Hunt,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which launches on April 4th.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Twitch drops are enabled on today's livestream,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so make sure you follow the instructions below

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
in order to claim your Executioner's Guillotine Finisher effect.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now in today's stream, we're going to take you on a deep dive into the new Dawn of the Hunt update.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We'll cover a new class, five new Ascendancy classes,

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and huge expansions on character systems like unique items and support gems.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
After that, it's on to the endgame improvements,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
including changes to systems, a bunch of new encounters, and lots of other content.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're going to finish up today with a live Q&A session

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
where Ziggy D will ask Path of Exile 2's Game Directors, myself and Mark,

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
your questions from Twitch chat.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now we have a lot to cover today, so let's get started with a trailer for Path of Exile 2, Dawn of the Hunt.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We as Mary are guided by the Spirit.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It provides prey, shelter, even love.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But for me, one day, all that were changed.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The Spirit, it showed me something.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Something forbidden.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And to defend all I want, I used it.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I lost everything that day.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But fate won't finish with me yet.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll right the wrongs I've done.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll do what I must.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No matter the cost.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I will hear the Spirit once more.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
you later.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I know that...

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
... Mutual marksmanship.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Tell us more.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Soon, you'regriffin on if cells may raise.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There are ways of setting Jay in fakears.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Make me feel more.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Fail.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How fast?

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A huge choice?

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Fail.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Who doesn't come?

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
For now, we've fixed the ability.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Uh-oh, we're able to allow ourselves消 our cannons.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
They didn't want us to help transactions life,

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and we'll have obstfloor them emotionalikat'sнем然后 el Reynolds to candy.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't make me kill you!

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I shall make you your plan.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I shall make you your plan.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I shall make you your plan.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I shall make you your plan.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I shall make you your plan.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I shall make you your plan.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now as you can see, in Dawn of the Hunt we're introducing the first new class since early access to Peewee 2, the Huntress.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The Huntress is a spear wielding as merry warrior. Born into a society with strict traditions, she was exiled from her homeland after using the power of a skill gem to defend her village.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
As a dexterous spear user, she specializes in both melee and ranged combat, dashing into and out of battle.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Spears have extended range and a short dash, but unlike other melee weapons, you can also throw them.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In order to make a hybrid ranged and melee character work, we have to do a lot of thinking about ways to make it fun to both enter and exit melee range.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The first skill you will get as a Huntress is Whirling Slash.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
As well as striking in a circle around you, this skill creates a whirlwind that blinds your enemies.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Leaving the whirlwind will make it explode.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The more Whirling Slash is used, the bigger the whirlwind and the bigger the explosion.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Once you're out of there, you'll want to follow up with something ranged.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Whip your spear around to shoot twisters towards your foes.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
These twisters bounce off walls and can hit enemies multiple times.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can also throw twisters inside a whirlwind to shoot out extra tornadoes that do way more damage.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In her offhand, the Huntress will usually want to hold a Buckler, which allows you to do a new skill, Parry.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
While holding down Parry, your character will counterattack any incoming attack from monsters near you, stunning them.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
In addition, the monsters will take extra attack damage from your follow up strike.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Some specific skills are designed to be used after a parry and have extra effects.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Disengage is a skill that does a quick jump back, damaging enemies in front of you, and it can be used to interrupt other actions, like Dodgeroll.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If you use it against a parried enemy though, it causes an explosion and gives you a frenzy charge.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Just be careful. If you parry too much, you're going to get stunned and possibly killed.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You can combine this combo with Whirling Slash.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Slash, Parry, Disengage, and you'll get an explosion on the Disengage and the Whirling Slash.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The Huntress also has a variety of elemental spear throw attacks.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You could use Lightning Spear to bounce lightning between your foes.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Or you could throw Explosive Spears into the ground.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
These spears take a while to detonate, but when they do, they'll incinerate anyone caught in the blast.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All spear throws on the Huntress can also be empowered by frenzy charges.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
For example, Explosive Spears will do an even larger explosion and leave fire on the ground.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And these empowered versions can activate even more combos.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Using Whirling Slash over Ground Fire will suck it into the Whirlwind, adding fire to the explosion.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Using Twisters inside a Fire Whirlwind will shoot out fire tornadoes as well.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And you can do similar combos with Ice and Lightning too.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now a key aspect of hunting is exhausting your foes by causing blood loss.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This skill is Rake, which dashes towards your target and unleashes a deadly slash, opening up wounds on your enemies.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Follow up with Disengage and watch them bleed out as they run towards you.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
On the health bar of monsters you can see how much blood loss the enemy has experienced.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And the Huntress has skills to take advantage of this.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
For example, using Blood Hunt will thrust forward and cause a bloody explosion.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The more blood loss, the bigger the explosion.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If you want to cause bigger bleeds, try out Rapid Assault.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The final hit of this multi-hit combo will stick a spear into your enemy for a big bleed.

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Now Explosive Spear and Rapid Assault both result in leaving spears behind, either in the ground or in enemies.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But there are other skills that leave spears around too, like Storm Lance,

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
that leaves an electrical spear that arcs towards enemies.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But what can you do with all these spears?

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Dedonate them of course.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thunder Asleep will allow you to jump onto and explode any spears either in the ground or in your enemies.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now as well as hunting animals, the Huntress also has the ability to work with them.

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
While fighting any beast you have the ability to tame it and use it as a companion.

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can only have one companion at a time, but it will keep the mods that were on it.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Try to find a rare beast with good mods to take full advantage of your ability to tame them.

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now this is just the beginning of the Huntress.

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We've really tried to make the hybrid ranged and melee gameplay work for this class

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
by having a huge amount of synergy between ranged and melee options.

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There are 22 new skills available for the Huntress.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:26,000
By endgame you'll be slinging hundreds of insanely powerful spears, sending forth spirit animals and summoning the might of Solaris from the sky.

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But we still haven't talked about Ascendancy classes yet.

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What can the Huntress ascend into?

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, the first Ascension class you could choose is the Ritualist.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The Ritualist has embraced the darker side of his merry traditions by harnessing the power of animal sacrifice and plague.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The Corrupted Lifeforce skill causes all enemies around you to grow volatile blood boils on their skin.

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
When those enemies are slain the boils will burst, spreading corrupted blood to all enemies around them.

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The Ritualist also excels in taking advantage of magical trinkets.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The Unfurled Finger skill allows you to equip an additional ring on a finger around your neck.

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Taking Mystic Attunement increases the bonuses of all the rings and amulets you have equipped.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Now this is one of my favourites.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
As the Whispers Ask grants you a new skill, Ritual Sacrifice.

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Use the skill on the corpses of slain rare monsters to absorb the power in their blood to give you one of their modifiers for a short time.

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Specialise further into Ritualistic Sacrifice with As the Whispers Demand.

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Which allows you to perform that skill on yourself instead of a corpse.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Cut your own hand, sacrificing some of your own blood to empower yourself.

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The Amazon Ascension is for those looking to hunt more than just beasts.

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Trained as an elite guard to the most important as merry elders,

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the Amazon will use more traditional fighting techniques mastered to perfection.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The Predatory Instinct skill will cause you to reveal weaknesses in the defences of rare and unique enemies, causing you to deal more damage.

129
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can see those weak spots represented on their life bars.

130
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,000
While using Elemental Infusion, any charges you consume will infuse your weapon with elemental power, causing any projectile attacks to explode on impact.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The Critical Strike skill is as simple as it sounds.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It takes your excess accuracy and gives it to you as critical strike chance.

133
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Additionally, you have skills like Mystic Harvest, which allows your elemental damage to leech life.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And as Merry Brew, to be able to use either flask to restore both life and mana.

135
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So those are the two new ascendancies for the Huntress.

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But those are not the only ascendancies in Dawn of the Hunt.

137
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We've added a new Ascension class for three of the other, existing classes too.

138
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
First up for our warriors out there, we have the Smith of Catawba.

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The warrior is a blacksmith in origin, taught by his father, Renly.

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
With this ascension, you can take your smithing skills to new heights by embracing power from the insatiable one himself, Kitawa.

141
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Smiths of Catawba are master blacksmiths and have the ability to forge their weapon, quite literally.

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Using the Against the Anvil notable skill, you can enhance your weapon with fiery destruction before any battle.

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
After doing so, your attacks will release explosions on hit for maximum devastation.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can also use the power of Kitawa to summon an animated copy of your weapon to fight alongside you.

145
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
A great blacksmith can do more than just forging their weapon though.

146
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Their armour can be enhanced too.

147
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now you might think this ascendancy class tree looks a little… abnormal.

148
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And you're right.

149
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There's a lot of notable skills all disconnected at the bottom there.

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
By taking this point here, which is free to assign, your character is unable to equip body armours with mods of any kind.

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So your body armour must be normal.

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Sounds like a downside, right?

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Except now in true blacksmith fashion, you get to craft your own body armour by taking those disconnected notables with your points.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you want your body armour to grant life, take this notable.

155
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If you want resistances, take this one.

156
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There are so many choices.

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Think of it like you're crafting your own body armour, just in a more literal sense.

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Now, let's move on to those who prefer the reassuring feel of a crossbow in their hands, the Mercenary.

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Alongside the existing ascension classes, the Gemling Legionnaire and the Witch Hunter, you can now play as the Tactician.

160
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The Tactician is a former Blackguard elite.

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Free from the duties of a Blackguard, he is able to use his training to decimate the monsters of Wraeclast and earn a healthy income doing so.

162
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This training comes in the form of various skills, like Suppressing Fire, which causes all projectiles to pin enemies.

163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When combined with the Right Where We Want Them notable, your pin not only stops your enemies from moving, but stops them from performing actions too, similar to Freeze.

164
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
With a soldier's training, the Tactician also works well cooperatively.

165
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Using the Whoever Pays Best notable, you can place multiple banners at once.

166
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The Watch How We Do It skill gives a portion of your weapons damage to your allies as well.

167
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But if that isn't enough, you can also command your army of off-screen archers to unleash hell and carpet an entire area with Arabs.

168
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Finally, Witch players will be able to join their legions by becoming undead themselves.

169
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
In Dawn of the Hunt, we're introducing the Lich Ascension class.

170
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The Lich is a master of chaos and curses and could sacrifice her life to enhance her energy shield.

171
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The Crystalline Phylactery skill allows you to nominate a jewel in which to contain part of your soul, massively increasing its power.

172
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There's just one downside to splitting your soul this way though.

173
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you have no energy shield, your mana costs will shoot up.

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The Necromantic Conduit skill causes you and allies in your presence to have unholy might, granting extra damage as chaos damage.

175
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Rupture the Soul makes enemies you curse explode with chaos damage when slain.

176
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Rupture the Soul makes a curse.

177
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Dominion over Flesh allows you to apply an additional curse.

178
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's safe to say you'll be the true master of the Occult by choosing the Lich class.

179
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So Dawn of the Hunt has the Huntress and five new Ascension classes, but it doesn't end there.

180
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Let's take a look at some of the new skills we've added.

181
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Now you may remember what previously talked about the Raise Spectre skill.

182
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's finally complete and will be made available in the upcoming expansion.

183
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It can be found in the Occult skills on the Skill Gem Crafting panel.

184
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Raise Spectre is a skill that allows you to trap the soul of almost any monster in the game,

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
which you can then summon in the Skill Panel.

186
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Spectres cost Spirit and will revive automatically if they die, but the Spirit cost varies based on the power of the monster.

187
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You could summon an army of weaker monsters, or a few of the more powerful monsters.

188
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You can combine them with their existing skeleton minions, or summon exclusively Spectres.

189
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's all up to you and how you want to customise your army of the undead.

190
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Given that there are hundreds upon hundreds of monster variants in Path of Exile 2,

191
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
it's safe to say you'll be experimenting with this one for a while.

192
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We look forward to seeing which monsters serve you best.

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Now let's move on to our next skill.

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Since we've been talking about summoning undead so much,

195
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
let's have a change of pace and summon something a little more alive.

196
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
In Dawn of the Hunt we're adding the Summon Rower skill.

197
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Summon your friendly rower to aid you in combat as a minion.

198
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You can also mount your rower in combat at any time,

199
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
allowing you to move at full speed even while shooting arrows or throwing spears.

200
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Be wary though, if you take too much damage while riding your mount,

201
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you can be knocked off and get overwhelmed.

202
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's worth keeping an eye on your stagger bar,

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
as falling off the mount can mean almost certain death.

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
On the topic of new ways to enhance your character, let's talk about support gems.

205
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Support gems are used to modify your skill gems in meaningful and interesting ways.

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Currently we feel that a lot of builds have insufficient options here.

207
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
To alleviate this, we're adding over 100 new support gems.

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hema Crystals will enable a new kind of bleed build,

209
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
turning the damage over time you would have done into explosive vile crystals.

210
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Alignment is a support gem for bow attacks, which can reward skilled players with good positional skills.

211
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Cal-trops will allow you to litter the battlefield with hazards,

212
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
slowing your foes as you fling spears through their ranks.

213
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But there's plenty more for every playstyle, such as...

214
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Enormity.

215
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Unsteady tempo.

216
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Profanity.

217
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Unsteady tempo.

218
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Profanity.

219
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Retaliate.

220
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Syzygy.

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Profanity

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Retaliate

223
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Syzygy

224
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yep, that's a real word

225
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And many more

226
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Now we've talked about a new class

227
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
New ascendancy classes

228
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
New skills

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And new support gems

230
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But let's not forget about the core of a true action RPG

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The items

232
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
To start with, let's talk about uniques

233
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We're adding over 100 new unique items

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This time we've made sure to add uniques

235
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
With a focus on mid and endgame tiers

236
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
To make sure there are more exciting items to find

237
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
For higher level characters

238
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's look at some examples

239
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Embrace your inner devil with Chernobog's pillar

240
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It grants you a large amount of fire damage

241
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Based on your block chance

242
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The coming calamity allows you to become a true master of the elements

243
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Granting you all three elemental herald skills

244
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Without costing any spirit

245
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
At the same time it penalises enemy resistances

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Wastegate is a belt useful for builds

247
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Using a single resource like blood magic

248
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Or archmage builds

249
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
With this belt you can use two life flasks

250
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Or two mana flasks

251
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's up to you

252
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Now we could go through these all day

253
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But we'll leave most of them for you to discover

254
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Suffice to say though

255
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We want there to be way more cool things to find

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Over time our goal is to add a unique to every single base item type at a minimum

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So that you can chance any base in the game

258
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Now, given that we have the Huntress

259
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We have a set of unique spears from early game all the way through the end game as well

260
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
One example is Scyther's Spear

261
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Which combines bleed and fire in a powerful way

262
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It allows your ignites to be aggravated dealing substantially more damage

263
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We're also introducing a suite of unique bucklers

264
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
With some interesting parry mechanics

265
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Calgyra's Arc for example

266
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Allows you to parry projectiles from any distance

267
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And we're also adding our first unique charms

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Bayra's Anguish will not only protect you from ignite

269
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We'll also emit a devastating fire nova whenever you do get ignited

270
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
In sum, there's just a ton of new uniques to find

271
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We can't wait to see the weird and broken builds that come out of it

272
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Now we also want to talk about crafting options

273
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And each major update during early access

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Will be continuing to add and improve the options here

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We have various new crafting tools that have been added as rewards

276
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
To many of the different types of new content that we're adding

277
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But for now, I just want to mention the changes to runes

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Runes add commonly available mods

279
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But since they only have one tier

280
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Flat damage mods tend to get outclassed by endgame

281
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So we've changed runes to have multiple tiers

282
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Allowing you to get higher tier mods than before

283
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Our plan is to significantly expand the number of more specialised mods

284
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
For crafting using socketables as we add new content over time

285
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And the first new set of those comes from what we're talking about next

286
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
In Dawn of the Hunt we're adding Asmerian Wisps

287
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Which can be found throughout both the campaign and the endgame

288
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The Asmeri spirit has made itself present in Wraeclast

289
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And it appears to be trying to warn or maybe prepare us for the coming darkness

290
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You will first encounter a manifestation of it in the Grellwood in Act 1

291
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Where you'll meet Delwyn and Asmeri Hunter who is trying to find out what exactly is causing the spirit to behave this way

292
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
As you approach the wisp it will flee leading you past monsters

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Any monsters it comes into contact with are infused by it making them more powerful

294
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Each spirit is associated with a specific revered animal within Asmeri culture

295
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
This one is a wisp of the great bear and grants enemies extra life and stun

296
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The wisp moves faster the closer you are and as you move away they slow down to wait for you

297
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But if you get too far away for too long they'll dissipate and return to the woods

298
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
As you continue to chase the wisp it will find and possess a rare or unique monster

299
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Granting it a new powerful ability

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Because this was a wisp of the great bear this monster now also has increased life and stun

301
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But on top of that it will periodically summon a large spectral bear that slams with wild fury

302
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
If you are able to defeat this foe you will be rewarded

303
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
For each monster that was infused and killed along the way the rewards will be increased

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Each wisp has its own mechanics

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The wisp of the winter owl is a primal wisp that causes enemies to deal extra cold damage

306
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Gain energy shield and release wind vortices on death

307
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
When infusing a monster they will call down large tornadoes to protect their host

308
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The wisp of the wild cat is a vivid wisp that causes affected monsters to deal more critical strikes

309
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And become more evasive

310
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
When it infuses a monster it will summon a barrage of feline spirits that will attempt to tear you limb from limb

311
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If you're lucky you may even find sacred wisps that can do some pretty crazy things to the monsters they influence

312
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Like the wisp of the cunning fox which turns normal monsters into magics

313
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Magic monsters into rares

314
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And rare monsters into actual bosses

315
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Asmerian wisps can drop a new set of socketable items that allow you to craft a wide range of interesting new mods onto your items

316
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Each one may only be used on a specific item slot

317
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
As mentioned the Asmerian wisps can be encountered throughout the game

318
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But there's also a new endgame map called the Asmeri Rangers

319
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
A mountain village where the Asmeri once lived now overrun with corrupt monsters

320
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
This map always has multiple Asmerian wisps in it and familiar yet not quite the same boss fight

321
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Asmerian wisps can also be further modified by the endgame atlas tree as well

322
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And by tablets

323
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But I'm not going to be the one talking about those things

324
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
In order to cover all the new content in endgame I'm going to hand things over to Mark

325
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hi, I'm Mark Roberts, Game Director on Path of Exile 2

326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
There's a ton to talk about with the endgame today

327
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So let's dig right in

328
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Path of Exile 2's early access began with a brand new endgame

329
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And it was clear that it needed a lot of work

330
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
After absorbing your feedback

331
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We're ready to make some epic changes

332
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The first thing is

333
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We just need a lot more content

334
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
In Dawn of the Hunt

335
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
We have made sure to focus on increasing the sheer number of interesting

336
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And different encounters you will randomly stumble into

337
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
As you explore the endgame

338
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And the second goal is to smoothen the progression through maps

339
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And reduce the amount of annoying busywork

340
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
To start with

341
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Let's talk about the new interesting stuff to find

342
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Well, the most obvious thing to add are new maps

343
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
As well as the Asmeri ranges that Jonathan mentioned earlier

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Dawn of the Hunt also contains seven other new maps

345
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
All with their own custom encounters

346
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Let's start with this one

347
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The Feral Megalith's map

348
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Starts off in the wild Azamite forests

349
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
As you progress through the forest

350
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You will find mysterious rune carved stones

351
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That when touched surge with energy

352
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
After activating all the stones

353
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You can find a Grand Henge

354
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Where all the energy is coalescing

355
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You can then start an encounter

356
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The area darkens

357
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
A storm moves in

358
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And a concentration of energy summons a dangerous boss

359
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You must fight and defeat the boss to get its rewards

360
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Once you have defeated it

361
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Summon another

362
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And another

363
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And another

364
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And another

365
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You have ten total waves of boss fights

366
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Which get incrementally more difficult

367
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
If you manage to defeat them

368
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You get full boss rewards

369
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But also opportunities to get new runes

370
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
These can only be obtained from this map

371
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The Fractured Lake contains a surreal waterscape

372
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
With fractured mirror-like objects

373
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
As you move around the map

374
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
As you move around the map

375
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The terrain itself elevates from below

376
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Creating the ground you walk on

377
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
In this unique map

378
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
All the rare monsters are mirrored

379
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So you're always fighting two of the same rare

380
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
At the same time

381
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Which can prove quite difficult

382
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
If you manage to overcome that challenge

383
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And make it to the end of the map

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You'll be presented with a broken mirror

385
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
A powerful altar-like object

386
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That contains an item within it

387
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
The item contained within is a new base type

388
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Either an amulet or a ring

389
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
That can be crafted to have additional prefixes

390
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Or suffixes at the cost of the other

391
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The last unique map we'll show today

392
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Is one based around the essence mechanic

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You enter a crystalline cavern

394
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And you will find a powerful map boss

395
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Imprisoned in the centre

396
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It is surrounded by many rare monsters

397
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Also imprisoned in essences

398
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
By freeing and defeating the rare monsters

399
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The essence they held will be upgraded

400
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
To a greater essence

401
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And be added to the imprisoned map boss

402
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
How brave are you?

403
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
How many essences will you add to the boss?

404
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Overdo it and you might lose everything

405
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Underdo it and you might regret it

406
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's your choice

407
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Speaking of essences

408
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Alongside visual improvements

409
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You're now able to apply varlorbs

410
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
To corrupt the essences

411
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
With a range of unpredictable outcomes

412
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It could increase the number of essences

413
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Reroll all the essences to the same type

414
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Or even upgrade the essences to greater essences

415
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
What if they're already greater essences?

416
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Well, it can upgrade those too

417
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
We have four new corrupted essences

418
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Essences of hysteria, delirium, horror and insanity

419
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Each corrupted essence has its own interesting combat mechanics

420
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
For example, the essence of insanity causes you to question even your own mind

421
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
As monsters split into shadowy clones

422
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And you must locate the real one

423
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Before a devastating icy explosion freezes everything around it

424
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Each of these has their own crafting outcomes

425
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The essence of insanity can be applied to a belt

426
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It adds a mod that will ensure the next varlorb used on the belt

427
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Will guarantee adding two enchantments

428
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's worth noting all the essences in the unique map can also be corrupted too

429
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If you're willing to risk it

430
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
It's worth noting we have also added ten extra atlas passive points

431
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You can earn by completing five different unique maps

432
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Now, new maps are just the beginning

433
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
We had a goal where we wanted to make sure

434
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You were constantly finding exciting new content

435
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And that it could be lurking around any corner

436
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So, we have added a bunch of new things that you could stumble into

437
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
In any map you run

438
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
On your travels you will sometimes encounter rogue exiles

439
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Others like you who have been exiled and are openly hostile

440
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Some are malicious, some are mad

441
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
While others are simply fiends for loot

442
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
They will challenge you, a fight to the death

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
They use the same skills available to players

444
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And even the same items

445
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
They aren't just dressed up in those items

446
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
They're actually using them

447
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's going to feel like a true player versus player situation

448
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Of course, if you are able to slay these exiles

449
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Those items will all drop on the ground

450
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So, if you encounter an exile using a powerful or valuable unique item

451
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Which you can see displayed under their life bar

452
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You want to be damn sure you kill them

453
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Because if they kill you and your party

454
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
They'll portal out taking their items with them

455
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Every fight will feel completely different

456
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Depending on the items they come equipped with

457
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
These exiles are much smarter than your regular monster

458
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
They have capabilities to dodge roll

459
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Avoid your abilities with smart pathfinding

460
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Smart targeting

461
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And much more action-packed gameplay

462
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Fortunately, they're like you

463
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And they're not super durable

464
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Unless, of course, they're wearing uniques like Kalm's Heart

465
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
In which case, expect a longer battle

466
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
There are 12 different rogue exiles you can find

467
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Each with their own skills and personalities

468
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Some may insult you

469
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
While others may admire your honour in combat

470
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Another encounter you might stumble onto

471
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
In Dawn of the Hunt

472
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Are one of four new unique strongboxes

473
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Strongboxes are chests with modifiers

474
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
When you try to open them

475
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
They activate traps

476
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And spawn waves of monsters that you must defeat

477
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
To access the loot

478
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Let's take a look at two of the new unique boxes

479
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That are harder to find

480
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And behave just a little bit differently

481
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The Ogam's Legacy strongbox has a corpse splayed out

482
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
In front of the rune-carved stone

483
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Upon interacting with the stone

484
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You activate Forbidden Ezimite Magic

485
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Which revives the monster as a powerful red

486
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The strongbox comes with a modifier

487
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Which determines how many times it will revive that red

488
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Each time you defeat the monstrosity

489
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
The strongbox revives it again

490
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Adding an extra modifier to the monster

491
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
With each resurrection

492
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It becomes more difficult

493
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But also more rewarding

494
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
This strongbox is infused with Thaumaturgy

495
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
From ancient Fale technology

496
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
E-Shell's Torment has a powerful artifact inside

497
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And is guarded by Chaos itself

498
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Defeating the monsters will grant you a unique item

499
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
With a specific corrupted outcome

500
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You'll have to find the other two for yourself

501
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
To see what they do

502
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Now, let's talk about the introduction to the endgame

503
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Upon starting the endgame

504
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Doriani tasks you with cleansing corruption

505
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
To help restore the land

506
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
However, in practice

507
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The quest objective just sent you on a grind

508
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
To clear 15 maps

509
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We wanted to make the quest to unlock your atlas passives

510
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Much more interesting

511
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Now, Doriani is tasking you with a more specific objective

512
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
On the atlas you will find areas of corruption caused by the beast

513
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
In the centre of each one you will find a corrupted nexus

514
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The source of the affliction

515
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
In the areas leading up to the nexus

516
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You will notice that corruption spills out from slain enemies

517
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And amalgamates into powerful monsters

518
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Corrupted maps existed on the atlas before

519
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But we've done significant work on improving these monsters

520
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We've also done a full pass on the modifiers on these maps

521
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
To make them more interesting and more rewarding

522
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Once you reach the nexus you will have a new task

523
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Cleanse the source of corruption

524
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
When you defeat the last rare in those maps

525
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
They will spawn one of three terrifying bosses

526
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Amalgamations of corruption itself

527
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
After defeating that boss

528
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Doriani will come and cleanse the corruption for good

529
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
As the remains of the boss are purged of corruption

530
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It coalesces into raw crystallized power

531
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Which you can use to gain points for your atlas passive skill tree

532
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
The upgrade system that allows you to add and enhance content in your maps

533
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
We didn't stop there though

534
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
When you complete a corrupted nexus

535
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
All of the remaining surrounding corrupted maps will become cleansed maps

536
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Cleansed maps also have new monsters

537
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
A new boss

538
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And their own set of modifiers and rewards

539
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Including finding fracturing orbs by slaying cleansed enemies

540
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
These orbs can be used in crafting on a rare item

541
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
To cause one of its modifiers to become fractured

542
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
A fractured modifier is one that cannot be modified by any means

543
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You are able to freely modify the item

544
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Ensuring the fractured modifier will never change

545
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
If you get the right item

546
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
With the right mod

547
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It can prove to be a very powerful crafting base indeed

548
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You must now choose

549
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Do you complete all the corrupted maps and then the nexus?

550
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Or maybe you beeline to the nexus

551
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Complete it

552
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And do all the remaining maps cleansed

553
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Both have rewards to entice you

554
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And challenges to assess

555
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Now

556
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Let's have a talk about towers

557
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
One thing we've had a lot of feedback on

558
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Is the busy work around running towers

559
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And managing your tablets

560
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
The first change we've made here

561
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Is that we have reduced the number of towers drastically

562
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So there are now one third as many as before

563
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But we've made them much more powerful

564
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
To start with

565
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Tablets now inherently add twice as many mechanics

566
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But that's not all

567
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Running higher tier maps and towers

568
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Now increases the number of mechanics applied by tablets

569
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
By tier 15 the bonus is double

570
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Allowing a single tablet to now add four times as many mechanics as before

571
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So

572
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
We're running far fewer towers

573
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Dealing with fewer tablets

574
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And affecting even more maps than before

575
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But

576
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Because there were fewer towers overlapping with each other

577
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You won't get as many opportunities to stack different tablets

578
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
In order to solve this

579
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
We've made it so that each tower can consume up to three tablets at once

580
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You always get one slot on completing the tower

581
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But if you can complete a tower with more mods on the waystone

582
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You can unlock a second or third slot

583
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Overall

584
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
This allows for even more juicing from towers

585
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
While drastically reducing the amount of busy work you have to do

586
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
On top of that

587
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Towers are much more interesting maps

588
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Because they can now spawn with all mechanics

589
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Including bosses

590
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Each tower map has a new boss

591
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Let's take a look at a couple here

592
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The boss fight of the Alpine Ridge map

593
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Has two powerful witches contesting for territory

594
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
One witch has an affinity for ice

595
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
The other fire

596
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Who will win?

597
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Hopefully neither

598
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The boss of the sinking spire map

599
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Is a remnant of the Vaal

600
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That has been charged with lightning

601
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It uses a full suite of lightning abilities

602
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But be careful

603
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
If any of them hit the surrounding constructs

604
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
They will power up

605
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Another thing that we've seen a lot of feedback about

606
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Is sustaining waystones

607
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
As we looked into it

608
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We realized that the people who couldn't sustain waystones

609
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Were dying a lot

610
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
A lot more than we had expected

611
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And that made us realize something

612
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
During the campaign

613
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
The expectation is that you can die multiple times

614
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
In order to learn how to overcome challenges

615
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You are able to learn how the monsters behave

616
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Adapt to their skills

617
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And eventually overcome them

618
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But as soon as you get to the endgame

619
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
You are effectively no longer allowed to die

620
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
If you want to sustain waystones

621
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
By the time you are getting towards the end of endgame

622
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
We want you to have to be careful not to die

623
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But it certainly shouldn't be that we have such a sudden shift

624
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
As you run your first maps

625
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The first change we're making is you can now respawn

626
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And return to a map if you die

627
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Continuing from where you left off

628
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:47,000
When you start the endgame

629
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You get up to six total attempts per map

630
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
As you add more modifiers to a waystone

631
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The number of respawns goes down

632
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
This means that as you get to the point that you are running every waystone as a re—

633
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You will have to be more careful

634
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
In parties, everyone gets to respawn that number of times.

635
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But we still think it's important that you can kill a boss in one go.

636
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
In order to allow that to happen, we've made a change so that once you start the boss fight,

637
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
it changes over to the same respawning system we use for Pinnacle bosses.

638
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
This means that the map owner can choose to respawn everyone at the same time.

639
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Another complaint we've seen a lot of is players not wanting to do the Pinnacle content

640
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
because of the experience penalty from dying.

641
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
A change we've made here is that all Pinnacle content now no longer grants experience,

642
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
but also no longer removes experience on death either.

643
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Dawn of the Hunt also brings the first batch of Twilight Order Reliquary keys

644
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
from the Early Access Supporter Packs.

645
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
These keys contain items selected by our supporters.

646
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
They can contain any unique item found in Path of Exile too.

647
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
If the selected item is a Pinnacle boss drop, then only special keys dropped by this content

648
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
will be able to provide these items.

649
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
For example, Hand of Wisdom in Action can only come from a key dropped by Zest.

650
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,000
We're also making a change that allows Pinnacle boss uniques to drop at any difficulty.

651
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Rarer uniques will be rarer at lower difficulties, but still possible to find.

652
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
This applies to the drop charges for the Reliquary keys from this content as well.

653
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We spoke about towers and tablets earlier, but we have also added a suite of unique tablets.

654
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Each of these adds crazy interactions to the maps influenced by it.

655
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
For example, this unique tablet allows you to run any map in a tower's radius without requiring connections,

656
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
which can be quite useful for jumping gaps and traveling around your atlas.

657
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And this tablet causes all runic monsters spawned during expedition encounters to be duplicated,

658
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
and weakens all expedition monsters that emerge from the ground.

659
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
The Atlas tree has also been expanded, and you can find many of the new mechanics there.

660
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And improvements to existing ones too.

661
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Now through this livestream we have mentioned quite a few new crafting options that we've added.

662
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
New runes, corrupted essences, fractured mods, and jewelry crafting bases.

663
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
But we did have just one more crafting system to talk about. Recombination.

664
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Expedition was the only in-game mechanic that was lacking a crafting system, so that needed to change.

665
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Recombination is a mechanic that might be familiar to some players.

666
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It allows you to merge two items together, hoping to get the best elements of each on a single new item.

667
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
This new crafting bench will be unlocked as you complete your first expedition,

668
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and requires artifacts found during expeditions to fuel it.

669
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
The rarer the mods on the item you are combining, the more expensive the cost.

670
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
That wraps up all the major end-game changes we're talking about today.

671
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
With all the system changes and new content, we can't wait to get in there, start blasting maps, and obliterating monsters.

672
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
There is one more thing we wanted to clarify before we move on, which is that all the content we've talked about today

673
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
will be made available in the existing Early Access Leagues, so you can play your existing characters.

674
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
However, there will be new leagues made for those who wish to start in a fresh economy.

675
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It is recommended to start over and get the full new experience in the Dawn of the Hunt Leagues.

676
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:53,000
For all our existing Early Access players, we're really looking forward to joining you playing in this new update.

677
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
For those who don't already have access, and are interested in playing Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt,

678
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
you are able to at any time purchase an Early Access Supporter Pack at www.pathofexile2.com.

679
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Additionally, the Paladin and Penance Supporter Packs are now available to purchase in Path of Exile 2,

680
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and contain 6 microtransactions each, and the full pack's face value in points.

681
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
All the microtransactions contained within these packs are purely cosmetic,

682
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and do not affect your character's power or progression in any way.

683
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Thank you so much for your ongoing support.

684
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
We're just about to start the Q&A with ZiggyD.

685
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
With release at the end of next week, our community team will be posting crucial information you'll need for the release.

686
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Keep an eye on the news.

687
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
On release weekend, we expect to launch the new Mystery Box and many new microtransactions,

688
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
including Path of Exile 2's first alternate skill effects.

689
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Thanks for joining us today and checking out our latest developments.

690
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
We're looking forward to playing the Huntress, trying new builds, and exploring the new endgame next week.

691
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
We'll begin the Q&A shortly, so please get your questions ready.

692
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Good morning, Exiles, and welcome to the Q&A portion of today, after a very exciting reveal, with lots of new people,

693
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and the folks are going to be talking about the future.

694
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Great.

695
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Good morning, Exiles, and welcome to the Q&A portion of today.

696
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Good morning, exiles, and welcome to the Q&A portion of today after a very exciting reveal

697
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
with lots and lots in it, exceeding my expectations, particularly in crafting.

698
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But on that note, we're joined here by Jonathan and Mark to talk about all that we've seen today

699
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and more in the future of Path of Exile 2.

700
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And you had an update about the recombination.

701
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yes, that's right, that's right.

702
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah, so we actually last night had a bit of a design session

703
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and realized that we weren't actually fully happy with the way the recombination worked.

704
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So we actually made quite a big change to it, which wasn't reflected in that video, obviously,

705
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
which is basically that we sort of wanted to give a bit more control to the player

706
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
over how recombination works.

707
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And we also kind of weren't really happy about the fact that recombination is something

708
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
that kind of matters a lot for really, really ultra-endgame players,

709
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
but it wasn't something that was really mattering a lot for people who effectively got access

710
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
to the feature at the start.

711
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So we've actually changed it now so that the way it works is that you pick which mods you want

712
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
on each item, from each item.

713
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And then it gives you a percentage chance of success based on the number you picked.

714
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So if you pick just like one from one and one from the other,

715
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
then the chance is much, much higher.

716
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
But if you pick six mods, it'll become practically impossible.

717
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So effectively, you know, like the more you're wanting to design the item,

718
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
the less of a chance of actually having success.

719
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So it means that if you just want to get like a mod, if you want to get an item with like,

720
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
okay, these two mods that I've found off the ground, that's, you know, relatively easy.

721
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
If you want to get an item which has, you know, all of them then are very hard.

722
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So we think that's a much better design because it means you can kind of use the,

723
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
the recombinators actually become something that you can use even from a relatively,

724
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
from the first point you get them.

725
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
But there's still this kind of endgame, like, you know, like for perfect, perfect stuff,

726
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
you might still be able to do it with more.

727
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It is kind of balanced though, so that like, like if you pick literally all six,

728
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
then it's going to be like incredibly low to the point of like, don't even try that.

729
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
But, you know, like four mods might be a good thing to sort of be striving for,

730
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
that kind of thing, and then exalt the other two, that kind of stuff.

731
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So yeah, that's kind of the new design of that.

732
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So hopefully that'll be in by the time Zero Two comes out.

733
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
We're going to, we've kind of got a plan for doing that.

734
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But yeah, like I think it's a much better design than what we had before for recombinators.

735
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
If it's not there for Zero Two, it'll be as soon as it can afterwards.

736
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But yeah, you know, spur of the moment, night before the live stream design sessions.

737
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
But increased player agency and visibility into the success result is just a win.

738
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And honestly, took way too long to, you know, get to the point of us actually going,

739
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
this is just straight up better to have observability into that and the freedom of choice.

740
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Sure, sure.

741
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

742
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Recombination definitely felt like something that was both really high end in terms of the crafting that it was intended for,

743
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
but also just even understanding it.

744
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,000
This seems much more intuitive.

745
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yes.

746
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You just pick what you want.

747
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Selecting the mods you want.

748
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

749
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So it does sound like it's a little bit of a nerf for the very high end of crafting though.

750
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It might end up being, but I'm not like, it sort of depends on how the numbers come out.

751
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Like because we only just designed this, we need to still work out like exactly how the numbers end up looking.

752
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But I mean, look, we have to make sure, obviously whenever we're designing any crafting system,

753
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
we have to be really sure that we're not like screwing over finding stuff on the ground.

754
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So, you know, you have to, you have to sort of have that balance.

755
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And that's, you know, so that kind of informs everything we do with crafting usually.

756
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
One difference here though, of course, is if the success chance fails, both items are destroyed as opposed to always keeping one.

757
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

758
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So, okay.

759
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So it's basically a percent chance for success.

760
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And if it fails, item's gone.

761
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So, yeah.

762
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Roughly, what do you think you'd try to pitch just choosing two mods at?

763
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It depends on what mods you're selecting.

764
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But I'm kind of thinking kind of like 35%-ish kind of thing for like two normal mods, that kind of thing.

765
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
For both to go over?

766
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, for them both.

767
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,000
If you pick two.

768
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yeah.

769
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And then, you know, but we'll see.

770
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It kind of depends.

771
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It kind of depends.

772
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,000
We'll see how the way to do some math.

773
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Higher team mods are rarer.

774
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah, exactly.

775
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,000
So it's sort of an exception.

776
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And also, the other thing is it's going to now have a fixed cost.

777
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So it's not going to, you know.

778
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And the idea is like doing a single expedition should be enough to do a recombination.

779
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So, you know, you're going to be doing them like relatively often as you're doing expeditions.

780
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So is the part of expedition where you get to craft with the NPCs still a thing then?

781
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Now that you're adding this?

782
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Yeah, I mean, you've still got that whole mechanic.

783
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So effectively, it's competing for the artifacts.

784
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Yeah.

785
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Between recombination versus buying things from that other way.

786
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So is there some buffs intended for that then to make it more competitive?

787
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Not yet.

788
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It definitely needs some love in the future, but not at this time.

789
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yeah.

790
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It seems like the systems can kind of go hand in hand where one is giving you items that you can then potentially recombinate.

791
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,000
That is also true.

792
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You can use the ingredients of one in the other.

793
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Yeah.

794
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Or the outcome of one as an ingredient in another.

795
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah.

796
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Cool.

797
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We'll talk more about crafting a little bit later on for sure because there was a lot announced there, which I'm quite excited about.

798
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Definitely exceeded my predictions for what you'd be adding in terms of crafting.

799
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But firstly, though, just a quick clarification on the league.

800
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So there's not going to be a wipe for the new players joining us.

801
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
If you were playing on a character, you can still keep playing on a character.

802
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
But a lot of long-term Path of Exile players know the importance of playing on a fresh start.

803
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And it's also really important for you guys as well.

804
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,000
For sure.

805
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah.

806
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:49,000
I mean, basically, if we don't have any character that's come from before, you're just not going to – because the balance is so different and because so many things have changed, there's no point in even listening to feedback for someone who's playing in the old league.

807
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It really has to be that you're doing the fresh start and we're sort of seeing how things go in the new economy.

808
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So we were really sort of – it was kind of an interesting decision about whether or not we should make it so that all the content is exclusive.

809
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Or rather, what amount of content would be exclusive to the league versus not.

810
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And the issue that we had was that – so, I mean, a league means something in Path of Exile.

811
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
In order for something to be – to rise to the level of a league, it needs a certain amount of features.

812
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And the original thing we were thinking about doing that way would be the Asmere and Wisps.

813
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But there wasn't quite, like, the kind of, like, meta mechanics and, you know, stuff with that.

814
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So, like, we didn't quite rise to the level of feeling like it deserved to be a challenge league.

815
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And at the same time, we've also got a lot of new players playing Path of Exile too.

816
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Never played Path of Exile before.

817
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So we were a little bit – like, we kind of were deciding, like, should we – yeah, should we make them exclusive or not?

818
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
We sort of decided, you know what?

819
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
For this one, we're not going to.

820
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:51,000
And then what we'll probably try and do is for the next – for the next league that we do, we'll actually make it a proper challenge league with, like, its own exclusive mechanic and so on.

821
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But, yeah, it's a little bit funny because, like, in early access, there's a bit of a different situation.

822
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You know, like – and so, yeah, we'll sort of see how this goes anyway.

823
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
But certainly I would encourage everyone just, like, start again on a new character.

824
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And I think, you know, you'll have a much better time because, you know, obviously if you're – there's structural changes to the passive tree.

825
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
It's like if you log in with your character, you're going to have, like – you know, your tree's going to get reset.

826
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You have to do stuff.

827
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You know, like, there's things like that that are going to happen that mean that – and, you know, also just balance changes, right?

828
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Like, huge numbers of them.

829
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So you're going to have a better time playing from the start.

830
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,000
That's it.

831
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And speaking of the Huntress then, so we saw our initial Huntress quite some time ago now and had some hands-on time with it and things.

832
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But I certainly, having played that before and played it now recently, the Huntress has changed quite a lot.

833
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

834
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So what was the – how hard was it to get it ready for release?

835
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,000
What was kind of the key there?

836
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I mean, it's funny because class design is one of those things where every time you add something, it can make you re-evaluate everything else,

837
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
which is why it's so hard to predict, like, how long a class will take.

838
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
So, like, it changed a lot since the last time we had – like, we were showing Huntress.

839
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And honestly, like, you know, it's – like, while there are some skills that you will still see, like, it just plays completely different.

840
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And, I mean, whenever we're looking at, like, how we're going to design something like this, it really comes down to, like, what is – it's special about the character class.

841
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Like, how can we double down on that to make sure it feels different?

842
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So with the Huntress, you've obviously got Spears as a base type.

843
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Like, the key difference between a Spear and any other weapon type is that you can both use them at melee and you can also use them at range.

844
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,000
You can throw them.

845
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And so because of that, you know, we really were just really trying to incentivize everything possible so that you use both of those things.

846
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And, you know, Action RPG players, they – you know, generally speaking, you know, the balance can often be such that you only really want to do one thing and do that one thing well.

847
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So trying to incentivize the kind of ranged and melee is, you know, quite a thing.

848
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And, I mean, the way we do it effectively is try to make sure that, like, there are combo chains where, you know, a ranged thing can combo with something that's melee and a melee thing can combo with something that's ranged.

849
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And then also give you good abilities to move between the two states.

850
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And so that kind of means that you end up with a very, like, agile character.

851
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Like, you're constantly moving, like, backwards and forwards and kind of moving around.

852
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And I would say that, like, given that it's the dex character, that it's good that it feels that way, that it feels the most agile of all of the melee character classes.

853
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So, you know, that's been a really good one.

854
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
But, you know, I mean, look, there are – in terms of changes, I mean, look, there are just changes all the time.

855
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Like, the frenzy charge thing was, like, relatively late in development.

856
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Like, there's, like, quite a lot of things going on that just meant that, you know, the feel kept on evolving.

857
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And another big one, of course, was parry, which I honestly was very skeptical of working.

858
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And Mark, like, Mark was the one who saved it, honestly.

859
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Like, I was like, you know what?

860
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
There was, like, three times, I think, where I was like, you know what?

861
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I don't think it's going to work.

862
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And then you were like, okay, I think, you know, we're going to save this.

863
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I was like, give me a week.

864
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

865
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And it works completely differently than most games.

866
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Because in most games, obviously, with parrying, the way that works is that, you know, you have to time the – like, to push the block button at exactly the right time.

867
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
But that's just something that just wouldn't work in our combat system because, you know, you're often in packs of monsters.

868
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It's just like you don't really have the ability to read combat in that way in our game.

869
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And at the same time, we need to make something where there's going to be, like, you know, if a single monster in a pack hits you, you need to be able to respond to that with something that's going to –

870
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
you know, you need to be able to respond in a way where you don't just then immediately get hit by a bunch of other stuff.

871
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Yes.

872
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So having it so that the parry – like, it always parries, but it's then taking advantage of what the parry does to the monster by following up with something that's going to give you, like, you know, an explosion or something like that to kind of deal with the pack.

873
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
That's something that sort of allows that counter gameplay to work in our game.

874
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So you've kind of got two primary parry follow-ups.

875
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You've got the frenzy charge one, which dashes back, which means that, you know, you don't have to worry about the monsters hitting you.

876
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And then you've also got the one that – there's another one, which I don't believe we showed there, which, you know, called Fangs of Frost, which does a counter where you attack with ice, which freezes the pack.

877
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
So it's another way to kind of – so in both cases, you've kind of got something that's kind of dealing with the fact that you've got all these monsters around you.

878
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And that was kind of the biggest challenge, I think, that we had with that kind of – yeah.

879
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yeah, I'll also make note of there was a support gem I found that you can attach to any attack that allows you to follow up parry to generate a frenzy charge too.

880
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So it doesn't even have to be the backflip.

881
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah, yeah, in that case.

882
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah, I mean, there's other –

883
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Create your own parry follow-ups.

884
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And then, of course, there's always Sniper's Mark, you know, and there's, like – there is a skill that does give you a guaranteed crit, so that's a potential option as well.

885
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Like, you've got a few different ways to generate them.

886
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Because parry guarantees a light stun.

887
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Yeah.

888
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,000
You always get that small window to actually engage or do a thing before they – before you're under danger again.

889
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And I'll tell you this, like, I am one of those players who never parry, right, in any game ever because I can never do it.

890
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It's always just so frustrating.

891
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So I was very skeptical of that.

892
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
But it feels really good.

893
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
You've both managed to make it something that's easy to do because you can just hold the button down and parry at any time.

894
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
There's no skill involved in that.

895
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But at the same time, you've incentivized making it so that you do want to still try and time it as best you can personally by – well, how have you done that?

896
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
How have you made it so that, like, you actually still want to kind of play it skillfully?

897
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Well, I mean, ultimately, you know, any time you're holding down the parry button is when you're not attacking, right?

898
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
So you still want to kind of minimize the window.

899
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But at the same time, like, the timing is just not, like, you know, not as bad.

900
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But the nice thing as well is that, like, once you do successfully parry, it's very obvious.

901
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You get the sound.

902
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You get, like, the token on the monster.

903
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It's very chunky.

904
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So, you know, it means it's very obvious when you're supposed to counterattack.

905
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So, yeah, I'm very happy with that.

906
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I think that it came out really well.

907
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And honestly, one of the funny things about it is that it immediately made me realize, like, how bad shields are in comparison,

908
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
which is why we're also trying to ninja in a change to how shields work at the last minute,

909
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
which we'll see if it makes it into 020.

910
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I was playing around with it last night.

911
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Yeah, this was 8 p.m. last night.

912
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Yeah, 8 p.m. last night, exactly.

913
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Messing with this.

914
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Yeah, messing around with it.

915
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And so, you know, I won't talk too much about how that's going to work.

916
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
But effectively, we want to make the shields better as well and kind of build something into those to make them more interesting.

917
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So, yeah, that's the plan there.

918
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
We'll see if it makes it for 020.

919
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Yeah, following that kind of similar design space idea of being able to do a bit more with it.

920
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Yeah.

921
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And then that feed into other skills and things like that as well.

922
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
There's a lot of room there to play with.

923
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah.

924
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So we talked about Huntress being very combo heavy, and she has the deepest combo chains out of anyone so far,

925
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
even exceeding, like, things you can do with Monk.

926
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
You've got three, four different skills deep of things you can start to synergize together.

927
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So how do you balance, how do you make that fun, firstly, like, rather than, like, onerous, for example?

928
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Well, I mean, you just, I guess there's a few things.

929
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Like, one of them is it just has to be very readable and understandable when, like, you know, like, what you can do and when you can do it.

930
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And I think the other thing that's really to our advantage here is reusing skills in multiple ways so you don't need, so you can make a deeper combo chain without requiring you to be using as many skills in order to do it.

931
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So the way that Whirling Slash and Tornadoes interact with ground effects and kind of, like, all that stuff sort of means that, you know, you're using Whirling Slash multiple times as part of the same combo chain.

932
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And that's an idea, I think, that I'd like to try and explore more because I think that it is a cool way to kind of extend the combo chain, yeah, as I said, without sort of getting too many things involved.

933
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And that makes it a lot cooler.

934
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So, yeah, I'll think a bit more about, you know, how we can apply that to other classes and other skills.

935
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But, yeah, it's worked out really well here.

936
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah, it's a bit of, like, a loose create-your-own combo system in a way.

937
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Like, obviously there's intended combos, but because it's interacting with something that's fundamental, like ground effects, you're able to combo with anything that creates a ground effect.

938
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And there's a lot of different ways you can do that.

939
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Like, I added Shocked Ground to the backflip skill, or I got a companion pet that had a Shocked Ground aura.

940
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Nice, nice, nice.

941
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So that was just there, and that was available all the time.

942
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I mean, it's funny as well because it also works on just enemy ground effects.

943
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And so sometimes you can just get a damage boost because the rare just happened to be dropping ground fire or something.

944
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So that's kind of fun.

945
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

946
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
But it's been a, it's just a lot of fun to play.

947
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
You know, the first time I ran into that was actually in the graveyard where there's these, like, chests that, like, pop open with fire.

948
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
And, like, I was using tornadoes, and then one of them just randomly turned into a fire tornado.

949
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And I'm like, oh, what happened there?

950
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Oh, yeah, sweet.

951
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It was just, like, a really cool moment where you're just sort of interacting with the environment, which was really fun.

952
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I, yeah, it always feels like you're getting a little bit of something extra for free when you're taking advantage of the enemy effects or a boss fight that just has burning ground everywhere.

953
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I was like, sweet.

954
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So how do you go about balancing, though, when you have a class that has deeper combos and kind of somewhat requires you to do a bit more versus a class or a skill or a build that is just bonk?

955
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I mean, you have to ultimately make the combos matter, right?

956
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:47,000
And I think, actually, that's one of those things that we're trying to really focus on with the balance changes we're doing in Dawn of the Hunt more generally is making sure that even, like, I think it's the case where some of the combo gameplay kind of degenerates a little bit by endgame in a way that, like, I want to make sure it still feels rewarded.

957
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And so we were sort of doing various checks, you know, like, recently about, you know, like, as a random example, right?

958
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Like, so on the Mercenary, we found that doing, you know, but when you get to endgame, doing armor break, sorry, what's it called?

959
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
The armor piercing that causes armor break followed with high velocity rounds is just worse than just using high velocity rounds.

960
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And that's, like, really bad, right?

961
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Like, we have to make sure that we're improving that stuff.

962
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,000
So it's, like, sometimes you just get these things where, like, the balance by endgame kind of degenerates in a way that doesn't support the combo anymore.

963
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And so we have to make sure that when we're looking at buffing things that we're, like, making sure that when we're doing it, it's to support the fact that using more things is actually a good thing.

964
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So, yeah, we're really trying to make sure that we're bringing some of that, you know, improving some of that stuff as well as we're doing the balance changes.

965
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So do you have, like, a baseline there of where, like, the really simplest build should be, the build that just bonks?

966
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I mean, you mean in terms of damage or in terms of, like, what it does?

967
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
You know, I mean, we always want you to be able to build that way.

968
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I guess the players have to do a combo.

969
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I mean, no, ultimately you never have to, right?

970
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
But it sort of means, what it means is that, you know, you are sacrificing something.

971
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And, look, the ideal situation is that, like, you don't feel like you have to do combos.

972
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
You feel like you want to do combos, right?

973
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Because you feel rewarded for them.

974
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's like, it should feel like a fun, like, oh, I can add this, you know?

975
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Like, it's the feeling you should be getting.

976
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yeah.

977
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I think the Huntress is doing that very well.

978
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It must have been, like, extremely hard because I don't think I've ever seen this, like, ranged melee combo done well before.

979
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Well, I mean, it does require a lot of discipline.

980
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And it means that a lot of skills, like, end up on the cutting room floor because you try them out and then you realize, well, if this is in the game, then that's the only thing I'm ever going to do.

981
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So you've got to be really careful about that stuff.

982
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Certainly playing the Huntress now makes me go back and look at the other classes and be like, we need to up that, the level there.

983
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And we miss the mark a little bit now because this is better.

984
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And who's to say the next class won't even be better and make us question even this?

985
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But, you know.

986
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But that's the way it is with class design.

987
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,000
That's what he says to me.

988
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Like, literally, when you make a new class, you question everything.

989
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
He's not understating the level of questioning everything.

990
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Yeah.

991
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Do you see, like, going back to the Monk at some point and looking for more, like, opportunities to link skills together?

992
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I mean, we haven't got to the full skill set for any class yet already.

993
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And we need to add more pieces for a lot.

994
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I think there's at least four skills that were designed and then aren't in the Monk currently.

995
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yep.

996
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Ranger the same.

997
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
There was extra poison skills.

998
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
There was intended to be more chaos darts.

999
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
All kinds of stuff.

1000
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We have to, obviously, at some point, fill all of that in.

1001
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Hard to say when, but we're going to try and incrementally get it.

1002
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Like, much like how Ray Spector and, I mean, the mount works with the Huntress,

1003
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
but we were like, let's give something for the Ranger this time.

1004
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Let's give something for the summoners out there this time.

1005
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And so we're just going to keep filling in those gaps over time.

1006
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And it feels like you're getting better at class and skill design as you go to.

1007
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So I imagine the last class you're going to release is going to be, like, amazing.

1008
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You'll look back at the first ones and be like, ooh.

1009
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Possibly.

1010
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That is the worry.

1011
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,000
But whatever.

1012
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
But look, that just means we've got another round of going through everything and improving stuff again, right?

1013
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And that will never end.

1014
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
That's it.

1015
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:52,000
But so with the parry came the kind of looking at the player getting stunned.

1016
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
In particular, the player heavy stun.

1017
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So it's always hard to tell players, like, hey, we're going to do something to you, and it's going to be a bad thing.

1018
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You're not going to like this.

1019
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Well, the funny thing.

1020
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Let's talk about why.

1021
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
There's a few things like that, actually.

1022
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Because, I mean, for a start, we needed the downside of parry to be, you know, like, yeah, you get stunned out of it.

1023
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But then when we're looking at how long, like, we're like, okay, right now, even, and it's true with shield block as well, by the way.

1024
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It's like, if you get stunned out of that, the amount of time that you get stunned out for is actually not even enough time for most bosses to do a follow-up attack on you.

1025
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And it's like, well, where's the downside if it doesn't even have enough time?

1026
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
So we did have to extend that out a little bit.

1027
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And it makes you a little bit more careful.

1028
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
But just to warn people, right, there's a few other things.

1029
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Like, we lowered, what's it called?

1030
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
The, I can't remember the name of that thing now.

1031
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
The thing that makes you more easy to be elemental statuses apply to you.

1032
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Element threshold.

1033
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,000
That's right.

1034
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Element threshold.

1035
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Yeah.

1036
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
So we lowered element threshold to actually make it so the player has those mechanics happen more to them, right?

1037
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Because, like, right now through campaign, like, you barely get frozen or burning or shocked, really, to be honest.

1038
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So there's stuff like that that we've had to do to kind of make sure that, you know, that.

1039
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Because if you don't have that stuff actually happen to you, then there's no point in mitigating it.

1040
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And it's like, you know, things like charms were, like, not very useful because, you know, those mechanics weren't happening to you.

1041
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
There's stuff like that, right?

1042
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:17,000
The downsides do actually matter in order to make it so that, you know, that you then, you know, there's other things you can do to sort of bypass those downsides.

1043
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So, yeah, that's kind of one of those things that, you know, we just have to make sure is there.

1044
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I did always find it a little bit strange that, like, I was able to count the number of times I was frozen in the campaign on one finger.

1045
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
For sure.

1046
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,000
For sure.

1047
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,000
For sure.

1048
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
But as always by those vile ghosts.

1049
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

1050
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So expect a little bit more, like, a little bit more danger from the stun.

1051
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I definitely died a couple of times to getting heavy stun.

1052
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

1053
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,000
It can happen.

1054
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So that's mostly occurring if you're, like, doing bad blocking or parrying.

1055
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But can it also occur just from, like, taking a really big hit or something?

1056
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Nope.

1057
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
At least we've discussed that.

1058
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
We've gone through a whole bunch of different, like, should certain boss abilities heavy stun you?

1059
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And if you speak into enough stun threshold, it, like, demotes it to a light stun.

1060
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And if that, you know, there's all kinds of mere multi-hour discussions we've had.

1061
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And we haven't really come to anything conclusive there.

1062
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But it's only from mount, raise shield, and parry.

1063
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,000
And of which, you know, at least for all of them, you can see your stagger bar filling up.

1064
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
It's worth noting things like evasion apply to...

1065
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So when you're parrying, we turn off your evasion from taking damage because the block does.

1066
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Right?

1067
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And otherwise you'd be like, I'm going to parry it.

1068
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Oh, I evaded it.

1069
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It didn't parry.

1070
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But you can evade the stagger buildup.

1071
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So you don't take the damage anyway.

1072
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Just before anyone misunderstands that.

1073
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
The evasion still works.

1074
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Yeah.

1075
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So high evasion will mean you can parry for longer.

1076
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
There's a bunch of parry stuff on the tree.

1077
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Including damage affecting the debuff.

1078
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
The duration of the debuff.

1079
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
So you get to benefit for it longer.

1080
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Reducing stagger is all over the place for both mount and...

1081
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So in the deck section of the tree.

1082
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So yeah, you can mitigate...

1083
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I mean, my expectation is probably you'll get some endgame builds that are just like,

1084
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I can parry forever.

1085
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
There's no real consequence.

1086
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Not every skill can be parried, of course.

1087
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Yeah, it otherwise follows the slam rules.

1088
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
If it's a slam from above or below, you can't parry it.

1089
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Much to your frustration for something.

1090
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I mean, there are a few things where I've got disagreements about what looks like it's parryable, but...

1091
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,000
My helpful there was when it's contentious, people would bring it up and we'd change it, right?

1092
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Sure, sure.

1093
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
So like, if it's on the line, it's meant to be blockable.

1094
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
If it isn't clear.

1095
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And there was no way with hundreds of monsters and many dozens of bosses that we weren't going to miss some things.

1096
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So you mentioned this a little bit earlier, but action RPGs kind of naturally pull you towards one damage type, one skill, one specific thing and optimizing as much as possible.

1097
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Because otherwise you're just making a bad build a lot of the time.

1098
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
But I noticed Huntress has a bit of everything.

1099
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
She's got bleed.

1100
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
She's got all the elements.

1101
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
She's got physical.

1102
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
The only thing she doesn't have is like chaos, but there's kind of poison on the tree right there.

1103
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So how do you like promote this, like all of this different stuff together?

1104
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Are you supposed to only kind of be relegated to using two or three skills or are these supposed to come together?

1105
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And how do you manage that?

1106
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Well, there's a few things.

1107
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:16,000
So one of them is that we provide a lot of combos with the expectation that, you know, you'll probably be focusing around like a few specific things rather than necessarily using the whole tree.

1108
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So like there's that.

1109
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
The other thing as well is just making sure that in the passive tree there's sort of options that go across both.

1110
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So the Huntress's passive tree has quite a lot of things like, you know, extra melee damage if you've done a ranged attack recently.

1111
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,000
And then it's got things like bonuses against blinded enemies because while you're in a whirling slash there's, you know, sort of stuff like that.

1112
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:45,000
We're trying to carefully think like, well, how can we come up with something that's interesting and buffs everything that you might want to be doing, you know, that kind of synergizes with the stuff that Huntress can do.

1113
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:52,000
But it is honestly hard because, yeah, like many categories of things only matter for, you know, one thing, part of a combo.

1114
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So it's just like trying to come up with categories that can somehow span all of them in different ways.

1115
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And, you know, ideally, you know, we can achieve that.

1116
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
But yeah, it is pretty hard.

1117
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Generally, you're going to become more niche or more selective because, again,

1118
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
even mixing elemental and bleed is just probably often going to result in something.

1119
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
You probably wouldn't do both elemental and bleed.

1120
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You'd probably choose one or the other.

1121
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
But that's why we kind of try to make sure that, like, so you've got sort of linkages between them though, right?

1122
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Because it's like, for example, the Thunderous Leap detonates the spears that you do from the bleed thing.

1123
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:28,000
So it's kind of like the idea there is to, like, it changes how that skill then has a use in the combo with the other one.

1124
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So even if that skill itself isn't doing a lot of damage, it's triggering something that's taking advantage of all the damage bonuses you got for your bleed stuff.

1125
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So that's kind of like the idea is just to link all that stuff in a bit so that you can use the non, like, directly, you know, synergistic things in a kind of more synergistic way.

1126
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah, that's, if you didn't see that from the earlier trailer, you spear them with a bunch of spears and then jump on them and it explodes them.

1127
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
So it's really amazing.

1128
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
But, yeah, that's using an elemental skill, like, in another way as a detonator.

1129
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But, and even more, you've got weapon swaps as well.

1130
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yeah, of course, of course, of course.

1131
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I mean, there's all those systems we already added about all that kind of stuff.

1132
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So, you know, I mean, like, what will be interesting is whether or not we miss something cross-class, right?

1133
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:17,000
That's always a concern is someone will come up with some way to abuse something, you know, between something that's going on in the spear skills with some other class that we've failed to consider.

1134
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Yeah, I mean, so that's it.

1135
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
When we look at a new class, we typically, like, call it, like, oh, Huntress is spears.

1136
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
But kind of not really.

1137
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
It's a signature weapon.

1138
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Absolutely.

1139
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
But nothing in the ascendancies prescribes spears.

1140
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Exactly.

1141
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So, effectively, we take great pains to make sure that the ascendancies never mention weapon types, that there's, like, that they're always generalized.

1142
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So, for example, the, like, infusion mechanic in the Amazon, it just says projectiles.

1143
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It doesn't say spears.

1144
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And the reason it does that is so that you could make an Amazon who is a, you know, a bow user.

1145
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And that's all fine.

1146
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
So, yeah, like, it's effectively, like.

1147
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Open-ended.

1148
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
It's open-ended.

1149
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,000
And honestly, like, I know that Mark, like, does, like, it makes the constraints a lot harder for how to design an ascendancy class.

1150
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
You have to think about it that way, for sure.

1151
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Oh, it'd be much, much easier to just put a bunch of cool spear stuff in there.

1152
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Right.

1153
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Now, only really.

1154
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I mean, it was similar to the original Peewee 1 Saboteur.

1155
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It called out traps and mines.

1156
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And so, yeah, if you're a trap and mine character, what are you doing?

1157
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Well, that.

1158
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
You could do something else, but no one else is playing that thing, you know?

1159
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It isn't.

1160
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
It is easier to design.

1161
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,000
It is certainly less flexible and open as to what people can play in the different combinations and all that.

1162
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So, yeah.

1163
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
How much do you have to consider the different weapons and the skills and how they interact together when you're originally designing them?

1164
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Or is there just literally so many possible combinations you're just like, the players will take care of that for us?

1165
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I mean, I think it is relatively impossible to come up with everything.

1166
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
But certainly we have to consider, like, you know, is this going to be broken with anything else in particular?

1167
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And there just has to be certain rules for things about, like, you know, how easy is it to apply this debuff?

1168
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
How easy it is to consume this debuff?

1169
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And even then, it's like, you know, we often make mistakes and have issues.

1170
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So, you know, I mean.

1171
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
When he says relatively impossible, it is actually impossible.

1172
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Actually, yes.

1173
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But, you know, I mean, yeah.

1174
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
That's relative.

1175
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
But even just looking at the balance pass we're doing at the moment, right?

1176
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I mean, there's hundreds and, like, there's hundreds of things, like, that, you know, that we still.

1177
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I mean, there's things that we could never honestly understand all of the different broken things that could possibly exist.

1178
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And so it's like, it really does depend a lot on the, you know, like, on seeing reports on what people are doing on some level, right?

1179
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But then I think that what will happen over time is obviously, like, you know, the game is still relatively new.

1180
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
We're still making relatively big changes.

1181
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Over time, the balance, I think, will get to the point where we no longer have these, like, crazy outliers to the same extent.

1182
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
And it should mean that we get to some sort of relative class parity.

1183
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:46,000
By parity, what I mean is, like, you know, people playing all the different classes rather than focusing only on a few as we get towards full release.

1184
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Because, you know, right now it's obviously very skewed because, you know, there's certain broken things.

1185
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
So, you know, yeah, we just, the balance over time, we'll get there.

1186
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:01,000
It's one of the main goals and benefits of the early access is just, like, let's get the balance of characters right.

1187
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And, yeah, this patch release was always going to have a thousand problems, or probably 10,000 problems, you know?

1188
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,000
The next one will have half that, the next one half that, and probably eventually it's going to be down to, like, here's only a few things going, you know, out of whack.

1189
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:20,000
There's always going to be something because we add too much content for it to even be controlled.

1190
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Like, again, there are too many uniques, too many supports, too many skills, and too many other changes for any amount of people.

1191
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Like, you're talking about a matter of you'd have to put in, like, thousands and thousands of hours internally to find it where, and then you give it to the players.

1192
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
There's so many people it's going to take literally five minutes.

1193
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So it is, it's very beneficial.

1194
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:56,000
We're lucky in that regard that we get that level of testing and feedback on such a mass level, and especially, you know, with things like Ninja and all of that, and other people being able to see it and discuss it more openly, we're just going to be able to iterate on it even faster.

1195
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
But, yeah, every single patch, you're going to see a pretty substantial change in what's going to happen here.

1196
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Thanks for making the broken builds.

1197
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Well, 100%.

1198
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,000
100%.

1199
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I mean, you mentioned support gems.

1200
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It's, like, over 100 support gems added just this patch.

1201
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Mm-hmm.

1202
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
It's already, like, so many, and with you doing a different weapon for each of the, what, 16 classes?

1203
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Yeah, there's going to be a lot with the time we're done.

1204
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
But there kind of has to be, right?

1205
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Because, you know...

1206
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
That's what, you made it, you made this system that you need so many supports to support.

1207
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,000
You do.

1208
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Because otherwise it's not going to work.

1209
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

1210
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Especially with this one support system.

1211
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
It's like, what have you guys done?

1212
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Well, I mean, look, this is why we have recommendations, and hopefully we can improve those as well and continue to...

1213
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
...to get that better.

1214
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You know, like...

1215
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
There's certainly room for the complexity to get a little bit out of control here.

1216
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So the recommenders are going to become more and more important.

1217
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Right.

1218
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
So we need to make sure those are very much right.

1219
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Mm-hmm.

1220
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,000
For sure.

1221
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
You must be looking to players, even, to find some of those recommendations down the line as well.

1222
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,000
In some cases.

1223
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Yeah.

1224
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,000
In some cases.

1225
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
What stuff is popularly getting used for some...

1226
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
So the thing with the recommendations, though, is that they can't really take into account what you've already got on the gem.

1227
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Yeah.

1228
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
So the recommendations have to be just sort of generally good, but not really taken into account combos.

1229
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And, you know, that kind of means they're a bit more simple.

1230
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Like, the recommendations are going to be more simple than what you'd otherwise be doing if you're not following.

1231
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Feels like at some point you're going to need some sort of nested recommendation system.

1232
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
It's like, well, I'm kind of doing bleed stuff.

1233
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So you go into the submenu for feed recommendations.

1234
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Yeah, I'm less certain about that, because I kind of don't want to get into the thing of actually telling you what your build should be.

1235
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
So, yeah, that's a little different there.

1236
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Maybe, like, more sorting methods for the show me all the gems.

1237
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Oh!

1238
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Because there's a lot that are only in there that I never recommended, right, at this point.

1239
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
There are, yes.

1240
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:36,000
There are.

1241
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
It's going to be an interesting challenge you guys have set yourselves to make enough supports there.

1242
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,000
So another thing that you managed to challenge that you set yourselves, and I always wonder, like,

1243
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
why did you do this to yourselves with Spectres?

1244
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
So originally those were planned to be in for launch, but obviously Spectres are a whole can of worms.

1245
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
It's, hey, let's just give players access to every monster.

1246
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Also, we've made so many new monsters.

1247
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yeah.

1248
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
We're talking about all the broken.

1249
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
There's going to be some broken in there, I promise you.

1250
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And there's going to be some stuff we have to change.

1251
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I mean, you know, they've done, but I mean, effectively, what the time between early access and this was,

1252
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
was like, okay, let's actually attempt, at least, to do a balance pass of this,

1253
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
and, like, see if there's anything that's going to be a problem, and then adjust up the support.

1254
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Yeah, but now you've got to count all those support gems on all those monsters.

1255
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Yes.

1256
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Well, this is an interesting thing, isn't it?

1257
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
The support gems work on them.

1258
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And, you know, like, what the hell is that going to do?

1259
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Yeah, like, it's impossible to completely know.

1260
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:43,000
But, yeah, look, I mean, there's probably definitely some dark secrets lying in what kind of specter mix with support gems are going to do.

1261
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
And monsters have skills now.

1262
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
It's not like P.O.E. 1, where it's, like, just a bunch of zombies just doing default attack.

1263
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
It's, like, everything pretty much has a skill now at this point.

1264
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
But, you know, the great thing about it is we got to leverage all that work again for the beast taming as well.

1265
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So, and, of course, the difference there is that you also get the mods from the thing that you tamed.

1266
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
So, you know, that's going to be...

1267
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Auras, ground effects.

1268
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Yeah, exactly.

1269
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Expon-death explosions.

1270
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You've got a whole other ruckus of potential interactions.

1271
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So, you know, we'll see what happens there.

1272
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:20,000
We've done nice specific player versions of those things, specifically when you tame the beast so that they're not sitting there spamming skills in your hideout and all of that.

1273
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Good.

1274
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Yes.

1275
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:30,000
But also, like, there actually are player versions of the mods that Rez can get, like, so that we can balance them if we need to.

1276
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Yeah.

1277
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Because some of that stuff was actually would be ridiculous if you had it yourself.

1278
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So, you know, basically, we still have it sort of work.

1279
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
It mostly works the same way, but there will just be numbers tweaked to the player versions.

1280
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
And the same works as well for the, what do you call it, the virtual sacrifice...

1281
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Headhunter.

1282
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Headhunter and headhunter and stuff like that.

1283
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:47,000
So, yeah.

1284
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
It's player versions of the monster mods for that.

1285
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Yeah.

1286
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
This new attention to these things is going to benefit, like, the pre-existing stuff like Headhunter and that as well.

1287
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Yeah.

1288
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
That's insane.

1289
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
There's a new...

1290
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Probably should have let people discover it.

1291
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
There's a new unique charm that possesses you with a random Asmiri spirit as well.

1292
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
And so you get the daemons and the stats.

1293
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And those technically also have player versions too.

1294
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
But actually, not to necessarily make things worse, to make things better.

1295
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Because monsters are balanced to fight player.

1296
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Player life and monster life not in the same universe.

1297
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So, actually, what we've done is all the things you steal that are monsters and monster skills,

1298
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
like the explosions and the summoning beers and all that,

1299
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
we've actually specifically balanced them way up to be more effective against monster.

1300
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
So, when you steal them, they're much more powerful, actually.

1301
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Just so they're not just tickling monsters and doing 1% of their life kind of thing.

1302
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It was mentioned in chat, actually, the whole, like, Asmiri modifiers and things on stuff.

1303
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
That wouldn't go...

1304
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
That wouldn't transfer over with the companion system, surely?

1305
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
No.

1306
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,000
No, no, no.

1307
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
That would be a little bit too far, perhaps, to get unhinged.

1308
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
We actually had to, because this is certainly a benefit.

1309
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
But once you have tamed the beast, it is not tradable.

1310
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And people might immediately be like, oh, that's sad.

1311
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Well, the issue is, and as much as you might want some of that,

1312
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I'm sure you don't want to be carrying around a whole bunch of tame beasts in your inventory all the time.

1313
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
So that every single time you find a good rare, all of a sudden you have to go and...

1314
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Because it would mean that finding a rare would become a thing.

1315
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Yes, exactly.

1316
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
It's actually, like, this annoying...

1317
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
In order to make the most money, I have to be constantly thinking about and carrying around tame beasts.

1318
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
But then we also made it so that as soon as you activate a beast,

1319
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
then no one who comes into the instance after that is allowed to tame it.

1320
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,000
You can't do any, like...

1321
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
So you can't TFT the, you know, the...

1322
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
It's like a whole...

1323
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
There's a lot of thinking about that stuff in order to make it so that, you know...

1324
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
It's a sad thing to have lost, but it is like, yeah, no, I'm not signing up for that.

1325
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I didn't even think about that.

1326
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Yeah, yeah.

1327
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
The, like, needing for cheat sheets and dives and stuff.

1328
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Yeah, exactly right.

1329
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And so you have to be really careful.

1330
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
You have to be so careful.

1331
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:56,000
You have to be so careful.

1332
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
And the thing is, it's like we design this thing and then think,

1333
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
oh, trading beasts is going to be fun.

1334
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
But then you realise that the horrific reality...

1335
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Actually.

1336
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
...of what it will turn into.

1337
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It's like, yeah, okay, well...

1338
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But yeah, at least we're thinking about that kind of thing,

1339
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
like, with more experience that we have now early so that we don't...

1340
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
We've been on that row before.

1341
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Exactly, exactly.

1342
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Yes, we have.

1343
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1344
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I'm glad we've learned from past issues with that sort of trading.

1345
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

1346
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Fantastic.

1347
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Fantastic.

1348
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
So, talking about some of the other new skills, we had the addition of the Rower,

1349
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
which was a teased quite some time ago, I think.

1350
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
But you've got it in and working now.

1351
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Yes.

1352
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It looks like it's moving around pretty good.

1353
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Yes, yes.

1354
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It's obviously...

1355
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
You've got, like, a big downside.

1356
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
If you get knocked off at a heavy stun and stuff, you can't use melee from it,

1357
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
so it's for ranged attacks.

1358
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

1359
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
But it does seem like one of those things that it's going to be like,

1360
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
everyone's going to use or no one's going to use because it's a clear speed machine.

1361
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,000
It is a concern.

1362
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I mean, look, my ideal situation is that you're using it sometimes

1363
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and not using it other times.

1364
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Like, if you're using it, like, during clear, I think it will, you know,

1365
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
like, you will definitely want to.

1366
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
But it's...

1367
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
We want to just make sure that we've got, like, you know,

1368
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
sort of fun things like that.

1369
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Like, it's just a cool fantasy.

1370
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Like, there's stuff like that that I just want to get in.

1371
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And it's like, you know, look, if it doesn't work later,

1372
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
if we have to nerf it, I mean, sure, I suppose.

1373
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
But, you know, like, I just...

1374
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I want something like that to exist.

1375
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
So, you know, we believe...

1376
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I believe that it is balanced as much as we can do.

1377
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
As much as we can...

1378
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You sound very convinced.

1379
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Yeah, yeah, it's balanced, it's balanced, it's balanced.

1380
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
As I said earlier, you can probably get builds

1381
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
that get to the point of parrying indefinitely.

1382
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
So, you can...

1383
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
That means, there, you can probably get to the point of

1384
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
riding a row indefinitely.

1385
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Sure, sure, sure.

1386
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Again, enough evasion and enough...

1387
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Stagger speaking into and all of that.

1388
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

1389
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Fundamental question, actually.

1390
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Like, what's its move speed based on?

1391
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Its own move speed?

1392
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
The move speed is just your move speed.

1393
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Like, you...

1394
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yeah, but it's...

1395
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
But what you don't get is the penalty

1396
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
for when you attack.

1397
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yeah.

1398
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
So, yeah, that's the thing.

1399
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,000
But it's funny.

1400
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
It's funny, though, because, like,

1401
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
even though it doesn't have a move speed bonus,

1402
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
it feels like you're motoring when you're using it

1403
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
just because of the fact you don't get that downside anymore.

1404
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Like, you feel like you're the fastest thing on the planet.

1405
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
It is.

1406
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
When you're doing it.

1407
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
There are other, like, more mechanical benefits,

1408
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
like, it's considered a companion,

1409
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
which is a kind of subclass of minion that we've added

1410
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
where you can only have one of each minion.

1411
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
One companion base is a keystone for another,

1412
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
but you can only have one of each type.

1413
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
So, like, you can have a tame beast and a rower

1414
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
with the keystone.

1415
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Oh, right, yeah.

1416
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
But inherently, you can only have one companion.

1417
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Right, so you can't use a tame beast

1418
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
if you're using the rower.

1419
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And then there are heaps of passives for, like,

1420
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
if you have a companion,

1421
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
like, companions while they're in your presence

1422
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
and all that kind of stuff,

1423
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
heaps of that stuff around the bottom of the tree.

1424
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Yeah, I saw you guys remade the minion damage,

1425
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
this player damage node on the tree.

1426
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
It's your companion damage nodes become player damage nodes.

1427
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And I was like, oh, that looks like I'm going to take that.

1428
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Well, yeah, so that's the, like, companion

1429
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
where it's, like, more the mercenary over to ranger Huntress

1430
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
is more like, yeah, you want your one powerful minion

1431
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
and benefiting that benefits you and you benefit it

1432
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
and there's that, like, you know, synergy between you

1433
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
and your companions.

1434
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
So, since it is a companion,

1435
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I like the idea of, like, balance-wise,

1436
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
maybe it ends up being that you're, like,

1437
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
map clearing on back, on rower back.

1438
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And then you get to the boss and you dismount,

1439
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
like, you know, old-school mountain knights

1440
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
who would charge in battle and then dismount and fight.

1441
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yep, yep.

1442
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
So, if it ends up like that,

1443
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
that seems like that would be a pretty cool balance for it.

1444
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I think that should be the best way to use it, I believe.

1445
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Yeah, because then you gain access to your dodge roll

1446
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
for the boss fight where you need it.

1447
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And does the rower then kind of do a bit

1448
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
when you're not on it?

1449
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It can attack, but, I mean,

1450
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
it's not exactly a huge damage source or anything.

1451
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
It's certainly better to stay at range.

1452
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It's not the most durable of birds.

1453
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
But it acts as a distraction, maybe it's a support gem.

1454
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's a minion, right?

1455
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Like, it attacks things and does stuff.

1456
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you can support it

1457
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
with minion supports to make it more durable

1458
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and all of that, so, yeah.

1459
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Yeah, I mean, there's the one that's, like,

1460
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
the minion takes 10% of the damage before you do,

1461
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
so, sacrificial bird.

1462
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Yeah, yeah, true.

1463
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Poor little guy.

1464
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
So that sounds, I'm looking forward

1465
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
to playing around with that one then.

1466
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Speaking of 100 new uniques this time,

1467
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
so how many are you aiming for, kind of, in general?

1468
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Is this about really, like, filling that roster out?

1469
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Well, we want to have every base type have a unique

1470
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
for the purposes of chance.

1471
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Outside of boss uniques.

1472
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Outside of boss uniques.

1473
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But we want every base type to have a unique

1474
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
that you can chance.

1475
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Yes.

1476
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And so that was the eventual goal.

1477
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
One of the things, of course, that we had

1478
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
that was sort of a problem in early access

1479
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
is that because of the way, like,

1480
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
because when we were designing uniques,

1481
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
we kind of designed them, like, in order

1482
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
from base type up, just literally,

1483
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
because that's the way the, like,

1484
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
spreadsheets are arranged.

1485
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
It's like, we ended up with all the low-level uniques

1486
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
first, kind of before the either one.

1487
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And it was kind of, it's like,

1488
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
we didn't see that mistake coming.

1489
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Like, it was kind of stupid because, like,

1490
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
We thought we'd get through way more.

1491
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Yeah, we thought we'd get through them all, right?

1492
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
We were like, okay, we'll get all the uniques.

1493
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
And so we designed them all.

1494
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It's like, okay, we'll start working on the art.

1495
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Just go down the list.

1496
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So then we're like, oh, crap.

1497
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,000
You know, now we don't have any,

1498
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
don't have very many in-game uniques.

1499
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
So, yeah, this time we're like, okay,

1500
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
we really need to make sure

1501
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
that in-game uniques are a thing.

1502
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
There's way more of them.

1503
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So the focus really is on getting,

1504
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
making sure there's lots of cool stuff to find.

1505
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
You know, lots of really chase things

1506
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
that you can get.

1507
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
You know, it's not...

1508
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
You discovered the sort order changing

1509
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
in the spreadsheet.

1510
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Yeah, yeah, it does help.

1511
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
But the, so yeah, effectively,

1512
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
yeah, like, you should,

1513
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
it should be a lot better.

1514
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And like, there's lots of cool stuff there.

1515
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And we're just going to keep going with that,

1516
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:26,000
by the way.

1517
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1518
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
100 now, 100 later, 100 next.

1519
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Just keep going.

1520
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Until, well, kind of, honestly,

1521
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
we never really stopped making uniques.

1522
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Like, especially anyone familiar

1523
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
with Path of Exile 1's history

1524
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
is every single expansion

1525
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
since the dawn of time

1526
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
has had new uniques added to it.

1527
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So, you know, there's, you know,

1528
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
a lot there and there's going to be

1529
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
a lot here eventually as well.

1530
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So, yeah.

1531
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
So then let's talk about the idea

1532
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
of like players seeing a unique

1533
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and be like, ah, 1x, you know,

1534
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
that's not very good.

1535
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Where do you guys,

1536
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
what do you guys want uniques

1537
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
to be in Path of Exile 2?

1538
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Like, how powerful should they be?

1539
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
What should they be aiming to do?

1540
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And how should they affect

1541
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
the rares in that slot?

1542
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I mean, it's always a tension

1543
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
because we want rares to still matter.

1544
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Like, we don't want just you,

1545
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
your character to be just

1546
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
only full of uniques.

1547
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
So it really is like the role can,

1548
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
like, can evolve.

1549
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So at the start of the game,

1550
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:15,000
they're really supposed to be

1551
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
more about that.

1552
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Like, so the earlier game uniques

1553
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
are supposed to do two things.

1554
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
One of them is when you find them,

1555
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
they should be powerful

1556
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
for a little while.

1557
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
But then also they have a,

1558
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
some kind of combo thing

1559
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
that you might be able to do

1560
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
with them at endgame.

1561
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
But we don't always know exactly

1562
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
what that might be.

1563
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Like, I mean,

1564
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
we've got sort of ideas, obviously,

1565
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,000
but it's like,

1566
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
we don't necessarily design them

1567
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
to say, okay,

1568
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
this unique definitely has,

1569
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
like, an endgame build

1570
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
that's going to be, like,

1571
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
that's going to be actually strong

1572
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
to do with it.

1573
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And that's because you're kind of

1574
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
putting in things where,

1575
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
you know, later on,

1576
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
some other mechanic might come along

1577
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
or something might happen

1578
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and then people find

1579
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,000
an interesting interaction

1580
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
and that's when the unique

1581
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
kind of comes into its own.

1582
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And I mean,

1583
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
that's the same as, like,

1584
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
magic card design philosophy,

1585
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
that kind of stuff.

1586
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,000
You just put in, like,

1587
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
kind of weird stuff

1588
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
and sort of, you know,

1589
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
maybe you find something.

1590
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
But obviously it can mean

1591
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:01,000
that, like, you know,

1592
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
when people see a new unique,

1593
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
they dismiss it.

1594
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
But then one day

1595
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
they might also be paying

1596
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
vast amounts for it

1597
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
if it becomes a meta build.

1598
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,000
So, you know,

1599
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
but I feel like a game

1600
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
has to have that stuff in it

1601
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
in order to feel like

1602
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
there's lots of interesting ways

1603
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:15,000
to experiment

1604
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
because, like, you know,

1605
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
it's like the feeling

1606
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
of being the first person

1607
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
to discover some new interaction

1608
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
is an amazing thing

1609
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
and then when people see something

1610
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
that, like, feels smart

1611
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
and it's like, you know,

1612
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
if we don't have uniques

1613
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:25,000
that just take chances

1614
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
and do weird shit,

1615
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
we'll never have

1616
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that kind of stuff happen.

1617
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
So, you know.

1618
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
When we're designing a unique,

1619
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
we don't think about,

1620
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
oh, what's the value going to be.

1621
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Yeah.

1622
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
We're not even coming out of it

1623
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
going, like,

1624
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
this is going to be really expensive

1625
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
or this is going to be really cheap.

1626
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Well, in some cases, you know.

1627
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You knew what you were doing

1628
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
with that Herald unique.

1629
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
No, I don't remember.

1630
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It was more of the charm.

1631
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
But that's the thing.

1632
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Are you aiming for the...

1633
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Honestly,

1634
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
someone said the other day

1635
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,000
they were like,

1636
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
a successful unique

1637
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
is one that should be divisive.

1638
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,000
And I was like,

1639
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I agree for the most part,

1640
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
but not every unique

1641
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
should fill that role.

1642
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Some should just be clearly,

1643
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,000
this is powerful,

1644
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I want it for sure.

1645
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
It is going to be on my build.

1646
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,000
And others are like,

1647
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
what can I do with this now?

1648
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And then others are just like,

1649
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:07,000
we don't know

1650
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
if anyone's going to do anything

1651
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
with this,

1652
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:09,000
throw it in.

1653
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And sometimes it doesn't get

1654
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
anything happen with it

1655
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,000
for three years.

1656
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
But we don't know that necessarily.

1657
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:15,000
It's like,

1658
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
let's just take an experiment

1659
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
and throw it in there

1660
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
and let the players

1661
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:18,000
figure that out.

1662
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Yeah,

1663
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I feel like with a lot

1664
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:20,000
of these uniques,

1665
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
you're designing a question.

1666
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
You're just like,

1667
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I'm going to put something

1668
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
that's a little weird.

1669
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Maybe someone will figure that out.

1670
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Well,

1671
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I think as Rishi called it,

1672
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,000
it's a puzzle piece,

1673
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
right?

1674
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Yeah.

1675
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It's just a piece in the puzzle.

1676
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
You put it there

1677
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
and maybe someone

1678
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
will complete the puzzle

1679
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
or half of it.

1680
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Maybe not.

1681
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And then others

1682
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
where it's just like,

1683
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,000
yeah,

1684
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
this is powerful.

1685
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I mean,

1686
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
there are definitely

1687
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:40,000
some Chase uniques

1688
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
in this.

1689
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Yeah,

1690
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,000
100%.

1691
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Oh,

1692
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,000
definitely.

1693
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
So on Chase uniques,

1694
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:47,000
then we've obviously

1695
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
had some pretty crazy

1696
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
ones so far.

1697
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Where do they want to be

1698
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
in terms of how hard

1699
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,000
they are to get

1700
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
for players?

1701
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Because at that point,

1702
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
you do need to consider

1703
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
how expensive they end up being.

1704
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
It's really tricky.

1705
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So whenever we're looking,

1706
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
so if there's a unique

1707
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:01,000
that's broken,

1708
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I guess there's two responses,

1709
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
right?

1710
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:03,000
One of them is

1711
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
make it rare enough

1712
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
that you only get

1713
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
the brokenness

1714
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
after the point

1715
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
when you're,

1716
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,000
at the point

1717
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
where you're supposed

1718
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,000
to get that,

1719
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
which is to say

1720
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
post-pinnacle boss type

1721
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
level of character development,

1722
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,000
right?

1723
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And then the other response

1724
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
would be nerf the actual unique.

1725
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And it honestly

1726
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
is a case-by-case.

1727
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
So I think that

1728
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Temporalus,

1729
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
for example,

1730
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
actually got nerfed

1731
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,000
in both ways.

1732
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
The actual unique

1733
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
was nerfed a little bit,

1734
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I believe,

1735
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,000
although I don't believe

1736
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
it's maybe as much

1737
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
as what players might expect.

1738
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,000
But then also,

1739
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
okay,

1740
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
whatever.

1741
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
But also,

1742
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
we have made that one rarer.

1743
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
It's still pretty crazy.

1744
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Oh, it's still crazy.

1745
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,000
For sure, for sure, for sure.

1746
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
But the thing is,

1747
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
you want to chase stuff,

1748
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
right?

1749
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,000
So therefore,

1750
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
you don't want to just go

1751
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,000
nerfing everything

1752
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
into the ground

1753
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
the moment that it's good.

1754
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
So therefore,

1755
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
that one becoming rarer,

1756
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I think,

1757
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
was the right answer there

1758
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
because it was way too common.

1759
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
We had also the issues

1760
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
with like,

1761
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I mean,

1762
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
there were three real issues.

1763
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
One is darkness

1764
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
at one point

1765
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
bypassed on a loss.

1766
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So all of a sudden,

1767
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
a no-hit run.

1768
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
It wasn't a no-hit run.

1769
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
You had guard bypass

1770
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
on a loss.

1771
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So once again,

1772
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
a no-hit run is not a no-hit run.

1773
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
And then there was just like,

1774
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,000
well,

1775
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
how can anything hit you

1776
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
if you can kill literally

1777
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
everything on your screen

1778
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
in one frame, right?

1779
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
So those three problems.

1780
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And so as the like,

1781
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,000
the balance issue

1782
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
of not everything surviving,

1783
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
things surviving

1784
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
for more than one frame

1785
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
due to a subset of builds

1786
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
and those other two things go away,

1787
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
it becomes a lot rarer in itself.

1788
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Yeah.

1789
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I mean,

1790
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
it is much harder to acquire,

1791
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
require like very specific

1792
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
and ideally high-skill gameplay.

1793
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And then there was just like,

1794
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
well,

1795
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
it also was just too common,

1796
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
the Relic that yielded it.

1797
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I mean,

1798
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
the expectation was that,

1799
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,000
oh,

1800
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
because this is a hard challenge,

1801
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
most of the time

1802
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,000
when people try,

1803
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
they will fail.

1804
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
The reality is

1805
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
once you get the ability to do it,

1806
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
you just trade for that thing

1807
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
and get it every time.

1808
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
So that's kind of meant

1809
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
that the rarity

1810
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
kind of didn't work

1811
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,000
like we thought.

1812
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And yeah,

1813
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
now that should be better

1814
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
in both ways.

1815
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Like again,

1816
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
for the POE 1 player,

1817
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
it's comparison,

1818
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
like it was far more common

1819
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,000
than Original Sin,

1820
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
which was the same role

1821
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
in POE 1's version of the Sanctum,

1822
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
just to give us

1823
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
some sort of comparison.

1824
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's just much easier

1825
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
to actually reliably do it.

1826
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And it shouldn't have been

1827
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
that much more common.

1828
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Right, right.

1829
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Yeah,

1830
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,000
gotcha.

1831
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So crafting really surprised me.

1832
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,000
You guys announced,

1833
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I thought we'd maybe get

1834
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
like one little thing,

1835
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
maybe you'd do something

1836
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
with essences or something,

1837
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
but we've got essences

1838
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
coming out a lot more,

1839
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,000
it looks like.

1840
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:28,000
You've got,

1841
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
because you're violent,

1842
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
you can integrate it now.

1843
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,000
So greater essences

1844
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
are much more,

1845
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
going to be much easier to get.

1846
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
One thing we didn't mention

1847
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
in the video

1848
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
is that like omens

1849
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
are way more common

1850
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
because I believe

1851
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
you made a chance

1852
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,000
that there's an omen

1853
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
in every...

1854
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Two and a half times

1855
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,000
more common,

1856
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I think.

1857
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yeah,

1858
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
than every thing.

1859
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So like you've got

1860
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
stuff like that.

1861
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Like we certainly knew

1862
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
that we needed to do more

1863
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,000
with what crafting stuff.

1864
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And so we're kind of like,

1865
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,000
well,

1866
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
let's just make sure

1867
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,000
we're at least adding,

1868
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
you know,

1869
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
three or four things,

1870
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,000
like new things.

1871
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Every ritual

1872
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
will now have one,

1873
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,000
at least one omen

1874
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
in the window.

1875
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Amazing.

1876
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So you can know

1877
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
upon finishing a ritual,

1878
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,000
you're like,

1879
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
what is the omen I'm going to get

1880
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
and hope it's a good one

1881
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
and maybe most often

1882
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:01,000
it's not,

1883
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
but you know.

1884
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,000
But yeah,

1885
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
the greater essences,

1886
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
obviously,

1887
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,000
yeah,

1888
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,000
the Varlorb thing

1889
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
makes it much more common.

1890
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,000
You know,

1891
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
there's more sources of them

1892
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:07,000
with the map

1893
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
and everything like that.

1894
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
So that'll be happening more.

1895
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And then of course,

1896
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
there's the improvements

1897
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
to things like the runes.

1898
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
We've got higher level mods

1899
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
that you can get from them.

1900
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
There's like a ton more runes.

1901
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,000
There's like,

1902
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,000
you know,

1903
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,000
yeah,

1904
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
like we just wanted

1905
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
to expand the set

1906
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
and having the kind of like,

1907
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
you know,

1908
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,000
the,

1909
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,000
yeah,

1910
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
the nicher mods

1911
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
that you can get

1912
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and craft on things

1913
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,000
like you just,

1914
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,000
yeah,

1915
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,000
just,

1916
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
it just needed more options.

1917
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And yeah,

1918
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
it's sort of interesting

1919
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
because like some people say,

1920
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,000
oh,

1921
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
you don't have crafting

1922
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
in,

1923
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:33,000
you know,

1924
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
in Peewee 2

1925
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
because we don't have

1926
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
a crafting bench.

1927
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:36,000
But it's like,

1928
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
we actually have a huge number

1929
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
of crafting options

1930
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
and the crafting being good

1931
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
kind of comes down

1932
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,000
to like how many

1933
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
of these kind of weird systems

1934
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:42,000
are there

1935
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
and how they can interact.

1936
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But we just have to be

1937
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
really careful

1938
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:45,000
because,

1939
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:45,000
you know,

1940
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
like you don't want

1941
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
to get to the point

1942
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
where ground items

1943
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
no longer matter.

1944
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Like you,

1945
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
and I think Peewee 1

1946
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,000
kind of basically

1947
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
did get to that point

1948
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
for various reasons

1949
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
where like people

1950
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,000
aren't caring

1951
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
about what's on the ground

1952
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:57,000
nearly as much.

1953
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
So we still want

1954
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
to make sure

1955
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,000
with every change

1956
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,000
we're making

1957
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
that,

1958
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:01,000
you know,

1959
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
they still use

1960
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:02,000
the ground stuff,

1961
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:03,000
that you're still excited

1962
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
for things on the ground.

1963
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And so that's like

1964
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
a really careful balancing act

1965
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
because they do directly

1966
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
contravene each other.

1967
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Like the more,

1968
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
the better stuff you can craft,

1969
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:11,000
the less important

1970
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
the ground stuff is.

1971
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:12,000
So you kind of,

1972
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:13,000
it's a really sort of

1973
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
subtle balancing act.

1974
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
But yeah,

1975
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I think that the stuff

1976
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:16,000
we've added here

1977
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
will definitely push things

1978
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
in a way where you feel

1979
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
like there's more smart things

1980
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,000
that you can do

1981
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
to kind of improve your stuff.

1982
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Yeah,

1983
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
well I think done right

1984
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
and what you're doing

1985
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
is making sure

1986
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
that the ground items

1987
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
do matter with each

1988
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
of these crafting systems.

1989
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
So you have

1990
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,000
that fundamental change

1991
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
where you can't just

1992
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
turn an item back

1993
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
into a wide item.

1994
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Exactly.

1995
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
And that's very important.

1996
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
One of the biggest ones I think.

1997
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And that kind of then

1998
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
unlocks the ability

1999
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
to do more.

2000
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And so the great thing

2001
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
about the socketables

2002
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,000
as a crafting system

2003
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
is that they don't

2004
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
compromise the ground at all

2005
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
because they don't,

2006
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,000
you know,

2007
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
they're on top of the stuff

2008
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
that you can get on the ground.

2009
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
So that's very good.

2010
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:48,000
But when it comes

2011
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
to the kind of the base mods

2012
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
we do want to retain,

2013
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
like, you know,

2014
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,000
that an item has,

2015
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
we do want to retain

2016
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
for the most part

2017
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
the kind of thing

2018
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
of like those,

2019
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
that part of the item generation

2020
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
is random.

2021
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It's just that,

2022
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
and it's just that

2023
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
on top of that

2024
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
you get the more deterministic

2025
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,000
things that you can add

2026
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
in addition to.

2027
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
And then when you do it

2028
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
that way it works really well.

2029
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
So socketables work really well

2030
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
as a crafting system

2031
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:07,000
for that reason.

2032
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
So on that topic

2033
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
we've had this,

2034
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
talking to you

2035
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
it's like you're always

2036
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
saying to me that like

2037
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
this rune system

2038
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
is our crafting bench

2039
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
but players don't

2040
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
keep asking for a bench anyway.

2041
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Right, right, right.

2042
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So obviously there's like

2043
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
a branding issue

2044
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
or a functionality gap there.

2045
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
It is funny

2046
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:23,000
because I was actually

2047
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
saying the other day

2048
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
that like

2049
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
if we had literally

2050
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:27,000
had that system

2051
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
be identical

2052
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
except that the way

2053
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:29,000
it was themed

2054
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
was that there's

2055
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,000
a crafting bench

2056
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
you go to

2057
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:31,000
and craft extra mods

2058
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
on the items

2059
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
which literally

2060
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:34,000
would be functionally

2061
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
the same

2062
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
and required materials

2063
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
that are effectively

2064
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
the runes that you get

2065
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
then I feel like

2066
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
people would be thinking

2067
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:41,000
that we've got

2068
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
a crafting bench

2069
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,000
but yeah,

2070
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
ultimately that is

2071
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
that the rune system

2072
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
the socketables

2073
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
are what replaced

2074
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000
the crafting bench

2075
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
and the POE1

2076
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
style crafting bench.

2077
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I guess it must have

2078
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:50,000
also been like

2079
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
with that initial

2080
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
kind of output

2081
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:52,000
of them

2082
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
was just not as many

2083
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
options as

2084
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
100% as well

2085
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:56,000
so that is the issue

2086
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:56,000
and that's because

2087
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
they were relatively

2088
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
late in development

2089
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
so now we're just

2090
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
sort of expanding that

2091
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
and we'll continue

2092
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
to add more socketables

2093
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
probably with every release

2094
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
right, like

2095
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
we'll add more categories

2096
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
and we'll do different things

2097
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
it's like expanding

2098
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
the kind of type of mods

2099
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
because there is a thing

2100
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
where it's the more

2101
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
like in the base

2102
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
mod pool for items

2103
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
there can only be things

2104
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
that are really fundamental

2105
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
and so anything

2106
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:15,000
that's kind of out there

2107
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
we don't want to put

2108
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
in the base mod pool

2109
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:17,000
because then you end up

2110
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
in this sort of situation

2111
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
where you get items

2112
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
and they've got random shit

2113
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,000
you don't care about

2114
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
like the crafting

2115
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
is where you want to have

2116
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
all of the kind of stuff

2117
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
that's like very build specific

2118
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
and so adding more mods

2119
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,000
to that pool

2120
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
so that you can do that

2121
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
is the right idea.

2122
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Why is it that

2123
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
you can't

2124
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
socket and ruin some things?

2125
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Like non-attack weapons

2126
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:36,000
for example?

2127
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Well

2128
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
it was more just a choice

2129
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
for asymmetry

2130
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,000
where we just wanted

2131
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
these things to feel different

2132
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
there was also just like

2133
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
a little bit of a like

2134
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
in the future

2135
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
we'll add some system

2136
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
where we can do

2137
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:48,000
something else there

2138
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
and so just not having

2139
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
everything be completely identical

2140
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
much like how

2141
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,000
you know

2142
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
the quality on those weapons

2143
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
works differently

2144
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
where it affects the skill

2145
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
as opposed to just

2146
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,000
you know

2147
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
base damage

2148
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I do think it is something

2149
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
that we should be

2150
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,000
probably looking into

2151
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
sooner rather than later though

2152
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Yeah

2153
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
because the asymmetry things

2154
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
it's good to have

2155
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
like not everything

2156
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:07,000
be super homogenous

2157
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
but

2158
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
because we're talking

2159
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
about the importance

2160
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
of it being that

2161
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
extra layer of

2162
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
control of your items

2163
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,000
which you just don't have

2164
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
if you're doing spellcasting

2165
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Maybe we'll add an

2166
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Arcanist's bench

2167
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
and theme it that way

2168
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
for those ones

2169
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Alright

2170
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
you forced my hand

2171
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I have to bring this up now

2172
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
can we get some sort of

2173
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
like cohesive

2174
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
all in one

2175
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
bench for disenchanting

2176
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:27,000
salvaging

2177
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
selling for gold

2178
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Arcanist benching

2179
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
at endgame

2180
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I get in the campaign

2181
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
having these things

2182
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:33,000
be separate

2183
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
but like at endgame

2184
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
it's so much

2185
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
clicky clicky

2186
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,000
easy work

2187
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
happy enough with them

2188
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
just being next to each other

2189
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
putting them next to each other

2190
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:40,000
and you know

2191
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:40,000
No

2192
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Alright

2193
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I'll think about that one

2194
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Okay good

2195
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I planted the seeds at least

2196
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Yeah yeah

2197
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I've done my part

2198
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Alright

2199
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
There's ways

2200
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
There's ways

2201
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I like the

2202
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
sounds of that

2203
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Well at least for endgame

2204
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Yeah

2205
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I don't want the world

2206
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
to not feel like

2207
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
it makes sense

2208
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Absolutely

2209
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Endgame you've got your

2210
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,000
hideout

2211
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
It would have to be

2212
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
a hideout related thing

2213
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Yeah yeah yeah

2214
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:07,000
That makes sense

2215
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I mean

2216
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
people are putting their

2217
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
NPCs within each other's

2218
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
personal space anyway

2219
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
so the lore goes out the

2220
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
window at that point

2221
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Yeah for sure

2222
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
So we've also got

2223
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Fractured

2224
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Crafted Veer and Orb

2225
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
from the cleansed monsters

2226
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
How rare are those?

2227
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
How do you quantify

2228
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
rarity like that?

2229
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
They drop from the monsters

2230
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I can't remember the exact

2231
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
number but like

2232
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I think I was kind of

2233
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
saying like one per biome

2234
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
which is the kind of

2235
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
total blob of

2236
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
cleansed monsters

2237
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
but then that obviously

2238
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
does get affected by

2239
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
things like pack size

2240
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
and all that on top of

2241
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,000
that

2242
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
So is that like five

2243
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
maps or something?

2244
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Well it depends on how

2245
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
many of them you kill

2246
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:45,000
as corrupted

2247
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Yeah

2248
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Because like

2249
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
because there's the

2250
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
ones you didn't

2251
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
that you didn't

2252
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
cleanse while you were

2253
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
you know getting to the

2254
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
nexus

2255
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
those are the ones

2256
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,000
that then become

2257
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
cleansed

2258
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
so you kind of have to

2259
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:56,000
choose like when you go

2260
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
into a biome I'm going

2261
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
to beeline straight for

2262
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,000
the nexus

2263
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
and then cleanse

2264
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,000
everything

2265
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
or am I going to just

2266
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,000
fight them all as

2267
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
corrupted to get the

2268
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:02,000
rewards from that?

2269
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:03,000
So you're kind of

2270
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
choosing one reward or

2271
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,000
the other based on

2272
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
what you decide to run

2273
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Okay so you can kind of

2274
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
leave the nexus for last

2275
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,000
if you want to

2276
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Yes if you want to

2277
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
choose it to try and

2278
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
get more fractured orbs

2279
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Oh no it's the other

2280
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:12,000
way around

2281
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
So do nexus first

2282
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
then it cleanses all the

2283
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
maps and then now you

2284
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
can get the most chance

2285
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
at fractured orbs

2286
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
or you can fight them

2287
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
corrupted before going

2288
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
to the nexus if you

2289
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
want to get the rewards

2290
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
that the corrupted maps

2291
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:23,000
have

2292
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:23,000
And we have like

2293
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
for example the

2294
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
corrupted bosses have

2295
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
their own uniques now

2296
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Yeah so you're going to

2297
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
There's a bunch of

2298
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
new modifiers and how

2299
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
they you know so

2300
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,000
there's like random

2301
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
corrupted strongbox kind

2302
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
of things and all that

2303
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
stuff so you kind of

2304
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
really are like I'm

2305
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
going to you know have

2306
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
a look at the mods

2307
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I like this I'm going to

2308
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
do this then this then

2309
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
this then the nexus and

2310
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
then I'm going to do the

2311
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
rest cleansed

2312
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Does the cleansed boss

2313
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,000
have its own uniques as

2314
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,000
well?

2315
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Not yet

2316
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Not yet

2317
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
It does have

2318
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It guarantees a fractured

2319
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
although as well

2320
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Oh okay

2321
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
So you can get the

2322
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Yes the boss

2323
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
And you'll display

2324
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
If you hover over the

2325
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
map and it says like

2326
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
contains I can't remember

2327
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,000
his name

2328
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Then you run it and

2329
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
kill it you will get a

2330
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
fractured orb so at

2331
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
least you will know that

2332
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:02,000
will drop one

2333
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Yeah yeah

2334
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
So with the fractured

2335
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
orbs being away

2336
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
fracturing that's

2337
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
obviously super powerful

2338
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,000
for crafting

2339
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Are there any fractured

2340
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
items dropping pre-fractured?

2341
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I quite liked that

2342
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I think we went with no

2343
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:14,000
in the end

2344
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Yeah not currently

2345
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
We were going to do it

2346
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
but then we decided not

2347
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,000
to but we might do it

2348
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,000
later

2349
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Yeah so an extra item

2350
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Is there a particular

2351
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
reason for it or

2352
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:20,000
the thought process?

2353
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:21,000
There just kind of

2354
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
wasn't anything that

2355
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
really fit that exactly

2356
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I think

2357
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
At some point you'll want

2358
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
some new thing

2359
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Yeah probably

2360
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Personally I would

2361
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
rather just drop more

2362
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:31,000
orbs

2363
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Honestly let people

2364
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
choose how they want

2365
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
to use them

2366
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
I like it from the

2367
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
perspective of dropped

2368
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
items matter

2369
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
like when you're seeing

2370
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:38,000
a rare

2371
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Yeah but they kind of

2372
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
already do

2373
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
they kind of do here

2374
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
anyway because

2375
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
because you need that

2376
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
as the thing of the

2377
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
fractured

2378
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:44,000
so it's kind of

2379
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
not necessary I think

2380
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
There's other little

2381
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
subtle things like

2382
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
for example

2383
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
the cleansed monsters

2384
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
within cleansed maps

2385
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
can't drop equipment

2386
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
as a little thing

2387
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:54,000
so they have much

2388
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
higher

2389
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,000
obviously they're

2390
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
dropping things

2391
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
more like

2392
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
waystones, tablets,

2393
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,000
currency

2394
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
they don't get to

2395
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
drop any of the

2396
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
armor or anything

2397
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,000
so they're more

2398
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
like currency sources

2399
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
as like an

2400
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
interesting subtle thing

2401
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:05,000
If you want more

2402
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
currency then play

2403
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
cleansed maps

2404
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
So we're going to

2405
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,000
have a lot more

2406
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
essences, a lot more

2407
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:10,000
omens, potential

2408
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
ability to get

2409
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
fractured, recombination

2410
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
with the new

2411
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
more accessible

2412
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
at low and mid tier

2413
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,000
recombination

2414
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Design 4.0

2415
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
This is

2416
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
yes recombination

2417
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,000
has certainly

2418
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
undergone some changes

2419
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
This is a huge

2420
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:24,000
huge leap forwards

2421
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
compared to

2422
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
0.1's crafting

2423
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
So was it just about

2424
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
that you had to

2425
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
establish that really

2426
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
like humble baseline

2427
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:31,000
for crafting

2428
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
so that you could

2429
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
then go crazy

2430
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Honestly I mean

2431
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,000
look on some level

2432
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
it can just be

2433
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
you know like

2434
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
you need an economy

2435
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
you need to see

2436
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:38,000
how things evolve

2437
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
you know we just

2438
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:39,000
don't want to do

2439
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
too much at once

2440
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I mean although

2441
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:41,000
this may seem

2442
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
like quite a lot

2443
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,000
It does yeah

2444
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
But the thing is

2445
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,000
is like

2446
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
but in terms of

2447
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
the initial system

2448
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
it's like if we'd

2449
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:46,000
have had all that

2450
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
at the start

2451
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I think that we

2452
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:48,000
wouldn't have been

2453
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
like you know

2454
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
we'll put it this way

2455
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
it is hard to take

2456
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
this stuff away

2457
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,000
so that's why

2458
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
we have to be

2459
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
a little bit careful

2460
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
as we do this

2461
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Yeah I guess you

2462
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
needed to kind of

2463
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
assess the fundamental

2464
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:57,000
things like the

2465
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
no scours

2466
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,000
the no bolts

2467
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
and stuff like that

2468
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
as well

2469
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
because then you

2470
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
can have a better

2471
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:02,000
idea of how to

2472
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
build off that

2473
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
which I'm super

2474
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:04,000
excited for

2475
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
crafting

2476
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Oh yeah

2477
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Oh you're going to

2478
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,000
have a new craft

2479
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
for every league

2480
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,000
right that's how

2481
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
it is these days

2482
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Oh yeah

2483
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I expect a crafting

2484
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
system for every league

2485
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,000
thank you

2486
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Something like that

2487
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
that's somewhat

2488
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
actually our intention

2489
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:19,000
so

2490
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I love it

2491
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
love it

2492
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,000
perfect

2493
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
so let's talk

2494
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
about Endgame

2495
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
then because that

2496
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
had some humble

2497
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
origins as well

2498
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,000
with the initial

2499
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
implementation of

2500
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:29,000
P.O.E. 2's

2501
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Endgame

2502
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,000
obviously trying

2503
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
some new things

2504
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
being a bit

2505
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,000
experimental

2506
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
not necessarily

2507
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
just wanting to

2508
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,000
copy P.O.E. 1's

2509
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Endgame

2510
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,000
but how far

2511
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
if your vision

2512
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
was 0.1's

2513
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Endgame

2514
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:38,000
was it

2515
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
what you want

2516
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I would say

2517
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,000
that the main

2518
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
problem that we

2519
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
had is there

2520
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,000
wasn't enough

2521
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
overlapping axes

2522
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
of randomness

2523
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:44,000
as we call them

2524
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
where effectively

2525
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
you need to have

2526
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
it so that when

2527
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:47,000
you go into

2528
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:47,000
a map

2529
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
there's just

2530
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
chances for

2531
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,000
random shit

2532
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
occurring

2533
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
and then

2534
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
that random

2535
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,000
shit

2536
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
might happen

2537
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
alongside some

2538
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
other random

2539
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,000
shit

2540
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
and now the

2541
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:56,000
thing together

2542
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
is a new

2543
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,000
scenario

2544
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
so effectively

2545
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
if you look

2546
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:01,000
at what we

2547
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
actually added

2548
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
here in terms

2549
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:03,000
of encounters

2550
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
whatever that

2551
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
means to you

2552
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
we've added

2553
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
more than 40

2554
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,000
probably something

2555
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
approaching 50

2556
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
encounters

2557
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:09,000
and that's

2558
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
if you count

2559
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
things like

2560
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:11,000
each rogue

2561
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
exile is a

2562
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:12,000
separate one

2563
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
and each

2564
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:13,000
spirit is a

2565
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
different one

2566
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
so those are

2567
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:15,000
the things

2568
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
but

2569
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:16,000
the big

2570
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
difference

2571
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:17,000
between the

2572
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:17,000
ones we had

2573
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
before and

2574
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:18,000
the ones we

2575
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
have now

2576
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:19,000
is that most

2577
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
of these ones

2578
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
can overlap

2579
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:21,000
with other

2580
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
things

2581
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:22,000
so you have

2582
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
a situation

2583
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
where you've

2584
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:24,000
got the

2585
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Asmary Wisp

2586
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
that happens

2587
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:27,000
to infect

2588
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
the unique

2589
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
boss of the

2590
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:29,000
area

2591
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
and then that

2592
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,000
leads to a

2593
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
combat situation

2594
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:31,000
that you haven't

2595
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:31,000
had to deal

2596
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
with before

2597
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
or then you've

2598
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,000
got some

2599
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
essence thing

2600
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
that oh crap

2601
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
this other

2602
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
wisp caused

2603
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
the thing to

2604
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,000
turn into a

2605
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
boss

2606
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
it's all that

2607
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:42,000
stuff combining

2608
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
what happens

2609
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
when this goes

2610
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:44,000
with the unique

2611
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
strongbox

2612
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,000
and it's

2613
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
all that

2614
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,000
combining

2615
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,000
stuff

2616
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
and that's

2617
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:47,000
what leads

2618
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
to the

2619
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,000
situation

2620
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,000
where you've

2621
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
got an

2622
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:49,000
exponential

2623
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
explosion

2624
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
of possible

2625
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:51,000
combat

2626
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
situations

2627
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:52,000
and then

2628
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
sometimes you

2629
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
just run

2630
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:54,000
into stuff

2631
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:54,000
that you've

2632
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:54,000
never seen

2633
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
before because

2634
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,000
of that

2635
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,000
because of

2636
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
this combined

2637
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:56,000
in some

2638
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:56,000
interesting

2639
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
way

2640
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,000
and that's

2641
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
something that

2642
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:58,000
definitely

2643
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
POE 1 has

2644
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
got very well

2645
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,000
because it's

2646
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
got so many

2647
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,000
of these things

2648
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,000
that have been

2649
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
added over time

2650
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
and it's also

2651
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:03,000
something that we

2652
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
took care to make

2653
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,000
sure that each

2654
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
league specifically

2655
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
did

2656
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
so what

2657
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
POE 2 lacked

2658
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
was I think

2659
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,000
that

2660
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
and so that

2661
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,000
will mean I

2662
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
think that the

2663
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,000
end game is

2664
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
overall just much

2665
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:13,000
more engaging

2666
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
obviously we're

2667
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,000
going to be

2668
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,000
adding more

2669
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
content and

2670
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
more of the

2671
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,000
other stuff

2672
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
but fundamentally

2673
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
it was specifically

2674
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
more of that

2675
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
type of stuff

2676
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
that we needed

2677
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:21,000
to do

2678
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
and honestly

2679
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I don't think

2680
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
we've even got

2681
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:23,000
enough yet

2682
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
we want even

2683
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,000
more

2684
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
we'll keep on

2685
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,000
adding that

2686
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
stuff but it

2687
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:27,000
needed to become

2688
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
a focus

2689
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
and I think

2690
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
part of the

2691
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,000
reason is that

2692
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,000
when we're first

2693
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
working on the

2694
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,000
end game

2695
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
it's like we need

2696
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,000
to come up with

2697
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
the big ticket

2698
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:36,000
items

2699
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
what are the

2700
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
league things

2701
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,000
and the maps

2702
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
we need to

2703
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:39,000
come up with

2704
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:39,000
all that stuff

2705
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
it's the little

2706
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
detaily things

2707
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
that require a

2708
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
bit more time

2709
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
and stuff to

2710
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:46,000
work on

2711
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
even though

2712
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
they're actually

2713
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
relatively efficient

2714
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
to make

2715
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,000
we can make a

2716
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
lot of them

2717
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:51,000
when we do

2718
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
sit down and

2719
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:52,000
design them

2720
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
making a new

2721
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,000
strongbox

2722
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
sure it's work

2723
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:56,000
but it doesn't

2724
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
take that long

2725
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
but it is

2726
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
that stuff that

2727
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,000
adds all the

2728
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
flavour and interest

2729
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
so we'll just

2730
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
be continuing to

2731
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,000
do that through

2732
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
the game

2733
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
even yesterday

2734
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:05,000
we were having

2735
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
a conversation

2736
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
about making

2737
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:07,000
it so more

2738
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
of the maps

2739
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,000
even just

2740
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
regular maps

2741
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
have more

2742
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
interesting little

2743
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
things that

2744
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,000
happen in them

2745
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
more like what

2746
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
the campaign

2747
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:15,000
has

2748
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
so we haven't

2749
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
got there yet

2750
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
but through

2751
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:19,000
early access

2752
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
we'll definitely

2753
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
be introducing

2754
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
more of those

2755
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
little details

2756
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:23,000
everywhere so

2757
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
you get the

2758
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,000
interesting things

2759
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,000
happening

2760
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
so a bit like

2761
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
those exploration

2762
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
mechanics in

2763
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
campaigns

2764
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:28,000
100%

2765
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
we just want

2766
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
to make sure

2767
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
you feel that

2768
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,000
same way

2769
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
through the

2770
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:32,000
end game

2771
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:32,000
as well

2772
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
and with

2773
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:33,000
the leagues

2774
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
as well

2775
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
and like

2776
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
there's really

2777
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,000
only so much

2778
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
randomness that

2779
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
can occur within

2780
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:39,000
a breach in a

2781
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
map and so they

2782
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:40,000
will end up

2783
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
feeling ultra

2784
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:41,000
repetitive

2785
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
whereas

2786
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
again in

2787
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Piri 1 you

2788
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,000
had the boss

2789
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,000
that could

2790
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
spawn occasionally

2791
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
you had five

2792
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:46,000
different factions

2793
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
you know things

2794
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
like that and

2795
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
it is very much

2796
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
our intention to

2797
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:50,000
expand on all

2798
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
the leagues to

2799
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:51,000
have way more

2800
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
random things

2801
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,000
occurring

2802
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
mini bosses

2803
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:53,000
spawning

2804
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
whatever else

2805
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
you know I

2806
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
have a whole set

2807
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I don't want to

2808
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
spoil them all yet

2809
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,000
because that's

2810
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
a whole later

2811
01:39:59,000 --> 01:39:59,000
thing but

2812
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
definitely want to

2813
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
expand on all

2814
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
that you know

2815
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
even expedition

2816
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
only has the

2817
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
one boss

2818
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
it had four

2819
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
in the

2820
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,000
predecessor

2821
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
you know like

2822
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
we need to

2823
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
get back to

2824
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,000
having all of

2825
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
that depth

2826
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
of combat

2827
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:14,000
and all of

2828
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
those mechanics

2829
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
and it will

2830
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
help hugely

2831
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
while also

2832
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,000
making sure

2833
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
we're adding

2834
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,000
new ones of

2835
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
course but

2836
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:20,000
what we

2837
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
definitely have

2838
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,000
learned is

2839
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,000
that our

2840
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
minimum

2841
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
standard for

2842
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:23,000
new ones

2843
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:23,000
is going to

2844
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
have to

2845
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:24,000
it should

2846
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
include all

2847
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:25,000
of these

2848
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:25,000
things from

2849
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
the get-go

2850
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:26,000
right

2851
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
otherwise we're

2852
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
just signing

2853
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:28,000
ourselves up

2854
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
for like here's

2855
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,000
a thousand

2856
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,000
things we need

2857
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
to improve

2858
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
it'd be nice

2859
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
to actually get

2860
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:32,000
some of them

2861
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
finished so

2862
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:33,000
that's going to

2863
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
be a goal

2864
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:34,000
going forward

2865
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:34,000
for sure

2866
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
but I think

2867
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:35,000
it's like it

2868
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
is where our

2869
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
type of design

2870
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
shines because

2871
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
like adding

2872
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
content is no

2873
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
longer a process

2874
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
of like you

2875
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,000
know we work

2876
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,000
on a thing

2877
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
and then the

2878
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:43,000
players get to

2879
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
play you know

2880
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
like it gets

2881
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
into a situation

2882
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
where like adding

2883
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
content is more

2884
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,000
value than just

2885
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
the content

2886
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
itself it like

2887
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,000
because it adds

2888
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
to everything else

2889
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:51,000
too and so

2890
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
that kind of

2891
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:52,000
makes it feel

2892
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
like the world

2893
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
gets like larger

2894
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
in much larger

2895
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:55,000
proportion than

2896
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:55,000
what you have

2897
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
and so like

2898
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
you know it's

2899
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:57,000
an n squared

2900
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
thing where like

2901
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
you know yeah

2902
01:40:59,000 --> 01:40:59,000
the square of

2903
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
all the stuff

2904
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,000
we add so

2905
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
like basically

2906
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
it'll feel like

2907
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
it's ramping up

2908
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,000
in terms of

2909
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
interest as we

2910
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:05,000
add more content

2911
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
rather than just

2912
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
feeling like you're

2913
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,000
just continuing

2914
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
like every

2915
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
rather than every

2916
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:09,000
leafing like you

2917
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
just add the

2918
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:10,000
same amount

2919
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:10,000
it'll feel like

2920
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
it gets even

2921
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
bigger each time

2922
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:12,000
yeah when you

2923
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
add as merri-wisps

2924
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
that's not just

2925
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:15,000
about adding that

2926
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
it interacts with

2927
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
all the other

2928
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:17,000
things that already

2929
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
exist that it can

2930
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
exactly go ahead

2931
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:19,000
and effect

2932
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
so that's tackling

2933
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:21,000
one of the

2934
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
ultimately I think

2935
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
the biggest things

2936
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
is just that like

2937
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,000
the core

2938
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
mapping of running

2939
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:26,000
an empty map

2940
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
was boring

2941
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:28,000
and that's never

2942
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
what you want to

2943
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,000
be obviously

2944
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
so like some

2945
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:32,000
of the issues

2946
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
there I guess

2947
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:33,000
as well that

2948
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
were exacerbated

2949
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
by that problem

2950
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
was the fact that

2951
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:36,000
the maps were so

2952
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
big and that there

2953
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
were so many of

2954
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:38,000
them obviously

2955
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
that's getting a

2956
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:39,000
lot better with

2957
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
the maps themselves

2958
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
becoming much

2959
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
more interesting

2960
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
but it seems like

2961
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:45,000
this corruption

2962
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
and cleansing

2963
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
mechanic is

2964
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
breaking up and

2965
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,000
giving you something

2966
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
to progress through

2967
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
as you move

2968
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:51,000
towards the next

2969
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
tower or next

2970
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
boss or next

2971
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
other mechanic

2972
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I mean I guess

2973
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
there's always

2974
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
something on your

2975
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:57,000
screen that you're

2976
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
pushing towards

2977
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,000
it looks like

2978
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
well we want to

2979
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
try and

2980
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
honestly I don't

2981
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:01,000
even think we're

2982
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
even quite there

2983
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
yet like we really

2984
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
want to make it so

2985
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
that you feel like

2986
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,000
there's lots of

2987
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
quests as it were

2988
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,000
in endgame like not

2989
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
necessarily directly in

2990
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
the form of like here

2991
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
is a quest objective

2992
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
but like yeah but you

2993
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,000
sort of have this

2994
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
feeling of like yeah

2995
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,000
there's like different

2996
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
stuff that you're

2997
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
like that you feel

2998
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
like oh there's a

2999
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:15,000
thing you know like

3000
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
exactly right you need

3001
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
to ideally like every

3002
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
time you do one of

3003
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:18,000
those it's like

3004
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
there's another one

3005
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
just on the horizon

3006
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:20,000
that you're thinking

3007
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
about so yeah if we

3008
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
can achieve that then

3009
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:23,000
then we'll have

3010
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
succeeded but yeah

3011
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
it'll keep adding

3012
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:26,000
stuff right like just

3013
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
more and more things

3014
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
because obviously you

3015
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
know you need to have

3016
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
enough just core there

3017
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
to be able to get to

3018
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
the point of it

3019
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:32,000
doesn't feel like

3020
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
you're just repeating

3021
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:33,000
the same thing over

3022
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
and over again as

3023
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
well it seemed like

3024
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
this like explorable

3025
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
world map thing that

3026
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
you did for endgame

3027
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
being like looking like

3028
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
a physical actual map

3029
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
was really wanting us to

3030
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
explore but that wasn't

3031
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
really much of that so

3032
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
you kind of yeah well

3033
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I mean ideally we can

3034
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
it's just about content

3035
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
really at that point

3036
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:49,000
you know you just

3037
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
need to add more and

3038
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
more and we'll keep

3039
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
on adding more and

3040
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:52,000
this should this

3041
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
yeah and zero to

3042
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:54,000
oh I think there's a

3043
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
long way to improving

3044
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
that for sure so with

3045
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,000
the corruption mechanic

3046
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
now you're going to

3047
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
see some corruption on

3048
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:58,000
the map and you're

3049
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
going to want to go

3050
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
there because it's a

3051
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
system that you can

3052
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:01,000
interact with

3053
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
exactly it's your

3054
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
skill points yes

3055
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
yes so you're

3056
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:04,000
unlocking skill points

3057
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
from that which means

3058
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
you're unlocking more of

3059
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
the atlas tree earlier

3060
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
on your first nexus

3061
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
you have to run out a

3062
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
tier one map and it

3063
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
will drop two skill

3064
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:13,000
points it'll give you

3065
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
your two first two

3066
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
skill points awesome and

3067
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
then you're like all

3068
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
right where's my next

3069
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
nexus that's where I'm

3070
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
going for my next two

3071
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,000
and then your next one

3072
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
your next one and you

3073
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
have to do them one

3074
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
tier higher every time

3075
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:22,000
so you're the second

3076
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
one you go to at tier

3077
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
two to get your skill

3078
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
points and so on and

3079
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
so forth it's not just

3080
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
it's not just grind 10

3081
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
maps yeah that was

3082
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
that was terrible

3083
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
good good I love it

3084
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
so yeah it is very much

3085
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,000
like let's go and

3086
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
clear these corrupted

3087
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
nexus and then it's

3088
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
like well and there's

3089
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
the whole mechanic around

3090
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
it but yeah if you want

3091
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
to just like fall I want

3092
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
to get my points as

3093
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
fast as possible just go

3094
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
nexus to nexus to

3095
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
nexus and get as many as

3096
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
you can if you're like

3097
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:46,000
oh I can't see any

3098
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
nexus maybe go to a

3099
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
tower to reveal more

3100
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
and then you know what

3101
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
you're doing way less

3102
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
frequently mind you thank

3103
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
goodness yes but yeah

3104
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
it's a lot more

3105
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
objective driven as

3106
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
opposed to just again

3107
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
random grind and random

3108
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
exploration there's at

3109
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
least and you should be

3110
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
seeing a pretty decent

3111
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
chunk of unique maps

3112
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I was gonna ask yeah

3113
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I call them unique maps

3114
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
yeah it's funny because I

3115
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:07,000
was pointing out the

3116
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
other day the distinction

3117
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
between a unique map and

3118
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
a normal like there is

3119
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:11,000
no distinction anymore we

3120
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
shouldn't even look at

3121
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
that way like it should be

3122
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
that every map is like

3123
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
unique in some sense

3124
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
there's not a unique map

3125
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
we do have an icon for

3126
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
it because they are kind

3127
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
of in a different echelon

3128
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
but yes technically

3129
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
unique map is a name

3130
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
that's a holdover for

3131
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Imperial 1

3132
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
yeah because they can

3133
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
you can use mods with

3134
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:28,000
them with waystones

3135
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
anyway so there's no

3136
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
actual reason for you

3137
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
to be any different than

3138
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
a normal map

3139
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
you can craft it and

3140
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
enhance it and juice it

3141
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
it really just comes down

3142
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:35,000
to how rare they are

3143
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
relative to other things

3144
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
right and how rare are

3145
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
they how like

3146
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I mean uh

3147
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
maybe in terms of

3148
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
player screen

3149
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
yeah I mean look

3150
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
as I said I think

3151
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:45,000
how many screens

3152
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
um how many uh

3153
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I had the numbers

3154
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I just don't remember

3155
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,000
them um

3156
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
well I mean as I said

3157
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
they should be common

3158
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
enough that you feel

3159
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,000
like there's always some

3160
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
kind of objective you're

3161
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
excited about

3162
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
honestly

3163
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
more common than I was

3164
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
initially comfortable with

3165
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
and then after trying it

3166
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I was like okay actually

3167
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:02,000
this is like

3168
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
yeah this is this is

3169
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
reasonable so

3170
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
yeah I feel like you

3171
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
initially probably want

3172
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
them to be common

3173
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
enough that you're like

3174
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
almost getting tired of

3175
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
those map layouts so

3176
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
then you're incentivized

3177
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:12,000
to add more

3178
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
the good thing is by the

3179
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
way by adding more here

3180
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
we didn't just keep them

3181
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
the same commonality as

3182
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
the two that existed

3183
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
yeah like they are just

3184
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
more common um it's not

3185
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
like the reason part of

3186
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
the reason the it wasn't

3187
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
as common before is

3188
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
because there was only two

3189
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
and yeah that would have

3190
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
just been repetitive and

3191
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
boring um one of the

3192
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
other restrictions is

3193
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
that like um the vault of

3194
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
kamasa was restricted to

3195
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
the val city biomes

3196
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
so to speak and that

3197
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
was one of the citadel

3198
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
biomes that's like one

3199
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
of the rarest and latest

3200
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
you know so it's like

3201
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
we've not only made that

3202
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
more common within that

3203
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
biome but a lot of the

3204
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
new one in fact all of

3205
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:47,000
the new ones aren't

3206
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
restricted to those city

3207
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
biomes and thus they are

3208
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
appearing more frequently

3209
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
and some of them are like

3210
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
oh you want deserts

3211
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
because they give you the

3212
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
essence map or you want

3213
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
the mountain because they

3214
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
can give you this and that

3215
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
you know so like ideally

3216
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:57,000
there's a little bit of

3217
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
just like you see the edge

3218
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
of a desert and you're

3219
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
like oh my god please

3220
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
yes okay so that's I was

3221
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
gonna say there's like

3222
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
idea of exploration is like

3223
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I felt there needed to be

3224
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:04,000
something in the biomes

3225
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
where like you're actually

3226
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
pushing into a biome

3227
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
because there's that one

3228
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
node that like affected

3229
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
your drop slightly but

3230
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,000
obviously that's not much

3231
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
the one that was the

3232
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
shattered lakes for example

3233
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
as you can probably

3234
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
imagine only spawns in the

3235
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
water biome and so there's

3236
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
a little bit of like you

3237
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
know and and so does

3238
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
untainted paradise and so

3239
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
does one other so there

3240
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
are actually three special

3241
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
maps that can spawn only in

3242
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
the water so go to the

3243
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
water

3244
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
and otherwise how easy is

3245
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
it to find you said there

3246
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
was an icon obviously you

3247
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:33,000
kind of have an idea of

3248
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
what biomes is it like

3249
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:35,000
also something that's

3250
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
pretty visually oh there's

3251
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
art there yeah

3252
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:37,000
spotable on the map

3253
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,000
yeah so the one we

3254
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,000
looked at with the

3255
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
megaliths which had all

3256
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
the storm and lightning

3257
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
well on the map it has a

3258
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
bunch of storm and

3259
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
lightning cool that's

3260
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
awesome cute that's

3261
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
great so we mentioned

3262
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
the atlas passive tree

3263
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
and you're seemingly I

3264
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
think you're getting

3265
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
better progression of

3266
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
that but definitely an

3267
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
issue I had with it

3268
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:58,000
personally was that it

3269
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
felt very top heavy

3270
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
both for the core one

3271
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
and also for especially

3272
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:03,000
for the league

3273
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
mechanics where like

3274
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
the league mechanics you

3275
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
don't get points until

3276
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,000
you kill the bosses which

3277
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
to me feels like the end

3278
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
of it for most players

3279
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
that kind of was the

3280
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
original pitch of that

3281
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
and I wouldn't say that's

3282
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
really changing here but

3283
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
there is more we want to

3284
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
do with that and I think

3285
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
that it could be made

3286
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
better but zero to I

3287
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
wasn't getting a change

3288
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
there to that side but

3289
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
in terms of the actual

3290
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
core atlas it definitely

3291
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
is you know like you're

3292
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
getting that earlier you're

3293
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
there's more it's a

3294
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
bigger tree there's more

3295
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
interesting stuff

3296
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
there's subtle changes to

3297
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
getting them in the sense

3298
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,000
that like for example

3299
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
the difficulty zero

3300
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
pinnacle bosses are way

3301
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
lower that's actually good

3302
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
that's actually a very

3303
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
good point so yes

3304
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
difficulty zero is now

3305
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
like half the life that

3306
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
it had before and so

3307
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:40,000
that's like a pretty

3308
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
substantial change

3309
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:41,000
difficulty four is

3310
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
currently the same as

3311
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
what it was before so

3312
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
it's same top end but

3313
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
like easy and more

3314
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:47,000
accessible for more

3315
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
people at the bottom

3316
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
end and then also

3317
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:50,000
because of like you

3318
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
know due to the

3319
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
reliquary key working

3320
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
the way it does all

3321
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
pinnacle bosses can drop

3322
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
all uniques at all

3323
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
difficulties except they

3324
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
are like substantially

3325
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
less common at

3326
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
difficulty zero but you

3327
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
feel way less bad for

3328
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
running them at that

3329
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
point now right so

3330
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
again it's just opening

3331
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
that up to a lot more

3332
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
people to farm and it's

3333
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
not so much dependent on

3334
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:09,000
if your build can't do

3335
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
difficulty four you're not

3336
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
really a viable character

3337
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
kind of mindset so much

3338
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
more easy onboarding for

3339
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
those which will give you

3340
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
your first set of points

3341
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
certainly a lot easier now

3342
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
that being said not if

3343
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
you're playing the most

3344
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
broken build of all time

3345
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
because you probably

3346
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:23,000
nerfed into the ground

3347
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
let's be real so with

3348
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
your new build we'll have

3349
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
to see how that balance

3350
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
goes with the new broken

3351
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
build yeah for sure

3352
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
one of those specters

3353
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:31,000
one of those specters

3354
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
yeah yeah anyway um

3355
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
the ultimate point being

3356
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
yeah you're you're

3357
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
you're certainly going to

3358
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
get those initial set of

3359
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
points easier than before

3360
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,000
um however yeah you are

3361
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,000
right there something

3362
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
isn't quite right there

3363
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
still and i do need to

3364
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
kind of explore we are

3365
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
going to do more with

3366
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
this like later we've

3367
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,000
we've talked about this

3368
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
issue but we didn't have

3369
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
time to do anything about

3370
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
it in 020 as much but

3371
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
um certainly by the end

3372
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
of early access um i

3373
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
think that that system

3374
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
will probably look quite

3375
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:57,000
different part of it

3376
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
also as we're talking

3377
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
about before adding all

3378
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
that those extra bits of

3379
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
content to the leagues

3380
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
it'll help give more

3381
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
interest to the to the

3382
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
trees and more nodes we

3383
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
can add to actually invest

3384
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
into because i if you

3385
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
think about a breach

3386
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
there's only so much you

3387
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
can actually modify right

3388
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
now right there's there's

3389
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
a level of radius speed

3390
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
density of monsters and

3391
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,000
like sure there's the

3392
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
standard stuff with

3393
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
monsters but like you

3394
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
can only go so far when

3395
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
you don't have all of

3396
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,000
that depth of different

3397
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
factions and different

3398
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
bosses and different

3399
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
mini bosses and

3400
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
different you know

3401
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
itemization or

3402
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
additional things with

3403
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
you know catalysts and

3404
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
whatnot like you are

3405
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
quite limited in how

3406
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
expansive a tree can can

3407
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
be and so it'd be nice

3408
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
to get those things in

3409
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
and also kind of look at

3410
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:35,000
the trees at the same

3411
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
time and reevaluate how

3412
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
that works just so we can

3413
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:38,000
have them be more

3414
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
interesting while we're at

3415
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
it right um but yeah

3416
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
and now with the pinnacle

3417
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
bosses if you're like

3418
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
halfway through a level

3419
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
you don't need to oh

3420
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
maybe i'll do that when i

3421
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
get the rest of the level

3422
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
now yes that was a that

3423
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
was a good change um so

3424
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
yeah uh as as he was

3425
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
saying the um as you

3426
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
were saying the the you

3427
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
no longer gain experience

3428
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
or lose experience anymore

3429
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
from um from pinnacle so

3430
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
you could just feel free

3431
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
to do them anytime um so

3432
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
yeah i think that's just

3433
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
a straight up upgrade and

3434
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
um i think that you know

3435
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
it's not like you were

3436
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
playing pinnacle bosses

3437
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
for experience so uh

3438
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
yeah it does the downside

3439
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
is no it's not an issue

3440
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
really um yeah it also is

3441
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
a nice thing of really

3442
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
just keeping like if we

3443
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
add more leagues for

3444
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
example and we end up

3445
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
with a domain of timeless

3446
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
conflict problem where it's

3447
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
just like rotations to

3448
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
level to max level like

3449
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
ultra yes we don't want

3450
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
that type of like at

3451
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
least now we can say

3452
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
like maps are the way

3453
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
you level like that is

3454
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
what you're doing and

3455
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
sure you might get some

3456
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
sort of unique map

3457
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
rotation here and you

3458
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
know maybe maybe not i

3459
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
don't know depends um

3460
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
but hopefully we can

3461
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
avoid that but either

3462
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
way like it's just

3463
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
really you're playing in

3464
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
maps to level and that's

3465
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:38,000
what you're doing and

3466
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
there's something nice

3467
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
about that at least

3468
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
until we've added delve

3469
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
well sure i mean there's

3470
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
going there will be future

3471
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
parallel in-game systems

3472
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,000
confirmed i know you want

3473
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
to do something i guess

3474
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
yes yes you're a fan

3475
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:54,000
you're a fan i mean you

3476
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
made the end game look

3477
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
like delv so yeah

3478
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
but yeah the um there

3479
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
was that's been a long

3480
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
term problem and when i

3481
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
need to we need to

3482
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
properly apply to the

3483
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
other game as well um

3484
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
that the whole like not

3485
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
can't do my content

3486
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
because i've got a level

3487
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
and i'm like even if

3488
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
you're only like 15% in

3489
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
like oh yeah it's just

3490
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
it's just not as bad it's

3491
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
just not as bad in pwee1

3492
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
because the leveling is

3493
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
faster yeah it's true

3494
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
it doesn't it hasn't it

3495
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
hasn't been on our radar

3496
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
as much um yeah so

3497
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
speaking of like map

3498
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
progression there's been

3499
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
some fundamental changes

3500
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
there you're telling me

3501
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
that uh now you can no

3502
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
longer drop maps below

3503
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
your current level of

3504
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
map it's correct so

3505
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
yes you'll you no longer

3506
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
get if you're playing you

3507
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
know a t5 map you're

3508
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
only going to get uh t5

3509
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
maps or if there's a boss

3510
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
there a t6 map but we've

3511
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
also smoothed the way the

3512
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
whole progression works so

3513
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
we've actually um the

3514
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:46,000
map drops are way less

3515
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
random now entirely um

3516
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
when you kill the last

3517
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
rare and a map um that

3518
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
has a uh you it can

3519
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
affect it at t1 that was

3520
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,000
a hundred percent chance

3521
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
to drop another map of

3522
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
the same tier um and

3523
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
then as you go up the

3524
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
tiers um you can still

3525
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
sustain that using

3526
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
waystone chance so

3527
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
effectively it's like

3528
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,000
it's de-randomized that

3529
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
a lot and then the way

3530
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
there are several ways

3531
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,000
that you can get

3532
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
upgrades so um in terms

3533
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:09,000
of like getting going up

3534
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
the tiers so one of

3535
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
them is is that um when

3536
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
you kill a um a boss

3537
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
that's a guaranteed plus

3538
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
one upgrade um then

3539
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:16,000
of course you can still

3540
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
cube them um up you

3541
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:18,000
know three to one uh

3542
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
recipe to go up a level

3543
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
um or you can run it

3544
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
corrupted and if you're

3545
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
running a corrupted map

3546
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
then um because it drops

3547
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
the same tier that's like

3548
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
a sort of guaranteed

3549
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
when i say corrupt i mean

3550
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
the one that barlob

3551
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
corrupting up plus one

3552
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
um that that lets you um

3553
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
do the uh run them the

3554
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
same level as well so

3555
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,000
you've kind of got those

3556
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
three options but it's

3557
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
much more intentional now

3558
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
it's like if you're going

3559
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
up maps it's like you're

3560
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
deciding okay this is a

3561
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
thing i am doing you

3562
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
don't just kind of have

3563
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
that like it doesn't just

3564
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
happen so um it's kind

3565
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:43,000
of supposed to make the

3566
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
jump like if you're just

3567
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
looking to sustain you can

3568
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
do that pretty much

3569
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
guaranteed and um uh

3570
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
unless you're dying more

3571
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:50,000
than the number of times

3572
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
you've got portals which

3573
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
is obviously you know the

3574
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
thing now now that you

3575
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
can go through portals

3576
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
again um the uh you know

3577
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
the sustain is going to be

3578
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
a lot easier if you are

3579
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
dying um but then it's

3580
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
like once you've achieved

3581
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
that it's like you

3582
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
effectively can sustain

3583
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
forever like the the

3584
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
cases where people just

3585
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
drop off the bottom and

3586
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
have issues should be

3587
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
like way less common

3588
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
ultimately it's way less

3589
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
random way more

3590
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
deterministic yeah yeah

3591
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
and uh ultimately you

3592
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
can as long as you are

3593
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
able to do the not die

3594
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
all the time you will

3595
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
sustain that tear forever

3596
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
right assuming you can

3597
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
roll enough um you know

3598
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
yeah that high enough

3599
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
mod count and you know i

3600
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
there is a boss here i'm

3601
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
going to go up a tear

3602
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
yeah and you go for the

3603
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
boss you kill the boss you

3604
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
go up a tear and if you

3605
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
and then you sustain that

3606
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
tear forever as long as

3607
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:34,000
you can do the difficulty

3608
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
yeah yeah and it's just

3609
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
very clean and if you're

3610
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
adding more mods um which

3611
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
you do need to be doing

3612
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
uh to continue to maintain

3613
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
100 percent um ability to

3614
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
to to to go up tears um

3615
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
then and if you're doing

3616
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
that early you're getting

3617
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:46,000
more maps than what other

3618
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
people are getting which

3619
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:47,000
means you can do the

3620
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
cubing as well like it's

3621
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
just kind of like it's

3622
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
sort of it just much more

3623
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
effectively gets the um

3624
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
the thing where you know

3625
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
good players can advance

3626
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
at the right speed um

3627
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
normal players don't fall

3628
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:56,000
off the bottom of the

3629
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
curve it kind of solves

3630
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
all those issues like

3631
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
without but also you're

3632
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,000
not going to have just

3633
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
like hordes of low-level

3634
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,000
waystones that you don't

3635
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
need um as well so you

3636
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
know like and and just

3637
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
know it does there are

3638
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
still you can get to the

3639
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
highest tiers relatively

3640
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
quickly you have to prove

3641
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
you're good enough your

3642
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
character's good enough but

3643
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
if you're you're doing it

3644
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
you get there right it's

3645
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
pretty quick and you can

3646
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,000
take it at your own

3647
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
leisure as well and that's

3648
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
completely fine so it's

3649
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
not like oh we've made it

3650
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
way longer to get to tier

3651
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
15 like none of that is

3652
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
really the case it's just

3653
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
that before you could luck

3654
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
into getting to tier 15

3655
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
quickly um with some level

3656
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
of you know biasing the

3657
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
luck of course uh or you

3658
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
could just be like what the

3659
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
heck i'm like constantly

3660
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:33,000
running out and have a

3661
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
really bad time right and

3662
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
so now it's just way way

3663
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
more like predictable and

3664
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
um honestly it probably

3665
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
has way more of an impact

3666
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
on the sustain problem

3667
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
which we didn't really

3668
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
which we talked about

3669
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
which is the respawning i

3670
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:47,000
would argue this thing has

3671
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
like way way way more

3672
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
impact on map sustain than

3673
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
the respawning does um i

3674
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
mean obviously if they're

3675
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
paired then they relate

3676
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
both because yeah if

3677
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
because the the the the

3678
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
guaranteed drop comes from

3679
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
the final rare so if you

3680
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
were just dying you would

3681
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
never get it so the

3682
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
respawning is necessary in

3683
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
order to make it so that

3684
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
that's gonna happen um for

3685
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
players who you know like

3686
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
and and and and obviously

3687
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
you know as it gets more

3688
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
difficult that's and you

3689
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
get less portals you start

3690
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
to get to the point where

3691
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
you're gonna run into

3692
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
trouble but if you're a

3693
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
good player you should be

3694
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
able to get up into the

3695
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
top and sustain very well

3696
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
yep you mentioned the

3697
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
idea of maps dropping

3698
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
magic by default yes that

3699
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
something you're still

3700
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
doing or um i believe it

3701
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
is um but actually wait

3702
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:24,000
but there wasn't a

3703
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
concern about that which i

3704
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
wanted to talk to you

3705
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
about later maybe not

3706
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
yeah well we'll talk

3707
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:29,000
about that later because

3708
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
um the concern was raised

3709
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
that i think is valid so

3710
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
uh yeah we were going to

3711
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
make it so that maps drop

3712
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
magic and above but we're

3713
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
actually there might be

3714
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
issues so we'll discuss

3715
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
that uh later on well

3716
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
non-decided yeah undecided

3717
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
yeah you thought it was

3718
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,000
decided i just got a week

3719
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
left we've got a week

3720
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:44,000
left it's fine

3721
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
still figuring uh it

3722
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:48,000
sounds like much more

3723
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
deterministic progression

3724
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
but yes that's the main

3725
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
of the power that you

3726
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
have that's the main

3727
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
it just should be am i

3728
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
strong enough to do this

3729
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
yes i can do it all right

3730
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
not am i lucky enough to

3731
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
do this and am i strong

3732
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
enough to do this great um

3733
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
one of those axes get

3734
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:06,000
out of here love it um

3735
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
so we've got rogue

3736
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
exiles populating the

3737
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
maps now how common are

3738
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:09,000
these guys especially with

3739
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
unique since you get their

3740
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
unique guarantee i love

3741
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
that um it's one in uh

3742
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
eight percent one and one

3743
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
and twelve and a half to

3744
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
start with but of course

3745
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
atlas tree be atlas tree

3746
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,000
um so you can speak into

3747
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
that and is there like a

3748
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
map modifier for that or

3749
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
something to guarantee it

3750
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
uh there are i think in

3751
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
this case there are this

3752
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:29,000
one is the exception

3753
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
whereas that you can get

3754
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
normally guaranteed of the

3755
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
other things we wanted the

3756
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
exiles to be one that you

3757
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
can't just guarantee all the

3758
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
time they don't always have

3759
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
uniques yeah um but when

3760
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,000
they do they yeah they're

3761
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
using them the air the air is

3762
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
very cool like how it works

3763
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:42,000
i mean they can have zero

3764
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
one two i mean yeah there's

3765
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
nothing stopping them from

3766
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
having uniques in every slot

3767
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
what but like it is the

3768
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
chance of that would be it

3769
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
is absurdly rare um i assume

3770
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
it's just roll per slot

3771
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
basically right yeah

3772
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
it's roll per slot so

3773
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
yeah yeah yeah but you

3774
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
might have a line of

3775
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
fraction of a fraction of

3776
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
a percent like all of them

3777
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
but still like five or

3778
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
something like that yeah

3779
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
you can have them and

3780
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
they have quite a lot like

3781
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
because they're a player the

3782
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
assumption is that their

3783
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
other gear is also

3784
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
relatively good so they do

3785
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
generally drop more bias

3786
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
towards dropping higher tier

3787
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
rares and stuff like that

3788
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
yeah they're doing that

3789
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
like full set of items

3790
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
because you've killed a

3791
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
player yep cool i like that

3792
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
i always love that little

3793
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
thing and i feel like it's

3794
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
even more important here in

3795
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
piri too so right that's

3796
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
awesome but just some of

3797
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
those will be unique maybe

3798
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
we wanted them to be less

3799
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:25,000
common than the other

3800
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
content but like way more

3801
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
exhilarating when you find

3802
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
them yeah um but of course

3803
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
again you can speak into

3804
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
them um at the cost of

3805
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
other things that's your

3806
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
choice um is there going to

3807
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:36,000
be some sort of like

3808
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
warning that they're coming

3809
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
or are you going to know

3810
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:39,000
they're in the map ahead of

3811
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
time or are you just gonna

3812
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
get ambushed by these guys

3813
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
leave some of them up you won't

3814
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
know they're in the map ahead

3815
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
of time much like anything

3816
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
random you run into but they

3817
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
talk though and they they'll

3818
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
say they'll say something

3819
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
before they they uh they

3820
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
monologue before they

3821
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
they do i don't know if i'd

3822
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
go quite the level of

3823
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:54,000
monologue when i said some

3824
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
insult you i'm not joking

3825
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
like some do literally insult

3826
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
you and um i believe one of

3827
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
them is one of them is one of

3828
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
the monks is a pacifist and

3829
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,000
he's like i don't want to do

3830
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
this don't force my hand he'll

3831
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
do it anyway i'm not i'm just

3832
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
you're just like running

3833
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
away exactly don't make me

3834
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
do this don't force my hand

3835
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
you can just run away um you

3836
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
know i i really like the um

3837
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
here's a occasional spike in

3838
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
difficulty and again it's

3839
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
important that they are

3840
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
relatively rare for that

3841
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
reason as well um but i do

3842
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
want it to be when you find

3843
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
one you are very excited to

3844
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
kill it and of course even

3845
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
though they portal out you

3846
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
still have your number of

3847
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
portals you have so unless

3848
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
you're running like a full six

3849
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
modded waystone just get back

3850
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
in there and and he's gone

3851
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
but or you're not

3852
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,000
whatever you've lost your

3853
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
uniques or non-uniques

3854
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
whatever they had but either

3855
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
way just move on you know

3856
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
i mean you guys were somewhat

3857
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
forgiving with this you

3858
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
didn't make it so that they

3859
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
take your items

3860
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
yes that would have been

3861
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
good that's a that's an

3862
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
event don't give me that

3863
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,000
idea that's maybe a one week

3864
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
event or something in the

3865
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:55,000
future

3866
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
just take one of your items

3867
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
and then you got a nameless

3868
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
system where you can find

3869
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
them and try and get it back

3870
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
in the future

3871
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
and you had the tame rogue

3872
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
exile gym

3873
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
i don't tames the room

3874
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
higher higher

3875
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:11,000
higher

3876
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
higher exile

3877
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
you run up and you can

3878
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
quickly be like take a million

3879
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
gold

3880
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
just give him a little snack

3881
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
like yeah you want to follow me

3882
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
i mean to be fair that would be

3883
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:21,000
a fun system

3884
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
it actually would that's

3885
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
actually not a bad idea

3886
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
running up and just being like

3887
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
hey i'm here give me a hundred

3888
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
thousand gold and i'll be your

3889
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:26,000
ally

3890
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
i know you've tinkered with the

3891
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
idea of a hireling system at

3892
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
points in the past so

3893
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,000
and now you've got your

3894
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
mercenary hireling system right

3895
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:34,000
right

3896
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
you recruit the one with good

3897
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:36,000
uniques

3898
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
we'll see

3899
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
we'll see

3900
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000
go on now a little bit of a

3901
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
rabbit hole here

3902
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
so we did have some league

3903
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
mechanics come over from path of

3904
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:44,000
exile one

3905
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
two

3906
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
path of exile two

3907
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,000
uh you're going to be looking

3908
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
to port more over are you

3909
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
going to be doing some unique

3910
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
ones that we haven't seen

3911
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:50,000
before

3912
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
i mean we're definitely going to

3913
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
be doing more unique ones

3914
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
that are you know that are just

3915
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
completely different outside of what

3916
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
we've done in pere we won uh

3917
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
absolutely

3918
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
um but i mean we like the i

3919
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
think that like

3920
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
sort of the hope in the long

3921
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
term is that each

3922
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
like you know as we kind of get

3923
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
you know past the end of early

3924
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
access and as we're sort of you

3925
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
know just going out that each um

3926
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
time we do something we're both

3927
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
adding a completely new league

3928
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
mechanic but also potentially

3929
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
bring something back

3930
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
as well kind of like as another

3931
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
additional kind of like here's

3932
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
another fun thing

3933
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
so um that's probably sort of

3934
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
what i imagine will happen but um

3935
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
it kind of really is case by

3936
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
case like some things we don't

3937
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
want to bring back some things we

3938
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,000
do you know like in our in my

3939
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
opinion can change on a dime as

3940
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
well like if someone suggests

3941
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
like a new way to interpret

3942
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
something then i might be like

3943
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
oh you know actually that is

3944
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:30,000
great

3945
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
so um you know it honestly it

3946
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,000
people assume that we have a

3947
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,000
full plan of little everything

3948
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
but it's like in reality it's like

3949
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
it's very much responsive to like

3950
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
what's happening and like you know

3951
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
the the plan the plan we the the

3952
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
actual plan relates to the things

3953
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:47,000
that like it definitely happened

3954
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
right you know you're talking acts

3955
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,000
you're talking classes you're

3956
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
talking like all that stuff is

3957
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
like definitely you know like

3958
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
that's happening it takes a long

3959
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
time produced it sort of happens

3960
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:54,000
in the background you've got

3961
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
outsources armies of people kind

3962
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,000
of working on that stuff and then

3963
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
all the kind of like more

3964
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
incidentally stuff is very much

3965
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
like oh you know let's do

3966
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,000
something cool let's just make

3967
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
this why we do this you know and

3968
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
we don't have a you know i don't

3969
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
have a plan for the next you know

3970
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
12 strong boxes it's just you know

3971
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
come up with an idea and like you

3972
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
know that's cool um you know just a

3973
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,000
fun little project for a designer to

3974
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,000
to work on how do you feel like

3975
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
some of the ones that were i felt

3976
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
somewhat definitively part of

3977
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
exile one in terms of clear speed

3978
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
like breach for example have settled

3979
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
in the peewee too do you feel like

3980
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
they're in a good spot or were they

3981
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
a good idea to bring over to the

3982
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
game um look i think breach is i

3983
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
mean breach breach is fun right i

3984
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:29,000
wouldn't i certainly wouldn't want

3985
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
to remove it um i don't know about

3986
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
like i mean there's probably been

3987
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
some balance changes i mean it was

3988
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
squarming too many it has let's just

3989
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
say that without a doubt it's much

3990
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
better now to two standards yeah and

3991
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
um it's too like currently on pewee

3992
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
too it's just too out of control

3993
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
this needs to chill there was a little

3994
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
bit of an assumption made where it

3995
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
was just like well you'll get

3996
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
overwhelmed by monsters and it's

3997
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
more a matter of survive as long as

3998
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
you can and then of course because

3999
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
you get self-propagating herald

4000
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
builds that literally can kill

4001
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:58,000
anything which by the way heralds

4002
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
don't self-propagate anymore just

4003
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
just just get that out of the way

4004
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
right now the power of the characters

4005
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
kind of yeah yeah distorted the league

4006
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
balance in a way where it's like we

4007
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
have to you know make some changes so

4008
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
yes yeah like it's coming down a bit

4009
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
i think we saw that one coming yeah

4010
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
well 100 i mean look there's a lot

4011
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,000
of things people will say they saw

4012
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
coming but um it certainly does end

4013
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
up being the case that like the

4014
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
patch notes are uh you know when we so

4015
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
by the way we're not we aren't

4016
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
releasing them at the end of this

4017
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
live stream we're going to be

4018
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
releasing them next week um but they

4019
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
are going to feel like a bit of a

4020
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
nerf fest for sure because um like

4021
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
there's a lot of things that needed

4022
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
to get you know let's let's talk

4023
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
balance yeah yeah all right all right

4024
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
my expectations and anticipations are

4025
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
that this first one is going to be an

4026
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
absolute wrecking ball of chaos and

4027
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,000
carnage and see where things land yeah

4028
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
but then maybe over time it'll become

4029
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
a sledgehammer and then like a fine

4030
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:45,000
carpenter hammer sure that that

4031
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
definitely should be the case as i

4032
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
said earlier it's like 10 000 things

4033
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
will change this time 5 000 things

4034
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
will change next time then hopefully

4035
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
we can have it every single time

4036
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
people people should really be going

4037
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
in with the expectation that like

4038
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
nothing they knew about how the game

4039
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
was balanced before is the same just

4040
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
forget everything yes forget

4041
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
everything you know

4042
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,000
exactly so uh yeah basically we'll uh

4043
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
that that kind of just means that

4044
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
like you know everyone who's finding

4045
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
builds like do it again like you're

4046
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
you're going to find more shit that

4047
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
is like outrageously broken again but

4048
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
it is not going to be the same shit

4049
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
that was broken before um so uh yeah

4050
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
attribute stacking get out of here

4051
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
yeah yeah exactly

4052
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:28,000
so i mean it's it's it's the the hope

4053
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
is though that yes you're right it'll

4054
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
stabilize to the point like like i i it

4055
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
will take time but we will get to the

4056
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
point where we no longer have things

4057
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
that are easy to become outrageous with

4058
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
right like the idea is like it shouldn't

4059
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,000
be that you can just slap a few

4060
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
different a combination of supports

4061
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
together and then like you're just

4062
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,000
like destroying pinnacles in 14

4063
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
seconds you know like it should be

4064
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:51,000
that it's a long time yeah okay sure

4065
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
uh but you mean 40 that sounds like

4066
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
terrible yeah exactly not even on

4067
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
pwe yeah that's that one seconds

4068
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
with no items right but uh anyway so

4069
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
the point is the point is is that like

4070
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
the first time you fight a pinnacle

4071
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
it should be a bit of a fight but then

4072
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
of course you do get back to the

4073
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
ability after you know like with like

4074
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
kind of like continuing to expand

4075
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
like continue to develop your character

4076
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
post pinnacle to the point of being

4077
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
able to annihilate them in seconds yeah um

4078
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
but it's just like that has to be

4079
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
earned it can't just be that like

4080
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
just a combination of supports that

4081
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
you can get trivially will do that or

4082
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
you're like a common unique you know

4083
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
and then that's yeah exactly right so

4084
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
but it can be but once you put if you

4085
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
get temporalis you know it's like well

4086
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,000
now you know like now you've got some

4087
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
you've got some shit going on but it's

4088
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
it really has to be that you know

4089
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
there's there's there is an economic

4090
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
factor involved in becoming ridiculous

4091
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
yes um and so it's when that's not

4092
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
the case that we have a problem that um

4093
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
we need to hit shit with a big giant

4094
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
balance sledgehammer yeah so originally

4095
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
i was gonna come in and like ask about

4096
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
all the specific things but we just

4097
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
assume that like it's not gonna be

4098
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
chaos so i like the idea instead of

4099
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
focusing on kind of like your core what

4100
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
are you what are you aiming for what

4101
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
are your goals what are your like what

4102
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
are your metrics

4103
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:56,000
a number of like damage slash how fast

4104
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
you kill a pinnacle boss yeah that's

4105
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
your that you're aiming for and then how

4106
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
much players can exceed that and you're

4107
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
like

4108
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,000
yeah so it really should be that you're

4109
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,000
not killing as i said not killing

4110
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
pinnacle bosses that fast um at the

4111
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
moment like a good sort of benchmark for

4112
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
like just a guy walks in and uh like

4113
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
has kind of got something that's like

4114
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
not stupid but also like not like doing

4115
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
something you know like not not crazy and

4116
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
we kind of imagine they should have about

4117
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,000
50k um dps um doing something like that

4118
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
but at the same time anything up to 500k

4119
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:32,000
dps is 10 times you know is is also

4120
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
okay and well that that'll take you from

4121
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
taking a three minute fight down to like a

4122
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
20 second fight like you know that's your

4123
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
range of like potentially acceptable yeah

4124
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
kind of things going on but if you're

4125
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
doing above uh that then you're in like

4126
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
we're probably going to nerf you territory

4127
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
at some point so um that's kind of like

4128
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
think now it's worth mentioning that like

4129
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
we've lowered like the life of pinnacle

4130
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
bosses to get that to be right and sort

4131
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
of things like the difference between a

4132
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
t15 boss and a pinnacle boss was just

4133
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,000
way too much um so uh that has been um

4134
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
that that's been sorted out um like it's

4135
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
things like that that we just need to get

4136
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
things in the right place here um so

4137
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
that's our sort of expectation um now

4138
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
obviously people are going to still find

4139
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
ways to get 10 million dps somehow i'm

4140
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
sure even though we're like nerfing many

4141
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,000
things um but um the thing i think that

4142
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
when we're talking about nerfs and how we

4143
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
want to do my key thing that i want to

4144
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
try and achieve always is that whenever

4145
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
we're nerfing something we're only nerfing

4146
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:24,000
the thing that was particularly um like

4147
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
like we're nerfing as little as possible

4148
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
to make it so that the average joe who

4149
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
works in and just tries to do stuff is

4150
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
not getting affected by it yeah it should

4151
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
only be the like ridiculously broken synergy

4152
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
thing that kind of like has some way of

4153
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
dealing with it that's um uh that's

4154
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
that's like that's actually affected by

4155
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,000
this and um i'm struggling to think of an

4156
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
example of tom ahead maybe you've got

4157
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,000
some of like you know a way that a

4158
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
targeted nerf that kind of i mean like

4159
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
say uh lightning conduit you're not going

4160
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,000
to reduce the base damage of it because

4161
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
someone's able to hit for 150 million

4162
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
with one hit from it like that comes

4163
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
from the compounding like top end levels

4164
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,000
of exposure stacking conductivity and more

4165
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
so shock effect right so it's more about

4166
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
like take away from the shock effect scaling

4167
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
side of things there and increase the base

4168
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
damage even you know like do changes like

4169
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
that where it's like for an average person

4170
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
it's now better and for someone who is

4171
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
absolutely i'm abusing is not the right

4172
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
word because like they're doing the right

4173
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:20,000
thing technically by their standards um that

4174
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
are using all those extreme factors you

4175
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
know bring those down a little bit keep

4176
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
those regulated and like it'll increase the

4177
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
average user's experience while not while

4178
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
narrowing you know bringing this down and

4179
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
bringing this ideally up a little bit in a

4180
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
lot of cases i like the idea that i thought

4181
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,000
some are reassuring to hear that there was

4182
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
actually kind of like a math here like

4183
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000
ultimately you're saying bosses have x amount

4184
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
of hit points it has 500k hit points and so

4185
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,000
we expect players around 50 yes right so

4186
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
that's a that's a clear number like we know

4187
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
that oh yeah and we're okay with you killing

4188
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
that like 10 times faster than we expect

4189
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
right but it's when you get it down to one

4190
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
second exactly 10 times is fine right and the

4191
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
problem with the more dps you have it is now i

4192
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
have to dodge less yeah i get more crowd

4193
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
control as a snowball you know it is it really

4194
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
is so you're always gonna be incentivized to do

4195
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:13,000
that and um yeah it you get to this weird thing

4196
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,000
where now it's just like okay well i think you

4197
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
after a while i was like i haven't actually seen a

4198
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
pinnacle boss fight that lasted more than two

4199
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
seconds that was really sad to me probably the

4200
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
saddest thing about the early access launch to

4201
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,000
me was seeing the first pinnacle boss fight and it

4202
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
just like and it's like oh you know like it's

4203
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
like nobody you literally nobody had to care

4204
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
about the mechanics the first time i gave it so

4205
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
many skills exactly right like there's so many

4206
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,000
skills and all these things and it's like none of

4207
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
it mattered but so that's sad yeah um so yeah we

4208
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
ideally was in a situation now i am i hope that

4209
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
doesn't happen again but honestly it's probably

4210
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:47,000
wishful thinking uh yeah yeah 10 000 things

4211
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
before there's still gonna be yeah there's still

4212
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
gonna be more and it will happen every time and

4213
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
people will find stuff and but we'll but

4214
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
look this again by the end of early access i

4215
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
want to say we're going to be in a real fucking good

4216
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
spot with this in a way that is not going to have

4217
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
so much abusive stuff and getting rid of that

4218
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:04,000
whole i feel like i have to play x it is it is

4219
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
that very demoralizing to players when they played

4220
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
their thing and all of a sudden something comes

4221
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
out and they're like oh and so the way the way you

4222
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
will know that we're successful is because you get

4223
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,000
more diversity in class in classes because it

4224
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
means that there's no longer the thing that

4225
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,000
everyone has to play because it's easy to i mean you

4226
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
definitely saw that where it's like the comments

4227
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
of any build guide it's like oh another archmage

4228
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
build or exactly it's just heralds exactly it's

4229
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
like this isn't even a build this is just herald

4230
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
again you go look at like what are all crossbow

4231
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
people playing and crossbows is actually the least

4232
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
used weapon type and so you specifically start

4233
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
there and you're like okay well here's a bunch

4234
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
of people using these skills hand of wisdom and

4235
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:41,000
action hand of wisdom and action hand of

4236
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
okay well never mind the crossbows are relevant

4237
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
right yeah even without stat stacking still

4238
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
better yeah and it's like okay well you know

4239
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
obviously take some away from there and then

4240
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
it's like okay well what are you left with well

4241
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
you're still left with probably crossbows are bad

4242
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
so what do you have to do and it's like you know

4243
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
crossbows now for example just a quick change is

4244
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
like instead of using one-handed um one-handed

4245
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,000
damage mods for added damage they use two-handed and

4246
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:07,000
their base damage and then um all the skills now

4247
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,000
have a higher growth per level because they scale

4248
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
with other external factors like attack speed less

4249
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
because they have the reload time so yeah they

4250
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
will be getting more damage per level whereas before

4251
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
most skills were very consistently growing per

4252
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:23,000
level so almost every spell would get the same

4253
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
amount of damage per level regardless of everything

4254
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
else it had and this is how you got things like

4255
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
spark just being the dominant skill you know out

4256
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
of control because it scales not only that it

4257
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
scales obviously the number of projectiles

4258
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,000
kind of out of control and with projectile and

4259
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
duration and other multiplicative scaling factors

4260
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
you end up with just like well of course i'm just

4261
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
going to spark everywhere and so now it's like

4262
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
well spark has these other multiplicative things so

4263
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
it should get less damage per level and this

4264
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,000
wasn't probably one and was the right answer and

4265
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
we somehow didn't replicate that exact thing that

4266
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
we did yeah everything is at the same damage

4267
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
growth yes we end up with exactly the same so

4268
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
now every single skill we're being looking we're

4269
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
looking at it and going you can you're going to

4270
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
scale more you're going to scale less you're going

4271
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
to scale more on the damage axis because they have

4272
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
other things that scale and this just means that

4273
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
like when you're asking well what skills have

4274
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
changed the answer is literally all of them

4275
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
no skill will have no skill will have the same

4276
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:16,000
damage as before it's like a complete you know a

4277
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
complete rebalance of the whole thing expectation

4278
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
wise it means that any skill that didn't have a lot

4279
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
of things you could do for it we'll just get we'll get

4280
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
more damage uh yeah that should be the case but i mean

4281
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
even as well like when we're looking at things like i

4282
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
sort of mentioned it vaguely before but like i'm

4283
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
trying to make sure like we are trying to make sure

4284
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:34,000
that like the combos that work early games still work

4285
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
late game um which is kind of another important

4286
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
element of that too yeah yeah so crossbow has been

4287
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
buffed a lot and i also had the other thing that was

4288
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
definitely getting a lot of buffs as warrior as well

4289
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
i mean we'll we'll see how that looks i mean

4290
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,000
everything and everything up and everything down

4291
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,000
it's so hard to even like yeah yeah it's it's so hard to

4292
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
have like a cohesive message with a single like this

4293
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
class is better yeah yeah because it's just i mean it's

4294
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
easy for mercenary skills or for crossbow skills because

4295
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
i can look at those numbers and just be like okay

4296
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
everything's clearly higher yeah but then in others it's

4297
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
like it's so it's it's too easy to say it's like warrior

4298
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
was like in many cases there was a lot of things that

4299
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,000
it was actually not bad like it was good in many ways but

4300
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
then it didn't it didn't have anything that was outrageously

4301
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
broken like how the other classes did yeah and it didn't

4302
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
gel with all players in many ways as well we've also

4303
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
done balance changes on literally every snse class as

4304
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,000
well yeah um you know pathfinder has like two extra

4305
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
notables and some changes you've got a new notable on

4306
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
chronomancer you've got um a change like you know

4307
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,000
chrono was way too much too much utility stuff like

4308
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
where's just my like good thing you know so like you got like a good

4309
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,000
there's my bonk node yeah yeah less less niche more something and then

4310
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
we've just done that on every single class we've upped

4311
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,000
upped a lot of the undertaken or bad things and we've downed a lot of

4312
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
the really good powerful things that were over the top so

4313
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
this is why we've gone back to the more conventional patch note cycle of

4314
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
a couple days beforehand maybe yeah i mean look

4315
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
absolutely if they were ready you would have them

4316
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:03,000
they're not ready because we're not finished right like and giving someone half the

4317
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:06,000
balance changes doesn't make allow them to even make educated decisions on

4318
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
what does it help you so it's completely pointless at that point

4319
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
so we'd rather give you everything all at once instead of just some like here's

4320
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,000
you know but even if even once you have the patch notes like don't even be

4321
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
under the mistaken illusion that you'll be somehow able to determine what the

4322
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:23,000
best builds are from that like uh this it's because it's such a big

4323
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
difference it's hard to take things into context because you can look at it and

4324
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,000
say oh okay so like this thing got buffed but this thing got nerfed it's like

4325
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,000
okay but you're linking just two things you're not linking all of the other

4326
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:36,000
things yeah exactly so you know yeah we'll try though we'll try sure

4327
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,000
give it a shot do your best look when the game released you uh had to learn

4328
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
everything you just might have to do it again

4329
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:47,000
and again every single patch after every major patch after this you know you're

4330
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
going to have to have less and less of that and your familiarity will be able to

4331
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,000
come in and be useful um so at least from a balanced perspective at this point

4332
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,000
like you know it's not like we've structurally changed the campaign and all that so you

4333
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:01,000
have still a lot of information and knowledge that is going to help you play the game

4334
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
better anyway from the on your you know second i mean a lot of people made maybe

4335
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
made multiple characters but for a lot of people this might just be their second

4336
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,000
character yeah so they're certainly going to be more equipped and we've had the

4337
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,000
races so you've been able to see how the best people oh yeah oh yeah

4338
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
there's some definitely some good tips to learn from there oh yeah

4339
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:22,000
that lever skip with the portal beautiful my favorite

4340
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:29,000
um on the slightly bigger picture as well like life and armor versus energy shields are you happy

4341
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,000
with kind of where either of those are at or what do you what do you kind of hope to achieve

4342
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:39,000
with them energy shields certainly i mean primarily due to grim feast um and like mana

4343
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,000
stacking being a little bit out of control have been that's been too strong and more the inside

4344
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:51,000
of defense for sure um expect some pretty drastic changes there um as for armor well you know it's one of

4345
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:57,000
those like accuracy kind of things right where it's like dexterity and like you know where it's

4346
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:03,000
like honestly our next point with that is honestly just to get in a room and just be like all right

4347
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:10,000
let's pretend it didn't exist and we were coming up with the game from scratch and uh you know we're

4348
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:15,000
like okay we have strength what would we want the ideal defense to be and honestly might even extend

4349
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:19,000
further than that and really just see firstly to make sure we end up if we don't end up at the same

4350
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:24,000
point make sure we end up as better maybe we do end up at the same point and we do just go okay here

4351
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,000
are some other changes that we need to make around physical damage in particular and something like

4352
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:33,000
that but it's one of those things where at this point we just need to like review it from literally

4353
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:38,000
back to basics and see where we end up because it might be something completely different but like

4354
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:44,000
it might also end up being relatively the same and maybe it was the better answer but either way it's

4355
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:49,000
worth the discussion with the time because you know it's i wouldn't say we're happy with it and

4356
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:54,000
i wouldn't say we're necessarily like all the way unhappy with it but it's yeah there's something not

4357
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:58,000
not quite right going on for sure you're still fundamentally questioning some of these things and

4358
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:04,000
willing to go back to the drawing board on them which is quite interesting well 100 we drastically

4359
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:10,000
changed how evasion works and i would say it's for the better you know and we should be exploring that

4360
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:17,000
with everything and um you know so we just need to do that process still um you know that being said

4361
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:23,000
you know as we make things more like the shield block better as we um buff the ascendancies or

4362
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:30,000
nerf them and and you know on the other defensive arcs um you know things like armor will become better

4363
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:35,000
but yeah again it's not quite right but i don't have enough information to say you know where it will

4364
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:41,000
look what it will look like in the future so yeah okay cool um so let's talk about recovery as well

4365
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:45,000
because that's another big thing i remember early on exile con discussions about the importance of

4366
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:49,000
limited recovery in making combat matter you know so that you could have situations where you're

4367
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:54,000
attritioned or where like the hit that you took matters for the next hit that you take and you know

4368
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
just back up the full but um it's pretty good in boss fights honestly i feel like recovery is

4369
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:04,000
somewhat limited that still happens a bit but uh certainly in clearing you have access to tons of

4370
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
recovery with yeah cannibalism and things like that it's certainly out of control and it's a

4371
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:14,000
little bit of again partly due to the fact that um kill speed and clear speed just was way higher

4372
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:19,000
than we had expected and what we balanced around and um because if we were balancing around what

4373
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:25,000
people are currently doing with the the upper echelons of builds you'd like you know you'd have to

4374
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
have effectively every average player and average build just could be completely it would be

4375
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:34,000
useless for them um now there are ways around that of course but um part of it is like a lot of the

4376
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,000
recovery mechanics like if you're talking about things like on kill and based on damage doubt

4377
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:44,000
it's it is a rich get richer problem and um so yes there are cases that are problematic and then

4378
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:49,000
there are just characters that are too strong and there's a little bit of both going on i wouldn't

4379
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:55,000
say we've targeted any recovery specifically here really it's not been a main goal i'm not going to

4380
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:00,000
say that there aren't little bits changed here and there but it's more about you know we've really

4381
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:05,000
made sure to just it's kind of hard to say exactly what we've done because again this is probably

4382
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:09,000
everything we're going to have to look at next time because there are so many changes that it is hard

4383
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
to even like understand how this is going to fit into once the dust clears you might be able to see

4384
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:18,000
100 like we're at the point where we do need a little bit of like all right we need another round

4385
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:24,000
of testing for this because yeah you know and again i'm going to stress it is actually impossible

4386
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:29,000
for the amount of changes for us internally to be able to be certain or test all of this yeah but the

4387
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:36,000
the vision is is still that idea of like more stricter recovery or less powerful recovery than

4388
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:41,000
what well it shouldn't certainly be like here's one little one little piece and now it's fully

4389
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:45,000
solved right like yeah having heaps of recovery should be something you can achieve but it should

4390
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:51,000
require a decent amount of investment or high tier item okay itemization right like for sure it should

4391
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:56,000
be possible it just shouldn't be trivial yeah so and on that note then for like vision what's your

4392
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:59,000
vision of what path of exile 2 is supposed to be because i think some people are still like unsure

4393
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:06,000
about is it supposed to be just kind of more like path of exile 1 a faster game or is it supposed to

4394
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:11,000
be a slower game a much more different thing like this is a hard thing to communicate but it still it

4395
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:15,000
gets asked a lot and i feel like people are still a bit unsure it's funny though because like once

4396
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:19,000
again it's not i don't view it as just a pure speed question it's about like is the combat engaging

4397
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:24,000
and fun yeah and also are you getting to the point where you never get to engage with bosses

4398
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:30,000
like if you're never if if if the first time you fight a boss you just destroy it without seeing

4399
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:34,000
any of its mechanics then that's a problem and it doesn't really say anything about the pace of

4400
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,000
combat like if you look at some of the um the hunter stuff we've got there like it's incredibly fast

4401
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:41,000
paced when it comes to like dashing around and stuff but you still have to engage with things and

4402
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:46,000
that's the key element for us so um you know like obviously players want to get ridiculously powerful and we

4403
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,000
still want to let them get ridiculously powerful just has to be earned it has to be you know like

4404
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:55,000
after a certain point and like after you like once you have finished your character once you've sort

4405
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:00,000
of done everything then yeah you should be just like you know like like crazy and like beyond the

4406
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
point of any of all reason it's just that you have to earn it you have to get there right and like

4407
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
that's the power growth thing that's like it's really hard to sort of just like smoothen that out

4408
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:11,000
across the whole game but like that's ultimately the goal right you have to kind of get to the point of

4409
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,000
like that you constantly feel you're getting stronger you always feel like the next like oh i got this and now

4410
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:18,000
i'm better and now i'm better and now i'm better and keep on going and you have to scale that all

4411
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,000
the way to the end because the moment that you get to the point where you're just trivializing

4412
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:25,000
everything too early it's like well the rest of the game just becomes boring after that point right

4413
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:29,000
it has to be that you know there's the level of that that you still still have to get and so kind

4414
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:33,000
of based on that just earlier discussions about like damage and boss time to kill and things like

4415
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:38,000
that it sounds like the time where you want that to be starting to taper off like the players can start

4416
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:45,000
to cheat that a bit is after they've done pinnacle bosses well you should feel that way multiple times

4417
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:49,000
throughout the game but then later you still then get to a new level of challenge the store

4418
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:52,000
requires to engage again like if we're doing our job correctly it's like you you reach a point of

4419
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,000
feeling like you're a god and then you're like oh shit but there's new god like shit above me that

4420
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:01,000
then makes me have to then do the exactly exactly right so you you have to keep on you have to keep

4421
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:05,000
on with that it's actually really hard to take you back from feeling like oh i'm i'm all powerful back

4422
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:10,000
down to like i'm feeling you know and so you have to kind of get that that in there as you want that

4423
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,000
dragon ball anime arc yeah for sure right there's always a new level of super saiyan after the previous one

4424
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,000
exactly right that's what you have to be able to do and so yeah it's just smoothly taking up that

4425
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
up that power level curve um you know all the way to the end yeah so i think like when it comes down

4426
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:29,000
to things like movement speed when clearing it's about like if you're able to just ignore everything

4427
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:33,000
because you're moving yeah exactly if you're able to ignore everything then um then then you obviously

4428
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:37,000
will move really fast if you're not able to ignore everything suddenly your clear speed is like not as

4429
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:40,000
big of a thing so so long as there are still things that are challenging you as long as you reach the

4430
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,000
next tear and like everything's harder again then you're good i feel like a difficult like a

4431
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,000
point of the difficulty here between the communication of this with you guys and some

4432
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,000
of the people in the community is that i feel like you're not really looking at it in terms of pwee one

4433
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,000
versus two you're just you're just trying to answer that question specifically yeah it's not really

4434
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:00,000
about like it being like pwee one or two exactly right it's just about making the combat good it's

4435
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:06,000
either the combat is fun or it isn't yeah yeah and there's a sort of spectrum of stuff there but i would

4436
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:12,000
say that you want to be able to engage with the boss you want to be able to fight its mechanics and use it do

4437
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:16,000
it's skills and you want to feel like you can overcome those over time and get better and you

4438
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,000
want to engage with monsters and you want and yeah there's probably some people who are like no i

4439
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
don't i want to just press a button and loot drops on the ground and i don't have to look or do anything

4440
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:29,000
and well so that's an interesting point is there's this uh let's let's say the quote unquote mythical

4441
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:35,000
average build um is are they able to switch their brain off and watch netflix on the second monitor

4442
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:39,000
only if they're doing like maps three levels under what they should be doing or something

4443
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:44,000
or should that be able to happen at kind of like once you're at your your tier of godhood

4444
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:50,000
yeah but i actually want to address that because like okay so i'm watching well okay right now i'm

4445
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:55,000
watching deep space nine funnily enough but but uh but uh you know i'm watching deep space nine as i'm

4446
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,000
playing as i'm testing the game right it's like you just you develop a muscle memory and that muscle

4447
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,000
memory can include using multiple skills and doing like multiple things and that's still to me more

4448
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:07,000
engaging than just holding down a button you know so you're saying this like watching things on the

4449
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:12,000
secondary thing isn't about the game being easy it's just a skill issue i'm just saying that you

4450
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:17,000
like you you you your your your muscle memory can develop for more than just using a single skill

4451
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:21,000
you just you know like and and we've always sort of said that there's this thing like okay sometimes

4452
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:26,000
sometimes you pause you pause the show right sometimes that happens because you come to a

4453
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:31,000
thing that's like uh this is an update to the classic you know second monitor i love how this freaking

4454
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,000
watching something on the second screen has become such a fundamental part of the community's just

4455
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:39,000
grabbed it and it's become a thing forever but it's up it's been updated now like this is the

4456
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:43,000
update you want you want them to have to pause sometimes it was a philosophy set for a different

4457
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:47,000
because i feel like i've said that 10 years ago about how like sometimes you get the spike in

4458
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:51,000
difficulty you know like now you have to do this to me yeah i guess that turns into pause the video

4459
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:57,000
at this point but uh yeah but no but look if i i i play this way as well right look it's not like i'm

4460
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,000
you know like once once you get to a certain point it's like you know obviously you're going to want to

4461
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:04,000
you know the music you've heard it in lots of times you know like you want to have something else going on that's

4462
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:11,000
that's fine um but uh i still think that there needs to be the ability to um have um uh you know

4463
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:16,000
to to have something engaging from time to time that you have to do deal with so yeah it's always

4464
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:19,000
been a bit of a silly a silly thing because you've got so much element of choose your own difficulty

4465
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:24,000
in part of exile right like exactly do harder maps do easy maps but um i mean but look people always

4466
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,000
want to choose the harder stuff right so therefore that's what they're judging it against that's true

4467
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:32,000
and so that's why you do need a level of economic gating to make it so that like you know you can't go too

4468
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,000
far with difficulty without um uh you know without having to prove the the economic stuff on some

4469
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,000
level so that you can yeah you're dying and losing the map exactly you're losing the map um so um yeah

4470
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:46,000
that like we have to think like all that map sustain stuff is so tricky for that reason yeah that's

4471
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:52,000
exactly right um yeah that sounds like some big advancements in that regards um so i've got some

4472
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:57,000
kind of random tale questions here um are you planning in the future on i don't think it's probably

4473
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:01,000
happening this time around but on changing campaign pacing at all like i feel like some of the zones are

4474
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:05,000
probably a bit too large and a bit too empty um i mean that's more about adding more stuff to them

4475
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:09,000
than it is about making them smaller like um there's still a lot more events and campaign that

4476
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,000
we haven't added yet that i'm still doing there's like big lists of you know things that we never

4477
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:18,000
got time to do so we'll keep on getting to those and the argument there which i i do believe in is an

4478
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,000
area should be able to be large if it has enough interesting things the frequency of interesting

4479
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:26,000
things is high i mean i mean yeah like the size of an area is completely right like imagine we had

4480
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:29,000
imagine there were no load screens you just walked from place to place like you wouldn't be thinking

4481
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:34,000
about area size exactly it's just is the density of interest enough it's true um you know like the

4482
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
the fact that there happens to be a load screen between one place and the other is not really

4483
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:43,000
the wrong is directly yeah proportional to interesting exactly right so yeah so so to me one thing we do

4484
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:49,000
need to obviously do and we have done in some areas is just making sure that if it is a large area um

4485
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:53,000
it's not just interesting things to find as well it's also making sure there's enough monster variety

4486
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:58,000
that way it's not just so repetitive yeah exactly yeah yeah where you've got like almost different

4487
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:02,000
there are some where i would say the area is uh large enough or you're in there long enough such

4488
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,000
that there isn't enough and there isn't enough monster variants and so it gets a bit repetitive

4489
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,000
yeah it's completely true that anytime someone says oh this area is too large i'm like well okay

4490
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,000
so what monsters are we changing what uh what events are we adding that kind of stuff right because

4491
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
that that's the way that you change around like them there are areas that are very large that no one

4492
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:21,000
complains about because they're you know stuff they got a lot of things there's also like there are good

4493
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:26,000
i don't know how many you know people are going to play this or how many people stop playing before

4494
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:32,000
uh 0.1.1 but like you know it's worth noting again like areas have like the fast travel thing now as well

4495
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:37,000
yeah it's only between checkpoints and um you know there's there's some of that stuff which i'm hoping

4496
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:41,000
again when people start playing from scratch they get to see a lot of the improvements we did before as well

4497
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:45,000
and see how they feel about it again and it's worth mentioning through campaign we've got both the

4498
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:48,000
wisps and there's also strong boxes as well through campaign like they feel a little bit different

4499
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
as you know there's just as you play through you're certainly finding some things you wouldn't

4500
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:58,000
have tried soon yeah yeah the what the shrines i'll have them actually in the campaign soon yeah cool

4501
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:03,000
art wasn't quite done right or something like that yeah yeah it might be a bit weird the ones in

4502
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:07,000
end game it works a little bit better narratively but using that asset throughout the campaign it

4503
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:11,000
would feel real random so um it's just a matter of as soon as the art's done um

4504
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:17,000
chucking those in as well oh great so that could be a after it would certainly be shortly after but

4505
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:22,000
but also like every time we do uh like that we're expecting people to play through again like we'll

4506
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:26,000
probably tweak like which the content spawns are different areas and we'll just like fiddle around

4507
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:30,000
a bit so that then you play it just feels a bit fresh and you know things going on there yeah you

4508
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,000
kind of got me there i feel like each of the zones i'm trying to think of that like feel like they're

4509
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:41,000
way too big is like they're also just coincidentally empty yes so i guess that is maybe

4510
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:46,000
perhaps it's the exact same problem happens in maps by the way yeah yeah i mean yeah we talked

4511
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:50,000
about that like the exact boring empty map when when when when the maps when people say the maps

4512
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,000
too big yeah just not i think i i think i've phrased it to jonathan yesterday when we're talking about

4513
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:00,000
it as every screen looks the same as every other screen it wouldn't matter where i'm standing in

4514
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,000
the map it would look i think the map you were talking about was step like we were looking at step and

4515
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:09,000
being like okay well what's actually like it's a big square yeah yeah there's not there's nothing going on

4516
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,000
and even if there was stuff going on i mean like it's funny because like it took us a little while

4517
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
to even come to an understanding of like what needed to change there because i'm sort of saying

4518
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:22,000
like okay well um you know like uh it's very random it's like you know do you find the cold plains and

4519
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:26,000
d2 as to be a boring area because it's ultimately kind of similar um but the answer is well there's

4520
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,000
buildings sometimes and you get like you know there's just like you just there's just a little more

4521
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
going on than that way so like we need to make sure that maps feel that way too yeah yeah yeah

4522
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:40,000
um there has been a few pervasive crashes and issues oh god yes yes well i'll tell you what

4523
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:44,000
the entire engine team have basically been entirely focused on that for three months and it's been

4524
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:49,000
horrible because um so i mean it's kind of a long story and i don't know if i should go into all of

4525
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:56,000
it but ultimately um the issue is that um on nvidia cards the remaining issue at least is that on video

4526
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:01,000
cards if you're using a driver that's bigger than i think 560 point something like basically after that

4527
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:06,000
point the game crashes and if you install an older driver than that it doesn't um and um like like

4528
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:13,000
the crash happens in the in the driver in the gpu um nvidia is just like not really much help you

4529
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,000
know like and so it's like just trying to nail down what it even caused it it's just so hard when it's

4530
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
like and the thing that sucks about it is like it won't reproduce on anywhere except production and

4531
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:26,000
alpha and like a moment you change you look at it like we can't reproduce it anymore and yet for some

4532
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:31,000
people it happens all the time and it's just like it's so horrible um and like you know the the

4533
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:37,000
what we've we actually come up with a somewhat ridiculous idea um that was now implementing

4534
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:41,000
which we're going into 020 with by the way which is that um and this will seem stupid but like how

4535
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:47,000
about we just don't crash which tell me about this yeah yeah exactly so basically what we do is what

4536
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:54,000
we're now changing it to is that if the gpu driver crashes if the gpu driver crashes what we do is we

4537
02:29:54,000 --> 02:30:02,000
create a new uh a new um uh device and then upload all the textures to that um the game is paused while

4538
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:07,000
this is happening and then it unpauses and then uh the game keeps going and so that is what that is

4539
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,000
what we're doing to solve this crap and it's like it was it's kind of ridiculous that this has to be

4540
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:14,000
the solution because like we like it just it's it's just mysteriously in the nvidia driver we have

4541
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:19,000
like and we have tried to find a workaround for this it is just like so difficult um and um so that

4542
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:24,000
in zero to that's what will happen so do the while we're here like do the players have a workaround

4543
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:30,000
like well like yeah yeah you can you can install the driver earlier than what about vulcan does that

4544
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:36,000
matter uh yes uh well but no not entirely it does still happen uh in vulcan but well it's a bit

4545
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:41,000
unclear uh about that particular thing about whether or not that that that's this but i figured it

4546
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:46,000
might be no no it is it is it isn't it isn't it isn't the driver but um i mean yeah like if you if

4547
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:50,000
you install an older driver it will go away um like so all of this time when people have been

4548
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:55,000
saying the classic armchair developer meme it was like why don't you just add a bit of code that says

4549
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:00,000
if crash equals false yeah well you know something like that basically yeah basically do the engineering

4550
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:05,000
to allow us to just recreate the entire like gpu context uh and then there you go and then don't

4551
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:10,000
crash and that is actually the solution we're now doing with but um it's it's like the thing is the

4552
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:16,000
other one that sucked though was that stupid damn full system freeze because i'll tell you what if

4553
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:20,000
the entire system freezes there is just nothing you can do to find out what the hell caused it

4554
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:24,000
because like you know nothing there's no like crash report there's no logging there's no literally

4555
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:30,000
nothing right and it's like that happened um that that happened when um the the windows november

4556
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:37,000
h2 update shipped and then things just started mysteriously freezing and um my god that was hard to

4557
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:40,000
track down and you know you asked microsoft about it they're like oh we'll look into it and it's

4558
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:44,000
like nothing happens you know it's like jesus christ guys like you know like like it's it's it's it's so

4559
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:49,000
annoying i can feel your frustration is incredibly frustrating because it's like we want nothing

4560
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:54,000
better than to fix this shit um so that one was fixed like um there was some spin lock implementation

4561
02:31:54,000 --> 02:32:00,000
that like i don't have any understanding of why it causes it to happen but we tweaked it a bit and now

4562
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,000
it doesn't happen anymore and it's like there's no rational reason why this should cause the operating

4563
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:07,000
system to freeze and it's like there's not even a good answer at the end there's not even like a here's what

4564
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:12,000
was wrong it's just like this random particular sequence of operations being done causes your

4565
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:16,000
entire system to freeze for no reason after this windows update and it's like well cool you know

4566
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:20,000
like what do you what do you do about that like it's just it's just it's just terrible and um so

4567
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:26,000
yeah that one sucked um but basically now i mean it's funny because we've fixed so many crashes that

4568
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:32,000
weren't the crash so like general stability apart from that crash is incredibly good now 99 yeah like

4569
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:38,000
maybe probably yeah and it's like and it's like and it's like the thing is we'll we'll fix a crash

4570
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:41,000
and we'll be like oh maybe this is the crash and then it fixes like two percent of crashes and you're

4571
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:47,000
like well that wasn't the crash but at least it looks good to fix right like you know it's it's it's

4572
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:52,000
it's it's so annoying um yeah but as i said we have a workaround now that's good that that will

4573
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:57,000
read basically recreate the graphics device if you might get a pause and you'll get a pause for three

4574
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:01,000
seconds and then um you know like roughly depending on sounds like a and then it will continue and the

4575
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:05,000
game will pause it you know i obviously just make it clear we don't want it to remain like that

4576
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:09,000
obviously yes yes obviously we'll still try and fix it but at least it means you're not crashing um

4577
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:13,000
and you're certainly not freezing anymore that's sorted out um and then you know we found another

4578
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:17,000
one recently which was like okay so this this is another stupid one right like so anyway so there's

4579
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:23,000
the whole like intel um cpu issue like on 13th and 14th generation intel cpus where like there's

4580
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:29,000
some freaking voltage regulation problem that causes cpus to break in a certain way um and uh if that

4581
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:34,000
happens then like the thing that will break is that like um the decompressor will like like it'll

4582
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:38,000
decompress something and like one bit of it will be wrong like literally one bit in there and then

4583
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:42,000
it fails like a hash check and then that just causes the game to crash and so the fix like you

4584
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:45,000
know it's like things like that will happen as well like you've got you've got stuff like that and it's

4585
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:51,000
like well once again it's like it's like it is our problem we have to fix it because it's affecting

4586
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:57,000
real users but like the solution um to stuff like that um yeah it's just so annoying to find um and

4587
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:03,000
you know so yeah anyway it sounds like you've improved a lot of the unrelated crashes and you've

4588
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:07,000
come up with a good workaround at least hopefully yeah that sounds like a massive improvement but i

4589
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:11,000
also just think your your obvious frustration is very validating for people who have been frustrated

4590
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:15,000
with this exactly but the thing and the thing that's the most annoying about it is that like all

4591
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:19,000
these uh the engine team who are spending time fixing this and they're not able to spend time

4592
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:22,000
working on performance issues which you know is something else that we need to be obviously

4593
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:27,000
improving over time um so uh you know there's been a few performance improvements but like not nearly

4594
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:31,000
the number we would have had if we had all you know seven of those people tied up like you know

4595
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:35,000
like like working on uh performance improvements so you know that's uh that that's been the most

4596
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:39,000
frustrating thing about it crashes first yeah 100 but it's like yeah when they're when they're kind

4597
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:44,000
of we have been chipping away at some decent ones though yeah no we have we got some pretty yeah

4598
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:49,000
good performance problems resolved yeah i mean there's that ice one that was really bad yeah you know

4599
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,000
there's things like so like the worst offenders we're certainly fixing but um and like i have no doubt by the

4600
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:58,000
time we get um you know like like each time we do a new release there'll be it'll be even better yeah

4601
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:02,000
great um you know and and yeah by the time we get a full release i'm sure it'll be like very good and

4602
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:08,000
i mean speaking of i know it's like tangential sort of as well obviously with we had a lot of woes

4603
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:13,000
around the release but we've done a whole lot of back-end engineering work to make it yes you know yes

4604
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:19,000
yes so um yeah the the launch should go smoother as far as like um you know it was pretty good it

4605
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:24,000
was wow it still was five hours of yeah yeah yeah yeah but like five hours could be no no no this time

4606
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:30,000
this time i mean i'm tempting i'm tempting fate here but like we've made significant improvements to

4607
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:35,000
um the ability for the realm to handle stuff so so five minutes this time well i mean we'll see right

4608
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,000
you never know what's gonna go wrong sometimes get caught out by something random yeah yeah it should

4609
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:46,000
be much better this time yeah yeah i hope you get enough players to stress your theory yes that's

4610
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:51,000
always a good thing to aim for uh we'll just run up with a couple of the random kind of chat questions

4611
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:56,000
before we finish up today um any possibility of ascendancy respects is that something you've

4612
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:00,000
considered especially with all the changes going on um we're sort of not in love with it um like

4613
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:05,000
it's just one of those things where like i feel like it's key to the identity of the character and

4614
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:10,000
like respecting like the the journey of the character like it does get pretty significantly

4615
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:15,000
compromised if you um if you allow for that but i know mark is especially strong strongly yeah i mean

4616
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:21,000
the answer is going to be the exact same same as last time which is like i don't know exactly or i

4617
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:25,000
don't know how to articulate exactly why i feel so strongly about this and so do a lot of the team

4618
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:33,000
members of like again it's just that your choices should matter and you know it's obviously something

4619
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:37,000
that i was okay with impure we won and so there is probably a world where i will be okay but

4620
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:41,000
there's got to be some level of work involved to achieve it that isn't to just pay a little bit of

4621
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:47,000
gold and then you're done or whatever like i want to find a way to do it if we're going to do it in a

4622
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:51,000
way that is like grounded that's interesting and it's difficult to we're not i wouldn't say difficult

4623
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:56,000
but like requires some actual work to do so um that would be the compromise i'd certainly be willing

4624
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:00,000
to explore which i have been thinking about recently because i know every single time we come to a

4625
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:07,000
expansion it's going to come up so the trial of respecting or something yeah there'll be something

4626
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:11,000
where your character has to undergo some sort of challenge or something to do it and i know you

4627
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:16,000
could argue while doing the trial is that and you're not entirely wrong but something a bit a bit more

4628
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:22,000
sacrifice a few enemies i'm sure we'll have a conclusive decision or at least a level of

4629
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:27,000
articulation one way or the other by the end of early access um but uh for now yeah it's just

4630
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:32,000
going to take me a bit more time to figure out what i want to do there um is dynamic switching

4631
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:37,000
between keyboard and mouse and controller coming at all that's not in zero to oh but it will be

4632
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:41,000
coming on its way yes like and i'm really hoping by zero three oh like we should be able to get that

4633
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:47,000
that is a very key feature um it seems like it's going to be hard to juice loot uh to loot juice maps

4634
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:51,000
with only one portal on i remember this this question has already been answered well actually no

4635
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:57,000
because this is a concern we have to figure it out yeah so in the next week we will actually be

4636
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:02,000
looking into this one there's a few problems around it still there are other things to come

4637
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:08,000
up like yeah you know you also don't want it to be that if you did use your one portal you because

4638
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:13,000
it's your portal that's used not everyone's portal that's used because when it says that's actually a

4639
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:17,000
good point yeah it's a good point i think we mentioned up to six players yeah yeah and so when

4640
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:23,000
it's six portals it's six portals for up to six players which means technically it's 36 entries and exits

4641
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:29,000
out of the map right and like that changes things in a way where it's like when it's down to one it's

4642
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:34,000
like you don't want it to be that oh i failed the map quick ziggy come join my party get in here and

4643
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:40,000
finish it for me um you know you don't want to kind of have that style of um play happening so there are

4644
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:44,000
still some things we need to figure out with this because it's going to promote some uh what i would

4645
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:48,000
probably classify as degenerate behavior as well as the fact that yeah you're probably like oh my

4646
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:54,000
inventory's full zone out oh what the okay sweet and sure you can add a warning but i don't i don't

4647
02:38:54,000 --> 02:39:00,000
know if even restricting it to just one inventory of loot like that is good right i i would personally

4648
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:05,000
prefer that it's one death not one you know entry so there's there's some stuff we need to figure out

4649
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:09,000
but again jonathan and i need to talk about that and actually solve that so that's interesting yeah

4650
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:14,000
because the death seems like the important part so as long as there's not like a way to cheat it

4651
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:18,000
it seems like almost like you'd want to allow people to come and go as they please until they die

4652
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:25,000
right which is a a potential solution um yeah again can't say for sure but yeah 100 that person

4653
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:30,000
is right for bringing that up and uh it is on our radar for this coming week to have a weekend as

4654
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:37,000
well to have a solution for yeah um so with this new league not having a specific like league mechanic

4655
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:43,000
is it still a challenge league does it still have challenges um it's actually no there's no

4656
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:46,000
achievements or challenges yeah i'm pretty sure we weren't going to do that for a little bit yet

4657
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:52,000
there's not really maybe later and later in early access but for now not really yeah um we're just

4658
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:56,000
trying to keep it more about the game and the mechanics and less about you know make the game

4659
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:59,000
first the achievements and the achievements will certainly an achievement system and stuff like

4660
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:04,000
that will certainly be there with the full release and we'll reintegrate all of that at the time

4661
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:11,000
uh is there any plans for stash tab expansions um like for example rune storage oh 100 right now i'm

4662
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:16,000
actually trying to at least add the affinity without adding a custom tab those two things appeared um

4663
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:20,000
from the implementation standpoint so we might want to try and divorce them so we can have

4664
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:25,000
affinities without it oh yeah wanted to get those in this patch but unfortunately they just didn't

4665
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:30,000
quite make it so like i mean it's actually quite likely to come in sometime like like in a point

4666
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:35,000
release after like like within the zero to as soon as the patch is out and stable and we're on top of

4667
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:39,000
things it's going to be like all right we need to get all those like ux or quality of life things

4668
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:45,000
that we blatantly missed out on yeah yeah um for example the like being able to add bookmarks to

4669
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:50,000
your atlas and write that is one that is something we designed some stuff for it we just haven't got

4670
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:55,000
it yet so i want to say it's like 80 implemented right now yeah yeah so it'll be soon as we can

4671
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:01,000
we'll get that in there all right that is excellent and on that note we'll wrap things up today thank

4672
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:05,000
you so much jonathan thank you so much mark thank you very much for coming thank everyone for

4673
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:09,000
thanks for having me here great time thank you very much everyone and i'm ziggy d and thanks for

4674
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,000
watching

4675
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:11,000
see you
