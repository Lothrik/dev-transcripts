1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's hard to contain my rage.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There we go.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Are you mad?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Just get glad.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Remove that.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, yeah.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I should fix my camera.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I should fix my camera.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm so happy my voice isn't worse.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Also, thank you guys so much for all the subs and donations and stuff doing this.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Really appreciate it.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:08,000
ASMR stream?

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Man, do you think there's sickness ASMR streams?

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
100%?

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
100%.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Will sis survive through the interview?

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, it is unfortunate that I'm sick.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Obviously, we can't really postpone it.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hopefully, this is okay.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm so sorry.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I didn't plan to be sick.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I even, like, tried not to stream or talk to make sure my voice would work.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You sound good?

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, I just...

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I hate coughing.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I get so, like, annoyed.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Just don't cough on him.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
True.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm trying to cough a lot now to, like, clear a little bit.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Am I getting sick?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What a bitch move.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Beta.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Beta is fuck.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Alright, they're calling.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hello.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How are you doing?

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How's it going?

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, okay.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Just, you know.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Just got back from Korea.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, wow.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's see.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let me just do a quick audio check.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How does he sound compared to me, chat?

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Loud.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, I'll turn.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Testing.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Testing, one, two, three.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A bit loud, okay.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, I put it down to 75%.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How's that?

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Testing, one, two, three.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm Jonathan Rogers.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Low?

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Is that all right?

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Hopefully, we're okay.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Too low.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's try.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, I'm going to try.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
One sec.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay, try that.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
85.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hopefully, that's a lot better.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sounding okay.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Testing, one, two, three.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay, perfect.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Excellent.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All right.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And I just need to quickly set up our cameras, and we are good to go.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How are you doing?

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, as I said, just okay, but just, you know, got back from Korea, still a little bit

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
tired.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They, my flight got canceled.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Which is always a pain.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So, I'm a day late, and maybe a little bit tired, tired, than I would have otherwise been

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
on this call, but that's all right.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, I bet.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Damn.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, thank you so much for taking time to speak with us and answer questions.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No problem.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No problem.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You've been doing, like, a lot of, a lot of these now.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, you know, the, right at the end, it's like suddenly my job is doing marketing, basically.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, but, oh, well, that's how it is.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I, it's, it's crazy how many I've done now.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's see, almost ready.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's see.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I think we are potentially good to go.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That look okay for everybody?

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
All right.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I think, I think we're good.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, I do want to apologize real quick.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm a little bit sick, so I might be coughing a little bit, and.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's okay.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Are we coughing as well?

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll try not to cough on you.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yeah.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But yeah, awesome.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you so much for joining.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Welcome, everybody.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I am joined here today by Jonathan Rogers, director on Path of Exile 2.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you so much for, for being here.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No problem.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I mean, you know, it's always good to talk to you.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We've done a number of these interviews, and I honestly, I'm always happy just to talk to whoever's got good questions for me, honestly.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, I've tried to do just that.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, I've sent Jonathan some of the questions ahead of time, just so he could prepare.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We could have a little bit less dev check.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And yeah, I've tried really hard to not have any repeat questions, except for a few that I really want to push back a little bit on and talk a little bit about.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sure.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But yeah, it was honestly, it's been so many things that's been changing.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So while I'm making questions with Chad, it's been a little bit like, have they answered this?

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So like, it's, yeah, but very excited for this.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So I want to start with an interesting question for me personally, because PeeWee 2 is so different than PeeWee 1.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I don't know how familiar you are with World of Warcraft, but a big event there for me was the Gates of Ankara's opening with like, basically the server coming together and working on something and that affecting like a little bit of the future outcome.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So have you ever thought of doing a league like that, where the future of the league or how it goes core depends on how us as players perform during the league?

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
As a quick example, like maybe we lose the war towards Breach or we win the war and that like changes a future league.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's something interesting.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I feel like we did something like this before, but I'm trying to remember which thing it was.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wasn't it like Tempest, actually?

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Like, I feel like Tempest had a mechanic like this, but maybe it was like really not obvious.

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Like, it's actually the kind of thing I am interested in doing.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We just haven't really kind of ended up with a league design that kind of wanted to do it.

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because you have to be really careful with that stuff that you don't, like it can be frustrating for players just because, okay, probably not the thing you're referring to because that's the whole like coming together and actually like towards a single goal over the long term.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But we've had a few mechanics where playing the league affected before and I think Tempest was one of them where like, I think it was that one, where the more people who farmed something, after a certain number of people had farmed it, it actually, the mechanic moved us to another location.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, that's cool too.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And yeah, yeah.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So that was kind of interesting, but like, I think that we sort of decided for that particular case that we weren't like that happy with it.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Because I kind of had this thing of like, you know, the idea of unfairness of like, you know, oh, you have to like, someone says like, oh, this happened in the middle of the night.

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You need to wake up and do this.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And so we kind of weren't happy with that.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But I mean, like, I mean, the thing you were saying there about the gates, I mean, like, that's pretty cool.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I just like, I guess you then you have to be prepared for like both, both outcomes and then exactly what you're going to do in both cases.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like, it needs to actually feel like it had a meaningful impact.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, but it doesn't have to be the follow up league.

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All right.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It could be something that you do half a year later or something.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Like, say you say that we have to kill like six billion monsters.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And if we don't, like the league will be different.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Right.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But yeah.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I guess I'm also kind of into the idea, although maybe people aren't, of like, you create like a thing that once you've achieved it, unlock something for all players.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Like that kind of stuff could be potentially fun.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So I mean, there's stuff you could do there, but I don't have any plans for it in particular.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Like, I haven't actually thought too much about this kind of stuff.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But yeah, like, I don't know.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's kind of interesting.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll keep it in mind when we're doing the next league design for sure.

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Nice.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Cool.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So I have a few questions about stash tabs.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The first one is for things that don't have a PoE2 equivalent, like let's say Blight, right?

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Are we just not getting a tab at all?

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Or are we going to instead get like a regular premium tab or something like that?

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So currently you don't get anything.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And basically that's because we still want to be able to potentially add that content later.

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And then at that point, that tab will be, you know, for that league.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So if we gave you something now, then we'd have to like, I guess, read only the other.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If we gave you a bonus tab now, we'd have to like give you a read only one or something like that.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And effectively, the main thing is that we're trying to just make it so that where it makes sense, the thing you bought before will work.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So, yeah, I don't, I think that for something, the particular one you mentioned there.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I suspect that in the future, there'll be a time when that will work again.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And so you're kind of going to be good in that regard.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But I guess, I guess there, I guess it might be, it is worth bringing up though, that if we get to the point of like, literally, we're never going to use this ever in P2, I suppose we could consider like having a replacement tab or something like that.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But at least for the time being, like we still intend that a lot of that stuff still gets used anyway.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That makes sense.

186
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Now, the next question is also about stash tabs.

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And I remember at some point, there was a big discussion about consolidating normal tabs and letting people make quad tabs.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Now, if I recall correctly, the reason this didn't go through is there was a big issue with like database problems because we already have stuff in remove only tabs, right?

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
P2 doesn't have this issue.

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Is there a chance that we can like, for example, there's quite a lot of people like me that have a hundred normal stash tabs and would like to merge four at a time into a quad stash tab?

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Is that something that could be an option now with P2?

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Um, let me think about that.

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So it's certainly not something that we've done.

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I suppose we could potentially do that.

195
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I have to say that I'm personally not a huge fan of the quad tab overall, just because like, I understand the like gameplay utility of it, but it's just, I don't know.

196
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There's something about it that sucks a little bit to me of just about the way that it just, you don't really, I feel like you don't appreciate the items the same way.

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now, admittedly, if you're just playing the game and you're like, you know, like you don't care about this at all, right?

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Like I understand that you don't.

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And so it's fine.

200
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We've got that option.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But, um, yeah, it's just one of those things that I've kind of never really loved about it.

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Um, like it kind of makes the items just look a bit lame, but, uh, you know, whatever, as I said, I understand that in practice, like for a gamer, it's like, you don't care about this.

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Um, but, uh, yeah, like, I guess it's one of those that we just, I, we haven't done this.

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I, uh, guess we theoretically might be able to do that, but yeah, I, as I said, it's just not something we've done.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah.

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm, I'm a very big fan of the quad tabs and I actually, uh, it's funny you brought up Tempest.

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's actually where I ended up buying a hundred normal tabs because, um, the radiating Tempest and the 20XLs, I was like, and, and I was new at the time.

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And, you know, when you're new to the game, you don't want to get rid of everything.

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So, uh, the next question is, uh, we've seen on the PUE health bar that there are numbers now, right?

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So we have basically damage numbers in the game.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Um, so I wanted to bring up, have you thought about letting us have a literal target dummy?

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So we've thought about this for sure.

214
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Um, the concern that came up the moment we discussed the target dummy is okay.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What resistance does it, what resistances does it have?

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What's like, you know, like what, like, like all this kind of stuff, like basically they'd have to be stateful.

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Like how much armor does it have?

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
How much evasion does it have?

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Like all these things.

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So then we started getting into, okay, um, uh, like you'd have to have some way to set these values, right?

221
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You'd have to be able to be like, okay, I'm going to set up a target dummy with this particular amount of armor or whatever to simulate whatever boss it was.

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And then we're kind of like, okay, should we then have a thing where you can like select like, okay, here's, here's a boss that it's going to be equivalent to.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And then like, that would be how we could do stuff like this.

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And then we're kind of like, well, hang on.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
At some point you just got the actual boss itself.

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You might as well just use that.

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And then we're kind of like, well, like maybe the target dummy kind of then is like, not quite of like, it starts to lose its utility then, you know?

228
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So the whole chain of reasoning kind of came from all of that stuff.

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Like I do understand like where you're coming from though, if you're saying that's not good enough.

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I think you're overcomplicating it a little.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah.

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Right, right.

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So you reckon target dummy with no stats, so then you're good?

234
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Literally a target dummy with no stats.

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Like, and like, if you really, like, if you don't want to overcomplicate it, you could even have two, right?

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
One that's the equivalent of like, let's say shaper, right?

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Or literally just like one boss and one normal monster.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But even if all you give us is a target dummy with no resistances and no nothing, that is like already a lot better in my opinion.

239
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Right.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I mean, I'm definitely, like, I'm actually kind of like probably fine with this.

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But like, as I said, the main concern was that, so it's funny because like anytime you're discussing a feature like this, there's always all the questions of like, okay, so then what are people going to immediately ask for the moment we add this?

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And so that's how we end up down the path of like, oh, it's like going to require this or this or this or this and then all these things.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Then that suddenly the feature is killed because of like the feeling of overcomplexity.

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So I guess that's just sort of explain like how that sort of stuff occurs.

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But yeah, I mean, look, if you're saying it's fine with no, like with no stats at all, like maybe it's something we could consider doing.

246
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Like I'm not really opposed to it, to be honest.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah.

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I know a lot of people want it.

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There is a lot of people that don't as well.

250
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But yeah, I figured I'd bring it up.

251
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm just out of interest.

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So to hear the case for people who don't want it, like what do you think is really the behind that?

253
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Because I mean, I've heard this argument from some GGG people before.

254
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But as far as people in the community, like what do you reckon is the reason for like no target dummies?

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's see.

256
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm seeing so many people say I don't, or sorry, I do want it.

257
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Someone said we have POB, don't need dummy.

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It would feel too competitive.

259
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Right, right, right, right.

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Misleading numbers.

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm trying to like pick up.

262
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, they shouldn't be misleading.

263
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So long as the target dummy actually emulates a real monster, the numbers wouldn't be misleading, right?

264
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah.

265
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So then that's the argument therefore.

266
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And then that exact thing there is like, oh, well, that's why you have to have the ability to simulate a given actual enemy.

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Sometimes less info is better.

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't know.

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's hard to see like reasons for why not.

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah.

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Fair enough.

272
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Fair enough.

273
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The next topic is going to be a bit of a longer one and a bit of a discussion.

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I want to talk about what the current state of portaling out at bosses is and then talking a little bit about pausing and logging out as well.

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So basically, yeah, so you can't port a lot of boss fight.

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This was something that we tried for a while to make it so that you could port a lot of boss fights.

278
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But like, you know, you put timers and stuff like that.

279
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But eventually we're just kind of like, you know what?

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why are we even trying to do this?

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's just completely ban it.

282
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And then that way we don't have to worry about like all the potential kind of like rules and weird stuff about like, oh, you stand at this location.

283
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The boss can't hit you like random stuff like that.

284
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Like it just effectively removed a lot of a lot of potential exploits.

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I think that probably was just a straight up improvement.

286
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You know, there's been actually a few other changes we've made.

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Like this is something probably people will never notice, but you can no longer swap your gear in the middle of a boss fight either.

288
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's been now disallowed to.

289
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And like a few other things like this, like these are just things that like, once again, people probably won't normally run into if they're not trying to do some kind of exploit.

290
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But effectively, like we just want to make sure that like when you're actually in for a boss fight, you actually have like a proper experience.

291
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You have to actually overcome the boss without some kind of weird, a weirder forms of cheese that you might otherwise try to do.

292
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So what happens if let's say that a hardcore player goes in, they get 60% through the fight and they realize they can't do this.

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What happens if they log out and wait until the next day?

294
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So you can always you can always log out like resurrected checkpoint effectively or like log out and or log out and just wait for time.

295
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So like it's possible to get out of a boss fight, right?

296
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Like you're not locked into that forever.

297
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So that being the case, like effectively, like, you know, like if you know you're if you know that you can't do it, you can get out.

298
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And this is sort of an interesting question, because I know there are people who are kind of be like, oh, it would be nice if like once you've decided to do something, you're kind of committed to that action.

299
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But I just think that we probably didn't want to really go down that path because it would mean that like I feel like that would kind of probably feel a bit bad, I think.

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
OK, so the concern then.

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

302
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So just from understanding.

303
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So from from the first thing you said, I was under the impression that if I go into a boss fight, let's say I'm going to fight the shaper.

304
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Right.

305
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah.

306
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Either the shaper dies or I die.

307
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But but then that's not the case.

308
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, no, that's not the case.

309
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So you can actually like you can bail.

310
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That is the case.

311
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You can't portal, but you can choose to restart at checkpoint or like log out to back.

312
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Like if you if you if you log out.

313
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
OK, so if you just order for right, what will happen is when you log back in, you'll be in exactly the same place you were, which is like.

314
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But that's more that the feature there is more about like trying to make sure that you don't like lose your place when you're just playing.

315
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Right.

316
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And you just connect for a reason.

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

318
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But if you but if you want to choose to leave the fight, you can decide to do that.

319
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Like that is OK.

320
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,000
OK.

321
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And just another thing with that, by the way, is like I believe that the feature where if you lag that the game gets paused, I believe that did get done, which means that even if you just have like Internet lag, the actual server will pause while the lag is happening.

322
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So then regardless of whether you get disconnected or not, you're not going to die during the middle of an Internet lag spike.

323
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And I believe that it might be like 100 milliseconds or something like that is like like basically if you're like if your clients not responding for that amount of time, then if the whole instance just pauses and like we'll just wait until until you're good before we keep going again.

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah.

325
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah.

326
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So that's how that works, basically.

327
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But yes, you can leave.

328
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

329
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So could you walk me through the difference real quick?

330
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So will I be will I have to log out and wait 15 minutes or will it be hitting escape and then clicking like leave fight?

331
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah.

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So if you hit escape, there's a button there called respawn at checkpoint.

333
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And effectively, that will just mean that you can get at any time you can choose to do that.

334
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Now, obviously, the concern with that, like and we actually discuss this quite a lot internally about like should that be OK, because there was like a whole discussion with this of like the fact that there's just a button you can do to press this kind of like would mean that like, oh, you it's like if even if you see like a slam coming, you'd be able to like push escape and just like push that button before it arrives.

335
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And that is the case.

336
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But the thing is, if we required you to log out and wait 15 minutes, that would kind of be lame, too.

337
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like, I don't really want to like and the counter argument to that one was like, oh, but like that's at least more friction to actually doing this.

338
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And it's like, well, yeah, but then do you really want the strategy to be that you have to log out and wait 15 minutes?

339
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Like, it's just kind of lame.

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So in the end, we kind of decided to do the more, I guess, what I would call player friendly thing of just like, you know, that option is there for you.

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You can leave if you want.

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So effectively, yeah, in some sense, I suppose you could say that that's kind of equivalent to the old F4 you could do in POE1.

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah.

344
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But, you know, it's that's kind of where we ended up anyway.

345
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So just to confirm this, this does not kill you on hardcore, right?

346
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, I lost audio.

347
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Wait, wait, no, no, it doesn't.

348
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Sorry.

349
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, it doesn't.

350
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
OK, but let me just think about this because I feel like I'm just I'm just getting a memory suddenly of us talking about that as well.

351
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that's yeah.

352
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that's fine.

353
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah.

354
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But I feel like I remember the concern I would have there of why that would be a bad thing.

355
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And I know a lot of people are against Logout Macro.

356
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Right.

357
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And I actually thought it would be something like a two second portal you'd have to cast and then it would fully reset the fight and you have to go again.

358
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And the reason personally, I'm not a big fan of like having to commit is that you end up over farming so hard to the point where you go in and you know there's a zero percent chance of you dying.

359
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Right.

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Right.

361
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Like normal shaper for now.

362
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Whereas like if you can die, it's a lot more fun being able to go in before you're ready.

363
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So that's awesome.

364
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm very, very happy with that answer.

365
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I will I will mention, by the way, that there is a very old league flag.

366
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't know if it's exposed on the on the private league interface.

367
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It probably isn't, honestly.

368
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But there's a very old league flag that actually does enable a timer when you disconnect before you actually get disconnected.

369
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And so if we wanted to run a league that had that functionality of where like you have to commit to everything when you do it, like because you'll stay in game, we actually could turn on a flag that would allow that.

370
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So I don't know if you ever want to run a gauntlet like that sometime where you actually have to commit to something like that.

371
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That would be cool for a gauntlet.

372
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah.

373
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So that's something we could do.

374
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That'd be perfect.

375
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I think that's really good for a gauntlet.

376
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,000
All right.

377
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
A quick question as well.

378
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
In PeeWee 1, we have the six second disconnect timer.

379
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Is that accounted for with the hundred millisecond lag thing you talked about?

380
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
OK, so effectively, the six second disconnect timer is still like that is just like after six seconds of like you not being in game, then we just terminate the socket and you're gone.

381
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But because of the hundred millisecond pause thing existing now, effectively, the six second thing doesn't like really matter anymore because it's only important.

382
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Like because the instance is frozen anyway.

383
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So all that's doing is just making it so that like, look, at some point we have to give up on the fact that you're not going to actually be able to come back again.

384
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In theory, we could actually increase that time now because like there's really no downside to it being that long or even longer.

385
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So that would give longer for the internet to recover.

386
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But I mean, I guess we just haven't kind of done one thing or the other.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But the thing that's going to matter to you really is just the fact that after 100 milliseconds, instances paused, you're not going to die.

388
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And how long it takes before we like actually time your whole connection out is kind of not really as relevant anymore.

389
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Awesome.

390
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's super cool.

391
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't remember in whose interview you were talking about it, but you expressed some interest in racing again and saying that that's something you considered revisiting now.

392
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But obviously you're cognizant of the fact that it's not necessarily what's going to like bring people back or bring revenue to the company, right?

393
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And you are a company.

394
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So I wanted to suggest, have you thought about having a specific like battle pass maybe or even one singular item for racing and telling people, look, if there's interest, we'll bring back things like descent, etc.

395
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Based on how much it sells for, then like the racing community can literally contribute as much or as little and as there is interest.

396
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I think that's pretty interesting.

397
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I actually did have another idea like a long time ago, which I don't know.

398
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So this is a different idea, but we'll just see.

399
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm just going to pitch to see what you think about it.

400
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Because we never actually did this, but it was a thing that I was interested in.

401
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And that was the idea of like effectively like pay to enter races where it would be like, you know, like some number of cents to enter a race.

402
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And then effectively sort of similar to the thing that you were talking about there, I guess, except that instead of being for a whole season, it was just like individual races.

403
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And that was kind of an interesting idea that I was thinking that maybe people would be interested in.

404
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But I wasn't quite sure whether people in the community would like that or not.

405
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Like it kind of wasn't clear to me.

406
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And so we're thinking like, oh, like five points to enter a race.

407
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And then because of the fact that the rewards.

408
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So then effectively the rewards of the race would have to be like cosmetics, right?

409
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Because obviously we can't give you rewards in the form of anything that would be player power, given that you need to pay MTX currency to enter.

410
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But effectively the like the original race rewards were alt art uniques anyway.

411
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And like effectively if we remove the actual part where you get the actual unique out of it, we could do like like skins and stuff like that as part of the rewards.

412
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So we kind of discussed that.

413
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But I wasn't like whether I wasn't really I was just like very uncertain about whether the community would like to hate this.

414
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So I'm kind of curious to hear your idea about what you think of it.

415
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I mean, the battle pass is similar, except that it's more of a like one time purchase for a whole season, I assume.

416
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah, it's also I was thinking more of like, like, even if even if it starts out with like a cloak that you buy that isn't like this wouldn't depend on you being able to play or not.

417
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This is like if you want to see more of this in the future.

418
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm more of a fan of free entry and then having a way for people to support and just being open with like, if this is something you guys are interested in, this is how you can show that you're interested in it.

419
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
If not.

420
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Right, right.

421
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I well, the battle pass thing, the battle thing is sort of interesting because it already kind of is similar to how the racing structure was anyway.

422
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We get points and then like certain thresholds you get, you know, you get cosmetic.

423
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So it actually probably doesn't match more into it.

424
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I just mentioned the other one because it's something I thought of ages ago.

425
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I thought it would be interesting to see.

426
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But, you know, that is an interesting idea.

427
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Like the racing battle.

428
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's a it's actually a pretty cool idea.

429
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like I'm interested in this for sure.

430
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The main the main issue really with that is just that the amount of bandwidth we have for making microtransactions, which is what we need to make for this is honestly surprisingly low.

431
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Like we're so like it's so ridiculous in some ways that like for a company that makes money from cosmetics that we don't have more people just working on that stuff.

432
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah.

433
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But, you know, the we need to be able to create more stuff like that.

434
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And it's like to already get more people for making existing existing cosmetics.

435
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So, you know, if we had infinite resources to make that stuff, I would absolutely do something like that.

436
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I think that's pretty interesting.

437
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah.

438
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So it's just a question of, you know, where we get the time.

439
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah, that's fair.

440
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Awesome.

441
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That's just I'm such a big fan of racing and I know a lot of people are.

442
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Right, right.

443
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Wanted to bring that up.

444
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It is fun.

445
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I have a question from a community member in full caps lock.

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
How do character names work?

447
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Is it the same as PeeWee1 or is it hashtag 1254 where multiple people can be the same name?

448
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So obviously like our accounts are hashtag now.

449
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Are our names still unique?

450
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So we decided to just keep the names the same way they worked before in PeeWee1 for now at least.

451
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And the reason why is because so with account names, you never really have to refer to account names very much while actually typing.

452
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah.

453
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So we wouldn't have had to worry about all the concerns that come around having to like know people's discriminators and having to like, you know, worry about all that sort of thing.

454
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah.

455
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
With character names, there's a few other details.

456
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So one of them is that they expire.

457
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So you don't have the problem where the space just, you know, exists.

458
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I assume you knew that about character name expiration.

459
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I thought that was just done in waves.

460
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's not done in waves.

461
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So effectively one year after the character name is, sorry, after the character has not been logged into, it goes into a pool of names that someone else could create if they want to.

462
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And if they then do that, then the name gets expired for you.

463
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So effectively, like the, over time, like names will free up again.

464
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So that's the way that that works.

465
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's actually just a, as I said, it's just as soon as you haven't logged into a character for a year, that's when it's no longer.

466
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The character.

467
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Discriminator.

468
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Wow.

469
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Okay.

470
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So I believe, I believe that's how it, at least I think so.

471
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's been a little while since I thought about this, but yeah, I'm pretty sure that that's the way that one works.

472
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And yeah, so because of that, like characters don't have quite exactly the same problem as account names do.

473
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And as I said, the discriminator on character names would be more annoying because that's kind of how you know, that's kind of how you refer to people within, within the league.

474
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
So we kind of decided to do that.

475
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That being said, if it became like a real problem, I'm open to the idea of doing the whole discriminator on character name thing.

476
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It's just that it would mean that you'd have to then have a situation where it's like, whenever you're doing a whisper, you'd have to like, no, like, because you have to have like autocomplete for this, right?

477
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Like you can't have discriminated autocomplete.

478
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And then that means you have to have all the whole thing of like, okay, are they in a friends list?

479
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Are they in the guild?

480
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Are they in your party?

481
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Have they talked in chat recently?

482
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Have they whispered you recently?

483
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Like all of that stuff would have to go in the pool of things that you autocomplete for.

484
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And I mean, look, it's like how discord used to be, right?

485
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
When, when it had stuff.

486
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So there's basically just a bunch of work that you'd have to do there.

487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And I mean, we could do that stuff if we felt like we needed to, but we're going to try without for the time being and see how that goes.

488
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And, you know, like if, if it's like a real problem, then we can always change it.

489
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
There are some audio issues, by the way.

490
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I don't know if the mic's too far away or something, but you're cutting out a little bit.

491
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'll, I'll try that.

492
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Hopefully that did.

493
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Sorry about that.

494
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm not sure.

495
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's not too bad.

496
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's just a lot of people are cutting on it.

497
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Fair enough.

498
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Awesome.

499
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So another question with that are like, for example, I have the name Zizarin right now in PeeWee 1.

500
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Will I have that in PeeWee 2 or is it like fresh start from everyone and there will be a character in PeeWee 1 and a character in PeeWee 2?

501
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah.

502
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So the characters are separated in PeeWee 1 and 2.

503
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
The databases are just completely, completely independent.

504
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So you'll have to race to get that one, I guess.

505
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
All right.

506
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm not getting that one.

507
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Cool.

508
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So a few other questions about runes.

509
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So runes, they're obviously like replacing the crafting bench.

510
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Sure.

511
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yep.

512
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,000
In a way.

513
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And can you override them?

514
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Like, can I put in a new one over it if I want to change later?

515
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You can't.

516
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
So that's something that's...

517
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I guess we could potentially do, though.

518
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Like, I don't think I'm against it.

519
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'd actually have to talk to Rishi and Mark about whether or not we'd want to allow that.

520
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But currently you can't at least.

521
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So, yeah.

522
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm very curious about this because from my understanding, one of the main reasons that you wanted to remove sockets from gear was that you really wanted to have this new thing where you find a gear upgrade.

523
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You don't need to 16K.

524
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
You don't need to, like, get it exactly how you need it to be.

525
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You can just equip it.

526
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But I feel like...

527
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I actually love the concept of runes, but I feel like a little bit about how they systematically work sort of ends up cancelling this, right?

528
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Where I will not be able to actually pick up an item and, wow, this is an upgrade.

529
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I will have to fix my runes.

530
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Maybe I have to farm them.

531
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I see what you mean.

532
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
But I don't think it's the same because the thing with...

533
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So, a couple of things with this.

534
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
One of them is that when we're talking about the whole, like, pick up an item and having to change stuff, what that was mostly around is the idea that, okay, like, socket colors and so on, right?

535
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Like, it meant that you had to change, like...

536
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Either you have to chromatic stuff until the point where, like, you've actually got exactly what you had before, or you have...

537
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Which is, like, definitely way more annoying than having to just use a couple of currency items on your item, right?

538
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Like, chromatic-ing to get to the right state, like, could be very difficult.

539
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But the other thing you might have to do is just rearrange everything in your character and, like, oh, this goes here, that goes there.

540
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I like to use different supports or something like that, right?

541
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So, to me, that was, like, a much more arduous process than what this is.

542
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Because, effectively, you're going to have the currency that allows you to add sockets to items.

543
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's not hard to get that currency.

544
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Like, in the early game, it's a little bit more restricted.

545
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But, effectively, you're definitely going to...

546
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
As you go through the game, you're going to have that currency in abundance, I would say.

547
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So, I don't think it's, like, necessarily a problem, like, doing that.

548
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But, sorry, I felt like you were about to say something there.

549
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah, so, especially with resistances and stuff, I'm still a little bit worried about this.

550
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Because you don't have the ability to change that later.

551
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So, effectively, in terms of fixing resistances, the sockets are more of a thing that you would be worried about early game for those kinds of stats.

552
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Like, when I say early game, I kind of mean, like, during the campaign, right?

553
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Because during the campaign, you're like, okay, I've got low on this resistance.

554
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I want to get another one of those.

555
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
To me, at least, I've found that it's kind of not something that I'm too worried about overall, like, as I'm changing items and going up.

556
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Because as you're going through the campaign, you're finding new base types, you're getting new things, you're kind of constantly upgrading.

557
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And it kind of hasn't really ended up being a thing where I'm worried about that.

558
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
If you equip a new item and you're like, I've lacked this resistance, generally speaking, I'm like, okay, well, I'll add another socket or two to this.

559
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And then I'll get the resistance rune out of my stash and use that.

560
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So, it's kind of ended up being a thing where, like, just fixing that resistance tends to be a problem that you do after deciding to upgrade anyway.

561
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So, that's kind of been okay.

562
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And it's worth mentioning that with the runes, because they're kind of like, so at early game, they're more powerful than they are at late game because the values, there's only one value for each type.

563
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah.

564
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So, that means is that, like, early game, the resistances you're getting from one of these resistance runes is, like, extremely huge relative to the other resistance sources you would get.

565
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But as you get later into the game, the runes are less effective at solving that problem because the numbers are not stacking up compared to the mods you could get.

566
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And so, as you get towards the later game, the things that you're going to be wanting to be socketing are more of the soul cores, which have the, like, different mods that aren't kind of designed to fix those early game problems.

567
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And also, your character has more mods overall and is generally kind of, like, more in a good place.

568
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So, it really is, like, in terms of, like, fixing problems you have, it's more of a, like, you know, first sort of 30, 40 levels kind of type deal rather than after that, if you know what I mean.

569
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So, I think for that purpose, they work really, really well.

570
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And as for changing them, I suppose we could allow it.

571
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't actually see a reason why we couldn't do that, although, as I said, I haven't talked to Mark and Rishi about it.

572
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But I guess the feeling here is that because you got to choose it, it's not quite the same as feeling like you need to be able to remove the mod that you would have from one of the random sources where we have, like, some random ways to get rid of it.

573
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So, that was kind of the reason why we're thinking that it can go the way that it has.

574
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But as I said, I don't think there's necessarily a downside to allowing you to replace it.

575
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So, maybe that is fine.

576
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I just haven't thought all through all the repercussions of that yet.

577
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, I mean, for example, like, I normally play SSF.

578
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Well, I actually have been playing a little bit more trade lately, and especially for trade, right?

579
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You could see, like, a perfect item you want to buy of somebody, but they've, like, got these, like, garbage runes in it.

580
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So, I could see that being an issue as well.

581
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's definitely, like, I'm trying to go into PeeWoo, too, with the approach, like, I haven't played it enough.

582
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I'll see how it is.

583
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:32,000
But that is definitely something I'm very worried about, and hopefully something you'd be open to feedback with when we actually try it.

584
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Right.

585
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I mean, I'm definitely always open to the feedback of that.

586
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But as I said, I think from actually trying it myself, that hasn't been a problem I've run into particularly.

587
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But, you know, I guess we'll see how it goes.

588
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah.

589
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,000
That's fair.

590
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
How rare are, like, the...

591
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
How rare are the rarest runes, basically?

592
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So, the runes themselves are not particularly rare.

593
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You get them fairly often.

594
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Like, I mean, you'll get...

595
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I mean, in Act 1, you'll find four or five of them, probably.

596
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And then it only increases from there as you get more monster density and so on.

597
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
So, like, you're finding them.

598
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And generally speaking, like, if you're in Act 2, like, maybe there'll be a rune that you want that you don't have.

599
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But then by the time you're in Act 3, I would say you probably have the runes that you need.

600
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Like, they're generally available.

601
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's really the soul cores that are the ones that are, like, the, you know, oh, it's actually a struggle to find the ones you need of these.

602
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Like, because that's where the kind of, you know, the higher level gameplay is.

603
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Right.

604
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And would you say there are soul cores that are at the rarity of, like, Eternal Orb, Divine Orb, like, that type of stuff?

605
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I don't know the actual numbers, but I would definitely think so.

606
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Like, there's definitely...

607
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
There are definitely hard to find ones, for sure.

608
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Right.

609
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Okay.

610
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yeah.

611
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Cool.

612
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yeah.

613
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Awesome.

614
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Next up, how does, like, stacking ailment works for, like, stacking multiple of the same?

615
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Right.

616
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So, effectively...

617
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So, okay.

618
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So, in general, ailments don't stack, right?

619
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
In order to get the ability to stack them, there has to be some kind of mechanic you're getting.

620
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yep.

621
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Usually that mechanic will have some kind of...

622
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That mechanic may have some kind of explanation for, like, any specific details you have to be aware of.

623
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But I guess the main thing to understand is that if you're doing something like stacking poison, the way that that works is that

624
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
all of the...

625
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So, all of the poisons that you do will always be on the monster.

626
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yep.

627
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And they're all running.

628
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But whatever...

629
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
If you've got the ability to stack two poisons, then whatever the two largest poisons that you currently have that are on there,

630
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
those will be the active ones.

631
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And then when one of those falls off, then the next largest will take its place, effectively.

632
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So, that kind of means that, like...

633
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's kind of, I believe, sort of generally how the...

634
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Like, buffs work in PoE, where you've got, like, you know, whatever...

635
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
If you can have multiple buffs on a thing, but only one of them is active at a time.

636
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So, in the case where you're allowed to have more than one, it's just, effectively, whatever the highest in buffs are that are on the character,

637
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that's the ones that you get, effectively.

638
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Cool.

639
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Well, that's good.

640
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah.

641
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So, I don't know if there's anything else you want to know about that, but...

642
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
No, not that I can think of. I think that answers that. That's pretty good.

643
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Fair enough.

644
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Another question from the community.

645
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Does mana and elemental leech exist?

646
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So, mana leech is a thing, but only for attacks.

647
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yeah.

648
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And elemental leech, I believe, is a thing.

649
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
There are probably...

650
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I believe there are probably, like, various mechanics around that will give you elemental leech.

651
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's definitely going to be a lot harder.

652
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But what we're trying to avoid is mana leech for spells, because that can kind of, like, defeat a lot of mechanics and so on.

653
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So, effectively, that's the main thing.

654
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Everything else is fair game, but we just have to, you know, like, it just depends on where it comes from.

655
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So, yeah, that's kind of the basic idea.

656
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Okay, cool.

657
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah.

658
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I know a lot of people are hoping for a spell mana leech, so...

659
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah, that's the thing we don't want to do.

660
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yeah.

661
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

662
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Okay, next up, questions about...

663
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
A few questions about crit, actually.

664
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
In PeeWee 1, it's almost like when you're building a crit build, you're supposed to be 100% crit.

665
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Is that the same in PeeWee 2?

666
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I would say that it's kind of more like earlier PeeWee 1 how it used to be, where it's like you can get there with various mechanics.

667
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But I would say that it's like it may not be the most optimal thing to do, just because, like, the stuff you're sacrificing might be too much in order to do that.

668
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Especially when you've got, like, conditional crit mechanics.

669
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Getting to 100% isn't so bad, but, like, you're not always going to be meeting those conditions, if you know what I mean.

670
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So, yeah, I would say that, like, we've tried to kind of keep things a little bit more in line in terms of having more, like, as I said, just, like, controlling the sources a little bit better and kind of making sure that, like, getting to 100% is actually, like, a real, like...

671
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
As I said, possible, but kind of not expected.

672
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So I imagine this sort of expected crit would be a bit lower than that.

673
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And, yeah, trying to increase beyond that is kind of not hugely valuable.

674
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Okay.

675
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
What's the main reason there in difference?

676
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Is that just to, like, retain player power and not let it get out of control early?

677
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I wouldn't say that exactly.

678
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I think it's more just that, like, we...

679
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Ideally, every mechanic...

680
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
So, like, I'm just a general...

681
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I am generally in favor of the idea that, like, there's...

682
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The decision to not increase something more is not because you run out of sources of it, but because, like, there's a...

683
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,000
A...

684
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Like, a reason that you don't want to do that because the trade-offs are too much.

685
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And so effectively by keeping the values that you're kind of, like, can easily get to to a sort of certain midpoint, you just avoid the...

686
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Like, you just sort of make it so you get that trade-off, like, you have to make that trade-off towards the end of the range.

687
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So it's effectively like that.

688
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So I think that's kind of really the main reason.

689
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Like, it's been a little while since I talked about this with anyone, but, yeah, like, that's kind of really what it came down to.

690
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We just kind of wanted to make 100% crit more of a, like, this is a very unusual situation rather than this is a common situation.

691
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Okay.

692
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And do you think part of that is as well that, at least in Pee-wee 1, crit feels like the endgame.

693
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Like, you should go crit at some point and you kind of want to avoid that as well?

694
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Is that part of it at all?

695
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Well, we're certainly trying to make it so that crit is not the only build.

696
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
There was actually a thing that we changed.

697
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So, you know, here's a random thing for you.

698
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
We actually had the change for a little while where the...

699
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So crit modifies, and I need to get this correct.

700
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Like, there are various crit suffixes in Pee-wee 1.

701
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And so there was this feeling that in Pee-wee 1 that if you're a crit build, you've got, like, you can make your build more powerful than what non-crit builds can because the suffixes that are available to you as a crit build are, like, more powerful than what the suffixes are available to you as a not crit build.

702
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah.

703
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And so because of that, we actually decided initially to move crit stuff all to be prefixes as well to effectively compete with the other prefixes that you could get that all increase damage, right?

704
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah.

705
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And so we did this for a while.

706
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And we actually found that, like, it actually made weapon rolling way less fun.

707
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Like, in theory, what it was doing was making it so that, okay, you could get a crit weapon or you could get, like, a not-crit weapon, and, like, they were kind of competing with each other.

708
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
And we did all the math, and we're like, hey, look, now we've made it so that crit builds and non-crit builds are more in line with each other, and they have the same level of power and items and so on.

709
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And we kind of thought that we'd done a good thing there.

710
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And then at some point we just realized, like, why is it the weapons just don't feel as fun to find in Pee-wee 2 as they do in Pee-wee 1?

711
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And then we realized that, like, this is actually part of the problem.

712
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So we actually reversed that decision and moved the crit stuff back to be suffixes again.

713
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And we've kind of tried to make sure that the suffix pull is actually reasonable in other ways for the other builds, like making sure that the suffixes are actually, like, make sense and there's powerful versions of, like—

714
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Like, ideally it's, like, there should be an—like, there should be a level that each suffix can get to that is exciting, right?

715
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And so, like, the question we have to ask ourselves is, like, what is the amount of strength that if you got that as a suffix that you'd be excited about that?

716
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Yeah.

717
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And so effectively, like, we're trying to make sure that there's actually, like, at the high end there are suffixes that are actually really good.

718
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And so hopefully we've restored some of the, like, possible power that you sort of can get from weapons.

719
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And I think that's sort of a—I think it's in a better place.

720
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I don't really remember exactly how this was related to the original question anymore, but it was just something that came up in my mind.

721
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Does that mean that at the high end you don't want dead suffixes?

722
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Like, I remember life regen for a long time and thorns, right, would be literally dead suffixes?

723
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You still want to have suffixes where when you get them, you need to have bad roles, right?

724
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But at the same time, we did say that, like, okay, whatever—when you've got the higher tier roles, that there are actually things that—like, the highest tier of something needs to be something you actually would be excited to see.

725
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And there are actually a couple of cases where—so we—the tiering system for mods—sorry, for rares, like, you know how when you've got, like, you know, T2, 3, 4, 5—just goes up to 5—like, T5 rares.

726
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
When you actually—if you actually get a T5 rare, it's actually possible because we haven't got some of the mods, like Light Radius, for example.

727
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
They don't actually have an eye level.

728
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
There's no Light Radius mod that's higher than eye level, like, 60-something, I think it is.

729
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's probably like the highest one.

730
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It's actually possible that on the highest tier content

731
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
With a tier 5 rare

732
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
That the dead mods like that are actually cut out

733
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Of the mod pool completely

734
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So it's actually possible for that to be

735
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Now tier 5 rares are like rare as hen's teeth

736
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
They're actually like incredibly

737
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Incredibly rare

738
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So when you get one of those

739
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
You know the mods on those are going to be really really good

740
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Because you know the eye level of the mods you're going to get

741
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm so excited for that

742
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Okay so that means that there are

743
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Just like really

744
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Some really good stuff up there

745
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But yeah it's

746
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Once again I can't remember where I was going with this

747
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But this is like a thing that

748
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Exists for the rare system

749
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So that can mean

750
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That some of the rares you can get

751
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
On the higher tiers can be

752
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Very good

753
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Awesome very very cool

754
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm very excited to hear that

755
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Items is like my favourite thing in ARPGs

756
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So definitely looking forward to that

757
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I want to continue asking about crit

758
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Enemy crit in Path of Exile 1

759
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Can be a little bit weird

760
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
With especially like let's say multi

761
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Like the Volspark from like Tynevin

762
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Or whatever he's called

763
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Or the Shaper Balls and stuff

764
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Because either the entire ability crits

765
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Or none of it crits

766
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Is enemy crit functioning similar in PeeWee 2

767
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Or is it to the individual projectile?

768
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So I don't think we've made any changes here

769
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But I believe that the way that that works

770
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Is determinable by the designers

771
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
As they're working on it

772
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But I suspect it's one of those things

773
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That they probably don't necessarily

774
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Always think about

775
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Because it's kind of pretty

776
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's sort of somewhat invisible

777
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You know like so it's one of those things

778
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
That just probably just doesn't come up

779
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
In their minds

780
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So we can control that

781
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And I don't know whether or not

782
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And as I said the system works fundamentally

783
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The same as PeeWee 1 did

784
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I just don't know whether to what extent

785
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
They've actually like used the features

786
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That allow them to control one or the other

787
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And what situations that they would want

788
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
To use one or the other

789
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah

790
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Like out of interest

791
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Do you prefer the like every mechanic crits

792
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Or do you prefer just every projectile?

793
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I assume every projectile is what you'd prefer

794
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'd way prefer every projectile

795
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Obviously now I usually will end up building

796
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
For crit immunity instead

797
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And that's fine

798
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Right right

799
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But I remember when I was a new player

800
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
To Path of Exile

801
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And suddenly I'd be standing next to

802
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The Volspark Exile

803
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And it would just explode

804
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I'm like

805
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
What just happened?

806
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And somebody would like watch my clip

807
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And they're like

808
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Oh yeah he crit you

809
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You're gone

810
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Right right

811
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I have a feeling that

812
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I mean I suppose the question would be

813
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Whether we should make per projectile

814
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The default option

815
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's one of those things

816
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
That like I don't see a reason why we wouldn't

817
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'd have to talk to Mark about it

818
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But yeah that's probably reasonable

819
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I think that the

820
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I think that the whole ability

821
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Critting all at once

822
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Is actually

823
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Is the default for some reason

824
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yeah

825
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I think

826
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So I'm pretty sure

827
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
That if you run into that

828
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,000
It's because the designer

829
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Forgot to add the stat

830
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
That makes it so that

831
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's just every projectile

832
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,000
To that particular ability

833
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
So yeah that's just kind of

834
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
One of those random things

835
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But for player skills

836
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
It's like one of those things

837
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,000
That we really have to think

838
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Very carefully about

839
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Yeah

840
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Because there are kind of

841
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Reasons and not

842
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I mean like one of the ones

843
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
That is tricky for this

844
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Is Reign of Arrows

845
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yeah

846
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's like should every

847
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Should every projectile crit

848
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Or should every projectile not crit

849
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Now because right now

850
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Every projectile has its own crit role

851
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It means that if you use

852
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Like Sniper's Mark

853
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
On a monster

854
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And then you do

855
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Reign of Arrows on that monster

856
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Then you're almost guaranteed

857
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
To crit it at some point

858
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Just because it hits so many times

859
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah

860
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And that means that effectively

861
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The Sniper's Mark

862
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Is like using it with

863
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Reign of Arrows

864
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Is just like a complete win

865
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Because you're just

866
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Incredibly likely to actually

867
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Trigger that

868
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
And so then it's kind of like

869
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Well should we make it instead

870
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So that ability is like crit

871
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
The whole ability crits

872
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Or doesn't crit

873
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But then the problem with that is

874
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That it just feels super weird

875
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Like there's something odd

876
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
About the feeling of like

877
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Do a critical Reign of Arrows

878
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And then you start to think

879
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Should it look different

880
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So you can see that the whole

881
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Reign of Arrows is critting

882
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I don't know

883
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It kind of just has some

884
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Weird implications

885
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So we kind of decided

886
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Not to do it in the end

887
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But yeah

888
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
There is a reason why we have

889
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Both the abilities

890
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
To do in different situations

891
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah I get that

892
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I mean

893
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm definitely a lot less concerned

894
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
About the intricate workings

895
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Of how player crit works

896
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Because like

897
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The monsters aren't going to

898
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Complain

899
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah

900
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah

901
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
No it's a tricky one

902
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Definitely would be a fun

903
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I would be interested

904
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I should talk to Mark

905
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,000
About whether or not

906
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
We should just have a policy

907
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
In general

908
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Just everything a monster does

909
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Is always individual roles

910
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Like

911
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
There might be a reason

912
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
There might be a reason

913
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
He's against that

914
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But I'd be interested to find out

915
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I'm curious how you feel

916
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
About

917
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Bosses especially

918
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Critting at all

919
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Personally

920
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm a big fan

921
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Of like everything being static

922
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Right

923
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And like not having mods

924
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And not being necessarily variable

925
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Because like

926
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,000
There are some abilities

927
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
That like

928
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You know

929
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You're

930
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You're

931
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Basically effectively

932
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Mapping out

933
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,000
What you can tank

934
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And then suddenly

935
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You're gonna knock you

936
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,000
With a big crit

937
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And you're like

938
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh never mind

939
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
So yeah

940
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I'm just curious

941
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
How you feel about that

942
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Like

943
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Mods and crits

944
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,000
On bosses

945
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah I'm just thinking about

946
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Well okay

947
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So mods

948
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I think it's nice

949
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,000
To have mods

950
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Personally

951
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I think

952
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Because I like to have

953
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Situations

954
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Where you've got the ability

955
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,000
To

956
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Like

957
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It gives us an access

958
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,000
To

959
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Because

960
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
What having mods does

961
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Like on maps and so on

962
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Is the ability to make it

963
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So that a boss fight

964
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Can feel different

965
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
From a different time

966
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,000
You fought it

967
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Just based on what

968
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,000
The mods were

969
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
So I think that stuff's important

970
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That being said

971
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
We did like

972
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
The idea of having

973
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
The static bosses

974
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,000
For the

975
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Top

976
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Pinnacle content

977
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Just because

978
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That is a measuring stick

979
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That players can use

980
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Against each other

981
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So having that

982
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Be like a static thing

983
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Is kind of nice

984
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
So that's why

985
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I like the mods

986
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
As for the crits

987
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I can see your point

988
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,000
For sure

989
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Like that is an interesting point

990
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Like should we

991
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Crit at all

992
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
For bosses

993
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah that's just curious

994
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I guess I don't really have a

995
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I just don't really have

996
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Like I honestly

997
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Don't really have an argument

998
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,000
For why they should

999
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
To be honest

1000
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I guess the main thing

1001
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Would be just to make sure

1002
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You've got the variance

1003
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But then the answer would be

1004
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Why the players

1005
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Probably don't want the variance

1006
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So you know

1007
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah I don't know

1008
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I find that to be interesting

1009
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's not something

1010
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
That I've really thought about

1011
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Too much

1012
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I have to admit

1013
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And yeah

1014
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Like I see your point

1015
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,000
About not wanting to have

1016
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
The crits for sure

1017
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So yeah

1018
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's probably something

1019
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That I'll have a chat

1020
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,000
To Mark about

1021
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah I was just very

1022
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Very curious about the answer there

1023
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Because obviously

1024
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Like we can just get

1025
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Create immunity

1026
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But the feeling for me there

1027
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Is that it almost

1028
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Makes it mandatory

1029
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Right

1030
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And I feel like in general

1031
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Whenever something

1032
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Feels mandatory

1033
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Like remember the

1034
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Castle Nemesis

1035
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Taken

1036
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Immortal Call Days

1037
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And stuff like that

1038
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Like it usually gets

1039
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Like changed or removed

1040
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Right right

1041
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So

1042
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I suspect that the answer

1043
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Against this

1044
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Would involve

1045
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Basically

1046
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Like it's another

1047
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Like it's an axis

1048
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Of character development

1049
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
That we're removing

1050
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Like that's probably

1051
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The argument that would

1052
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Be made against it

1053
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So then the question is

1054
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah but I agree with you

1055
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That if something's mandatory

1056
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Then it's kind of like

1057
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,000
You know

1058
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Maybe why should it

1059
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Necessarily exist

1060
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So yeah I mean

1061
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Point taken right

1062
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Like I'm

1063
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
This is an interesting one

1064
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:43,000
To me

1065
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And I'll talk to the guys

1066
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,000
About it

1067
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Ziki wrote something

1068
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Really cool that I like

1069
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Let me see if I

1070
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Where did it go

1071
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Enemy crit should be

1072
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Conditional buffs

1073
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
You can see to

1074
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And react to

1075
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I think that would be

1076
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Really cool

1077
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Like

1078
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Let's say that there's

1079
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Let's use Shaper Slam

1080
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
As an example right

1081
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That if the Shaper Slam

1082
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Is about to crit

1083
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
It like changes the animation

1084
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And becomes maybe a bit slower

1085
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Right right right

1086
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
That would be really cool

1087
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That

1088
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Because that does change the fight

1089
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But like I love that

1090
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah yeah yeah

1091
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
That would be way cooler

1092
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,000
That's interesting

1093
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
That's interesting

1094
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Okay

1095
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It's for me the

1096
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I guess for me the big thing

1097
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Is that like

1098
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
They look exactly the same

1099
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
You have no idea

1100
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:19,000
If it's going to crit or not

1101
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah yeah yeah

1102
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
No I agree

1103
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I agree

1104
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,000
You know

1105
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And that's a very good argument

1106
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Like it is a very good point

1107
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I'd be interested to hear

1108
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
If

1109
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Yeah

1110
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
If Mark has any particular

1111
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Reason against that

1112
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Maybe he doesn't

1113
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Like it's

1114
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It is a very interesting point

1115
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah

1116
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Cool

1117
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
More questions about

1118
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Monsters

1119
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Do they still get charges

1120
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And if so

1121
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
How do they work

1122
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So charges don't have

1123
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Any inherent bonus anymore

1124
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Yeah

1125
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So therefore

1126
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Monsters don't currently get charges

1127
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I suspect it's the kind of thing

1128
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Where we might come up with

1129
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Some interesting thing

1130
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,000
To use them for

1131
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
In the future

1132
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But currently

1133
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
There's just no reason

1134
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,000
For them to exist

1135
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So they just don't get them

1136
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Cool

1137
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
A lot of people are curious

1138
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
About support characters

1139
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And how they fit into

1140
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Path of XL2

1141
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
For those that want to

1142
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Play with their friends

1143
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And make OP combos together

1144
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So I would say

1145
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It's sort of interesting right

1146
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Because what we don't have

1147
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Is the support character

1148
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And the way that

1149
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,000
POE1 had it

1150
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Where it was like

1151
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Just a literal kind of

1152
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
AFK

1153
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You walk around behind them

1154
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You don't really do anything

1155
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So I would say that

1156
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
For that

1157
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We still have things like that

1158
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
You've got scepters

1159
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And stuff like that

1160
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
That can give people bonuses

1161
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
But I would say that

1162
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Support characters

1163
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
In POE2

1164
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Are more along the lines of

1165
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I'm debuffing monsters

1166
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Actively

1167
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Or I'm

1168
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Setting up things

1169
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
That don't need to worry

1170
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
About the damage

1171
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
In order for someone else

1172
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
To take advantage of them

1173
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Like these kind of things

1174
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
So like you can make

1175
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
A support character

1176
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,000
That's kind of like

1177
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Ultra slow all the enemies

1178
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
You can make a support character

1179
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That will do things like

1180
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Place

1181
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Like place objects

1182
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
That other people can use

1183
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Or like

1184
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Or for example

1185
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Like make a character

1186
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That's like

1187
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Armor breaking

1188
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Lots of monsters

1189
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So that other people

1190
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Can take advantage of that

1191
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Things like that

1192
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So I'd say that

1193
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
That's kind of the role

1194
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Of that kind of stuff more

1195
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
But what we don't have

1196
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Is just like

1197
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I just reserve everything

1198
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And like

1199
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,000
You know

1200
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'm just like an aura

1201
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Like just a bunch of auras

1202
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,000
On my character

1203
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And that's kind of all I'm doing

1204
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So that's the kind of thing

1205
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
That we don't really

1206
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Have in the same way

1207
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Cool

1208
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Awesome

1209
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I think that generally

1210
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Answers that

1211
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Next up

1212
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
A little bit of a discussion

1213
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Of something that was

1214
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Brought up in a previous podcast

1215
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I have in my notes there

1216
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Talk about respeccing ascendancies

1217
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I don't know if that's something

1218
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You've like

1219
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Thought about

1220
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Or talked about more

1221
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
After the podcast

1222
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
With I believe it was

1223
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Unfortunately I haven't

1224
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Unfortunately I haven't

1225
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Had a chance to

1226
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
To talk more about this

1227
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
But I mean look

1228
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
As I said

1229
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's still on my mind

1230
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Is something that I know

1231
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Players are concerned about

1232
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So like it will

1233
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
We will definitely have

1234
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Another conversation about it

1235
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,000
For sure

1236
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah

1237
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But I don't think

1238
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
There's really anything else

1239
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
To say about it at the moment

1240
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Perfect

1241
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Alright

1242
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Yeah that's it

1243
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I'm obviously very

1244
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Pro-Respecting ascendancy

1245
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So

1246
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah

1247
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
My argument

1248
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Would just be

1249
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's a very early place

1250
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
To make a permanent decision

1251
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Sure

1252
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I understand

1253
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Yeah

1254
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay cool

1255
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
On to

1256
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Endgame like mapping

1257
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And things like that

1258
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
How much more rewarding

1259
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Should a difficult map mod

1260
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Like you know

1261
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Penetration

1262
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Or something like that

1263
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Be compared to

1264
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Chill ground

1265
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Or monster variety

1266
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So

1267
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I believe

1268
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That

1269
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000
So

1270
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's a very different situation

1271
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
In PeeWee 2 than PeeWee 1

1272
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,000
For this stuff

1273
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Because

1274
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The rewards

1275
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
From

1276
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Difficult mods

1277
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Are not necessarily

1278
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Like

1279
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,000
The

1280
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
The rewarding part

1281
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Of the map mods

1282
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Because we've got the thing

1283
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Where the prefixes

1284
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Are like

1285
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
The rewards mods

1286
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And the suffixes

1287
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Are the like

1288
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Bad mods

1289
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It means it's kind of

1290
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Separated those two things

1291
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Out a little bit more

1292
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yeah

1293
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Now there is still

1294
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
A thing where the

1295
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Harder mods have

1296
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Waystone

1297
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Drop rate

1298
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Increases on them

1299
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And so I believe

1300
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And I believe

1301
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,000
That the

1302
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Harder mods there

1303
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Do affect that

1304
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But I don't think

1305
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
That that is like

1306
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Quite so much

1307
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Of a big deal

1308
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Compared to

1309
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
How it was in PeeWee 1

1310
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Where like

1311
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,000
The item drops

1312
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Were heavily

1313
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Changed by that stuff

1314
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So like

1315
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I don't know

1316
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
That like

1317
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,000
As I said

1318
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It's a very different

1319
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Situation

1320
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Now it's gonna

1321
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
This is one of those

1322
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Things that I'm like

1323
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I really hope it works

1324
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,000
But I don't know

1325
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,000
If it will

1326
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
So I guess

1327
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,000
We'll sort of

1328
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
See after see

1329
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Like the dynamics

1330
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Of what people

1331
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Choose to roll

1332
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And how people

1333
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Respond to that

1334
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Are going to be

1335
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Very interesting

1336
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So like

1337
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah

1338
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I guess we'll

1339
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Just see how that

1340
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Goes

1341
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
But what it does

1342
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Mean at least

1343
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
With the current

1344
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Way the system

1345
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Works

1346
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Is that

1347
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It doesn't matter

1348
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Quite so much

1349
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
What the

1350
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Like the numbers

1351
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
We choose

1352
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,000
For how difficult

1353
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Those things

1354
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Are relative to

1355
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Like the rewards

1356
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,000
They give

1357
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Because as I said

1358
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,000
The rewards being given

1359
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Are mostly from the

1360
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Prefixes anyway

1361
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So yeah

1362
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I guess that's

1363
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Kind of related to that

1364
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Cool

1365
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah no I was

1366
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I was just curious

1367
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Because somebody

1368
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Brought up the point

1369
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,000
That I think

1370
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I think it was

1371
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Penetration and

1372
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Monster Variety

1373
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Had basically

1374
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
The same rewards

1375
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So I was

1376
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Curious there

1377
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So that'll be

1378
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Interesting to see

1379
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
How that changes

1380
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
What about

1381
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Things like

1382
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Slash Ladder

1383
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Is that going

1384
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
To be the same

1385
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Or different

1386
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It's the same

1387
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,000
For now

1388
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Look we could

1389
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Probably do better

1390
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,000
With this

1391
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Like you know

1392
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It's funny

1393
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Because before

1394
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,000
We

1395
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Slash Ladder

1396
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Was a temporary

1397
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Cheat we added

1398
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Before PeeWee 1

1399
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Was released

1400
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
As a temporary

1401
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Thing before we

1402
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Added the ladder

1403
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Screen

1404
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And then

1405
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And now we're

1406
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Releasing PeeWee 2

1407
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And we still

1408
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Haven't implemented

1409
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,000
The ladder screen

1410
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Like it's kind of

1411
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Absurd

1412
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
How that works

1413
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
But yeah

1414
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
We originally

1415
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Intended to have

1416
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,000
An in-game

1417
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Ladder screen

1418
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And then I guess

1419
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,000
The website

1420
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Kind of had it

1421
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And then we

1422
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Just never got

1423
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Around to

1424
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Actually implementing

1425
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,000
UI for it

1426
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Like so all I

1427
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Could say is

1428
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Like okay

1429
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It's been 15

1430
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Years but we're

1431
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Still intending

1432
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,000
To make a

1433
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Ladder screen

1434
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,000
In-game one

1435
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Day

1436
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So

1437
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
15 years

1438
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
From now

1439
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah

1440
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah

1441
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yeah

1442
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Sure

1443
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
At some point

1444
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,000
We'll get

1445
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Around to that

1446
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Cool

1447
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Okay good to

1448
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Know

1449
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And in a

1450
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Similar vein

1451
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
What about

1452
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Would it be

1453
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Possible at all

1454
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
For the community

1455
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,000
To get a more

1456
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Detailed

1457
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
API

1458
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
For things

1459
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Like that

1460
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Like Ladder

1461
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And like

1462
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Making your

1463
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Own tools

1464
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
So I'm

1465
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Curious what

1466
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
More you'd

1467
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Want out of

1468
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The Ladder

1469
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
For the

1470
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,000
API

1471
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Because effectively

1472
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I believe

1473
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That the

1474
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,000
API we have

1475
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Right now

1476
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Just gives you

1477
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
A full dump

1478
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Of the first

1479
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Like I don't

1480
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Remember how

1481
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Many it is

1482
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Is it like

1483
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
10,000 or

1484
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Something people

1485
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Something like

1486
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000
That there's

1487
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Like some

1488
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Number of

1489
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
People in

1490
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,000
The Ladder

1491
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,000
That it

1492
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Gives you

1493
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And as far

1494
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,000
As I know

1495
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It gives you

1496
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Everything you

1497
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Would need

1498
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,000
To have

1499
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
So yeah

1500
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
What else

1501
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Do you want

1502
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Right

1503
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Well

1504
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Like if you

1505
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Want something

1506
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Else

1507
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So you can

1508
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Add it

1509
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Yeah okay

1510
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh my god

1511
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
We can get

1512
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You a list

1513
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So obviously

1514
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Like I'm

1515
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah it's a long

1516
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Time since I

1517
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Started computer

1518
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Science so I

1519
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Don't have a list

1520
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
In front of me

1521
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,000
But things I

1522
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Can think of

1523
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Off the top

1524
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Of my head

1525
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Would be

1526
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Boss kills

1527
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,000
For example

1528
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Right for the

1529
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Events we do

1530
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,000
That is one of

1531
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
The biggest

1532
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Things we want

1533
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Like what

1534
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Oh so you want

1535
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
A ladder for

1536
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,000
When

1537
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Oh you want

1538
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Like a different

1539
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Ladder for when

1540
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
People have

1541
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Killed a boss

1542
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Not necessarily

1543
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Part of the ladder

1544
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Just like an

1545
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,000
API we can

1546
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Access for if

1547
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Somebody kills

1548
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,000
A boss or

1549
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Something

1550
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So you mean

1551
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Like but

1552
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So like

1553
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Do you want

1554
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
How many times

1555
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
They've killed

1556
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,000
A given boss

1557
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Or do you want

1558
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Like like like

1559
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Like have they

1560
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Killed the boss

1561
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,000
At all yet

1562
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah have they

1563
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Killed the boss

1564
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,000
At all yet

1565
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I think that we

1566
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Do have

1567
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Support for

1568
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Ladders of when

1569
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
People killed a boss

1570
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Because like don't

1571
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
We have that for

1572
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Certain events

1573
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I thought we did

1574
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Only for the

1575
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
First person I

1576
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Believe

1577
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I just I have a

1578
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Feeling that the

1579
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Way that's implemented

1580
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Internally is there's

1581
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Just a like

1582
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Effectively the

1583
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Amount of time until

1584
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
You kill the given

1585
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Boss like as a

1586
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Separate ladder

1587
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Effectively

1588
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And then that

1589
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Would mean that

1590
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Like you could

1591
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Effectively dump a

1592
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Ladder of that

1593
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Of like when

1594
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Was the who was

1595
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,000
The first person

1596
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
To kill a given

1597
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Boss

1598
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
So that's something

1599
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
We could probably

1600
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Do like relatively

1601
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Easily I will say

1602
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,000
We haven't like

1603
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Thought about this

1604
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
For a long time

1605
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So I can get you

1606
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Like from like

1607
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,000
The guy who made

1608
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Peewee racing and

1609
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Stuff I can get you

1610
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,000
A list of like

1611
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
API things that

1612
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Would be huge for

1613
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So obviously I'm

1614
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Very involved in

1615
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Loving and wanting

1616
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
To do events

1617
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Right right

1618
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
As I said I think

1619
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
We do have actually

1620
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Like boss time

1621
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Like time to kill

1622
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,000
A specific boss

1623
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But I'm pretty sure

1624
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
That what it is

1625
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Is that like

1626
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,000
That had to be

1627
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Specifically implemented

1628
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
For each boss

1629
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
That we wanted to do it

1630
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Because I'm pretty sure

1631
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That the reason why

1632
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
We had that was for

1633
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Like the original race

1634
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Seasons we did

1635
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Where we sometimes

1636
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Had like different

1637
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Objectives

1638
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Things like yeah

1639
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
First to kill

1640
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Ex-boss

1641
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So I think it's

1642
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Still lurking around

1643
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
In there somewhere

1644
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So we might be able

1645
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
To like resurrect that

1646
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And like it would

1647
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Be pretty cool to

1648
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Have a ladder for

1649
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Like first person to

1650
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Kill the pinnacle

1651
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Encounters in

1652
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Peewee 2 when it

1653
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Comes out for example

1654
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
We might be a little

1655
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Bit too close to

1656
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Be able to actually

1657
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Implement something

1658
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Like that but like

1659
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's possible that

1660
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
It's just like a

1661
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Matter of like

1662
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Resurrecting some

1663
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Piece of code

1664
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
That's been sitting

1665
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
There and turning

1666
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
It on so I'll

1667
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Actually look into

1668
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
That because that's

1669
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Kind of interesting

1670
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah is there going

1671
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
To be any form of

1672
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Like yellow text

1673
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Announcements for

1674
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Like first to level

1675
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
First to new areas

1676
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And stuff

1677
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Yes so I think

1678
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
That we have

1679
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So the leveling one

1680
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I think we only do

1681
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It every five levels

1682
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
At least for the first

1683
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
While just because

1684
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:33,000
We don't want it to

1685
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Be like super spammy

1686
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And for first to

1687
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Enter area

1688
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I think that

1689
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I don't remember

1690
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Exactly how that

1691
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Was going to be

1692
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I think because

1693
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,000
There was also

1694
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Some concern

1695
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I mean look there

1696
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Is definitely going

1697
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,000
To be stuff like

1698
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That but I think

1699
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
That we just wanted

1700
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,000
To try and reduce

1701
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
The spam a little

1702
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Bit in some cases

1703
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Certainly you want

1704
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Like first to reach

1705
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Level like past

1706
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Level like 65 or

1707
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Something you probably

1708
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Want like everything

1709
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Above that to be

1710
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Like every single

1711
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Level I would say

1712
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Just because like

1713
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
You know that's

1714
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Like that's pretty

1715
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Important race and

1716
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
It takes a bit

1717
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Longer up there

1718
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
So we've got

1719
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Something like that

1720
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I don't think

1721
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
There's any first to

1722
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Kill well maybe

1723
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
There are first to

1724
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Kill bosses for

1725
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
The act bosses

1726
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Or something

1727
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I don't remember

1728
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
The exact situation

1729
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But there's

1730
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
There's definitely

1731
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
There's definitely

1732
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Some of that stuff

1733
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
We just wanted to

1734
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Make sure it

1735
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Doesn't seem like

1736
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Completely incomprehensible

1737
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
For like a bunch

1738
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Of new players

1739
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
So seeing all the

1740
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Stuff for the first

1741
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Time so yeah we

1742
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Just kind of

1743
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Want to limit

1744
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It a little bit

1745
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Very cool

1746
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I love to hear that

1747
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
A question from

1748
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
My community was

1749
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Are there going to

1750
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Be free respikes

1751
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,000
During the EA

1752
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
If there's a big

1753
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Enough change

1754
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Like right now if

1755
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
There's a huge

1756
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Steel tree change

1757
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,000
On standard

1758
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You get like

1759
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
The free respike

1760
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah yeah yeah

1761
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So I'd say

1762
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It's probably going

1763
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,000
To be the same

1764
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
As that effectively

1765
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Like when we do

1766
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
A big change

1767
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Everyone will get

1768
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,000
A free respike

1769
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And it'll work

1770
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
That way pretty much

1771
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah

1772
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Cool yeah

1773
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Somebody was

1774
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Particularly concerned

1775
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Because if it's

1776
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Respiking is

1777
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Is it only gold

1778
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Or do you have

1779
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Silver guy orbs

1780
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I can't remember

1781
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
No regret anymore

1782
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It's just gold

1783
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Yeah so

1784
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
The guy was asking

1785
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Was what if

1786
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
A big change happens

1787
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,000
And your build is

1788
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Bricked and you've

1789
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Just used your gold

1790
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You just log in

1791
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And you're like

1792
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Cool

1793
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Generally speaking

1794
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Generally speaking

1795
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yeah it'll be

1796
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,000
The

1797
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Yeah like

1798
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
The big patches

1799
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000
That do the big

1800
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Balance stuff

1801
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
We should get

1802
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Now that being said

1803
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Like

1804
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I'm not going to

1805
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Say that every single

1806
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Like there will

1807
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Probably be patches

1808
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Where we nerf

1809
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Some particular thing

1810
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And then like

1811
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You know that could

1812
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Hit certain characters

1813
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Like that

1814
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
That'll probably happen

1815
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Yeah

1816
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Just because you know

1817
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I'm hoping not

1818
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But you never know

1819
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Yeah

1820
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,000
So yeah like

1821
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That might then

1822
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Cause a situation

1823
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Where you don't have

1824
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:31,000
A free respike

1825
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
For that reason

1826
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Because what we don't

1827
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Have the ability to do

1828
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Is like targetedly

1829
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Respec

1830
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Like certain builds

1831
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Or anything like that

1832
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Like so it's

1833
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Effectively all or nothing

1834
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So because of that

1835
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,000
The

1836
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Yeah like it would

1837
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Have to be

1838
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
A more global change

1839
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,000
To like you know

1840
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Oh look we've redone

1841
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,000
The skill tree

1842
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
In various ways

1843
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And then we'd

1844
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Probably do it

1845
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yeah

1846
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I'm guessing you can't

1847
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Go in negative gold

1848
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Right you can't

1849
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Like okay

1850
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Mr. Respec man

1851
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I'll pay you back later

1852
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
No no no no

1853
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Yeah no doubt

1854
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Cool

1855
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Another question

1856
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
From the community

1857
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Is we've learned

1858
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
That ascendancies

1859
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,000
And items

1860
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Can be supported

1861
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So a logical follow up

1862
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Is how many sockets

1863
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Do those start with

1864
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Do ascendancy skills

1865
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Start with five sockets

1866
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And do items with skills

1867
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Show you how many sockets

1868
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
They have

1869
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So if you have

1870
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Stuff that's inherent

1871
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
To your character

1872
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So that is to say

1873
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Like ascendancy

1874
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And ascendancy skills

1875
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Do count as that

1876
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Or things like

1877
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So for example

1878
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Default attack

1879
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Being also

1880
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Supportable skill

1881
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
These things

1882
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Level get sockets

1883
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Based on your

1884
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Character level

1885
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Now I don't remember

1886
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
What the level is

1887
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
That you get

1888
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
It's like late 80s

1889
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
There's like

1890
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
That's the one

1891
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Where you get five sockets

1892
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,000
For all of those

1893
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Things

1894
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Effectively as you level up

1895
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
You'll get more sockets

1896
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
For that stuff

1897
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
The ones that are

1898
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Inherent to

1899
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
To items

1900
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Those ones get

1901
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Sockets based on

1902
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The eye level of the item

1903
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So effectively

1904
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
A higher eye level

1905
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Base

1906
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
If that base comes

1907
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
With a socket

1908
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
That high level

1909
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Eye level base

1910
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Will have the thing

1911
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So I don't know

1912
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,000
If the trade site

1913
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Will show it correctly

1914
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Yet or not

1915
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
But it is based

1916
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Entirely on eye level

1917
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Which you can see

1918
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
The trade site

1919
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Needs like

1920
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Like

1921
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
The

1922
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That will probably

1923
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Take some time

1924
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
To fully be like

1925
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
100%

1926
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Like every single thing

1927
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
About it

1928
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Looking exactly the same

1929
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
As in game

1930
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Just because there's

1931
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Like a whole bunch

1932
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Of work there

1933
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But we definitely

1934
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Want to make sure

1935
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:17,000
The trade site

1936
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
At least shows you

1937
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Everything that you

1938
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Sort of need to know

1939
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
So I don't know

1940
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Whether or not

1941
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
They will be showing

1942
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
The sockets

1943
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
In

1944
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
That are in

1945
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Skills in gear

1946
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And I have a feeling

1947
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It probably won't

1948
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Because I know

1949
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
That skills in general

1950
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,000
On the trade site

1951
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Are kind of like

1952
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
A bit

1953
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Because there's

1954
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Like a ton of work

1955
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,000
To make them work

1956
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
The same as in game

1957
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I think we're just

1958
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Going to be showing

1959
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Like names and levels

1960
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So it probably won't

1961
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Show the sockets

1962
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
On the site

1963
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
But you can know

1964
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,000
That effectively

1965
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
There's just certain

1966
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Eye levels

1967
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
That the item is

1968
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
When it does that

1969
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And then later on

1970
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,000
We'll like improve

1971
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Support on the trade site

1972
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And get everything

1973
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Rendering exactly the same

1974
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,000
As in game

1975
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And that'll be fine

1976
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
But there certainly

1977
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Should be nothing

1978
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
On the trade site

1979
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Which you know

1980
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You can't know

1981
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
About something that's

1982
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Important for trade at least

1983
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Even to start with

1984
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Awesome

1985
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Quick follow up

1986
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
On ascendancy questions

1987
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
A lot of people

1988
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Ask me to ask

1989
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Regardless of the answer

1990
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Are we going to have

1991
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Like

1992
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Be able to see

1993
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
The full ascendancies

1994
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Before launch

1995
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Good question

1996
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I

1997
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Don't know whether

1998
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
That's in the spoiler list

1999
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Or not actually

2000
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
What we're not

2001
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Going to have

2002
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Is like

2003
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Support for

2004
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
On the website

2005
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Which we were

2006
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Planning on doing

2007
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Because we wanted

2008
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
People to have

2009
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,000
All that stuff there

2010
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
But I think

2011
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:25,000
We didn't quite

2012
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Get time to

2013
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Implement all that

2014
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Stuff on the website

2015
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:27,000
To get that working

2016
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It's possible

2017
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,000
We can still

2018
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Get them to post

2019
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The ascendancies early

2020
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I'll have to talk

2021
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
To the community team

2022
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And see whether

2023
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Or not that's planned

2024
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
We can probably

2025
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
We might be able

2026
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
To do that

2027
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Yeah I'll talk

2028
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,000
To the community team

2029
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And see what

2030
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Their plan is for that

2031
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
It is pretty much

2032
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
A 50-50 by the way

2033
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
On whether or not

2034
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
People want that

2035
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Oh yeah a lot of

2036
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,000
People don't want it

2037
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Right right

2038
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I think

2039
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:51,000
We did show quite a lot

2040
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
About their ascendancies

2041
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Already so like

2042
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,000
In some ways

2043
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Just filling out

2044
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The remaining stuff

2045
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yeah

2046
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
So yeah

2047
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I think the argument

2048
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
From people that do

2049
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Want it is that

2050
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Since it is like

2051
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
A hard lock thing

2052
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
They want to like

2053
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Have a little bit

2054
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Of info there

2055
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,000
And obviously

2056
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Most people really

2057
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Are appreciating that

2058
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Like there's

2059
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
We're going in blind

2060
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And that's pretty awesome

2061
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Sure sure

2062
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Fair enough

2063
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I'll talk to

2064
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
The community team

2065
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And see how they

2066
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Feel about it

2067
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So yeah

2068
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
We might do it

2069
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,000
We might not

2070
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Maybe just throw up

2071
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
A poll and see

2072
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:17,000
What more people want

2073
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
But yeah

2074
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Another question is

2075
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Is lowlife 50%?

2076
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
No it's 35%

2077
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And it's actually

2078
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Back to how it used

2079
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
To be

2080
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And the reason is

2081
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Because that was

2082
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Changed up to 50%

2083
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Mostly because of

2084
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
All the reservation

2085
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Related stuff

2086
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,000
In POE1

2087
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Which is not a concern

2088
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Anymore

2089
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So that means

2090
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Lowlife can be 35% again

2091
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
And that restores

2092
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
That to how it was before

2093
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Okay interesting

2094
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I was really curious

2095
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:44,000
About that

2096
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And we were trying

2097
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:45,000
To figure out

2098
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
What it was

2099
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Cool

2100
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Force move

2101
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Is that something

2102
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
That can be a keybind

2103
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Instead of taking up

2104
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,000
A skill slot?

2105
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
So it works the same way

2106
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,000
As POE1

2107
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I guess that the

2108
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Thought behind

2109
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,000
With that

2110
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Is just like

2111
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Most people probably

2112
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Want force move

2113
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
On left click anyway

2114
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Right?

2115
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Not necessarily

2116
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I mean

2117
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I guess maybe not

2118
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Like I suppose

2119
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
We could change that

2120
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But hang on

2121
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Can't you

2122
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Okay

2123
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
So

2124
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Can't you change

2125
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Like

2126
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Because you know

2127
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
The skillbinds

2128
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
That are like

2129
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Control W

2130
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And stuff like that?

2131
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah

2132
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Like you can

2133
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
You can change those

2134
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
To not be using

2135
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Control right?

2136
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Yes you can change

2137
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
All your keybinds

2138
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
The main issue

2139
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
For a lot of people

2140
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Right now

2141
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Is

2142
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
They would like to have

2143
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
In just keybind settings

2144
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Force move

2145
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,000
To be like

2146
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Whether you put it

2147
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
On mouse button 1 or not

2148
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Right now

2149
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It's costing you

2150
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
A skill slot

2151
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,000
And we're already

2152
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
A little bit

2153
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
For some builds

2154
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:41,000
A little bit

2155
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Short on that

2156
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I would

2157
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I would have thought

2158
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That when you include

2159
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,000
The control

2160
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Like they're more inconvenient

2161
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
But like the control Q

2162
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Control W

2163
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
That kind of stuff

2164
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Those ones

2165
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Like

2166
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Are you really using

2167
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
All of those as well?

2168
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Because I feel like

2169
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
You could just use

2170
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
The like skill slot

2171
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
10 or whatever

2172
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Whatever the last one is

2173
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Like at the end there

2174
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And then use that one

2175
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
As your force move

2176
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And then just rebind it

2177
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,000
To something that doesn't

2178
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Require prison control

2179
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And then if you do that

2180
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
You should be able to use that

2181
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,000
But like I mean

2182
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I guess there's no real reason

2183
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
We couldn't change it

2184
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
To not use a skill slot

2185
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Potentially but

2186
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I guess I figure that

2187
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's not usually a problem

2188
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
At the moment

2189
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
If you're able to do that

2190
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
A lot of people want that

2191
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
For sure

2192
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Okay

2193
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Interesting

2194
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Well I mean look

2195
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I'll table it with the UI guys

2196
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And see if they want to do it then

2197
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Yeah

2198
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Also pretty small sample size

2199
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
But I polled the people

2200
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Watching on Twitch right now

2201
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And 77% are saying

2202
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
They do want to know

2203
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I actually thought it would be

2204
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
More people against

2205
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Interesting

2206
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Yeah so

2207
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Do with that what you will

2208
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
That's an interesting

2209
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Point to have

2210
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Yeah

2211
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Yeah curious

2212
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Right

2213
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I would like to hear

2214
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
A little bit more

2215
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
About towers

2216
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And like buffing

2217
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
The maps

2218
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And like

2219
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Yeah yeah sure

2220
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:45,000
If you can talk about that

2221
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
A little bit

2222
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Because before

2223
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
The vibe I was getting

2224
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
As a player

2225
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
It's felt

2226
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
A little bit

2227
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Like synthesis like

2228
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Where I would be like

2229
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Trying really hard

2230
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,000
To maximize

2231
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
My area

2232
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And buffing it up

2233
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And that could

2234
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Maybe sound a little tedious

2235
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
So yeah

2236
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I would love to hear you

2237
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Talk about towers more

2238
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Yeah so effectively

2239
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So you unlock towers

2240
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
The towers are

2241
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
There's quite a few around

2242
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So you can always like

2243
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And the radius

2244
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Is actually quite large

2245
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And what that means

2246
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Is that generally speaking

2247
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The amount of

2248
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Things that get added

2249
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Like the amount of breaches

2250
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
For example

2251
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,000
That you add

2252
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
When you use a breach tablet

2253
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Generally speaking

2254
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You're going to be

2255
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Add

2256
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
There's more in radius

2257
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
That could receive the breach

2258
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Than the number that

2259
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Than the number

2260
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Than the number

2261
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:27,000
That it's going to be adding

2262
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Okay

2263
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
So for that reason

2264
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Like

2265
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I know there was some concern

2266
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Like there was some concern

2267
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,000
That we had initially

2268
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
That like

2269
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Because you have to

2270
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Like run maps

2271
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
To get to the tower

2272
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:37,000
In the first place

2273
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You're effectively consuming

2274
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Some of the maps

2275
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
You would have been able to use

2276
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
You know

2277
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
That would have gotten buffed

2278
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And that is true

2279
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
But because the radius

2280
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Is so large

2281
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And because like

2282
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
The number that will add

2283
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Of breaches

2284
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
That might add

2285
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Might be like six or something

2286
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Or you know

2287
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Six, seven

2288
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Something like that

2289
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
It means that

2290
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Generally speaking

2291
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
There will always be more maps

2292
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
In the radius

2293
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Even ones you haven't run yet

2294
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Than what you add

2295
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Okay

2296
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
In terms of adding them

2297
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
To overlapping stuff

2298
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Like

2299
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Because there's overlapping towers

2300
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
You can still get a situation

2301
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Where

2302
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Like you want to try

2303
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And maximize this

2304
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Yeah

2305
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
But

2306
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And yes

2307
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You can only add one

2308
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Use each tower one time

2309
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So effectively

2310
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Like you know

2311
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You want to

2312
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Find the tower

2313
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Like go to it

2314
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Add whatever mechanic

2315
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,000
You're adding

2316
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Find some nearby towers

2317
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Potentially

2318
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
If there are nearby ones

2319
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Use those as well

2320
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Like add them all

2321
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And then once you've done that

2322
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
You get the overlapping radii

2323
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
For the mods

2324
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And then

2325
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And then

2326
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Then you run them

2327
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So effectively

2328
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
It works like that

2329
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Okay

2330
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So yeah

2331
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I mean if you've got

2332
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Any specific questions

2333
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,000
About it

2334
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I can certainly answer them

2335
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Well can you use towers

2336
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Multiple times?

2337
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
No you can't

2338
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So just one time each

2339
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Honestly

2340
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
It's hard

2341
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Because again

2342
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I haven't played

2343
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Which I love

2344
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I love that I haven't played

2345
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I would just like

2346
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Do you like it?

2347
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Like is it fun?

2348
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Like is it something

2349
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
You're confident

2350
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
That you think people will enjoy?

2351
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I mean

2352
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I think it's pretty fun

2353
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Yeah

2354
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I think it's pretty fun

2355
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But it's kind of like

2356
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Look it's one of those things

2357
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
We'll just have to see

2358
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,000
How it works in some ways

2359
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Like I

2360
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
What we don't really know

2361
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Is like what the long term

2362
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Feel of it is

2363
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Like when you actually

2364
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Really ramp everything

2365
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
To like max

2366
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And with

2367
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,000
You know

2368
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Like

2369
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
But

2370
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Like what's the steady state like

2371
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Once you've reached the like

2372
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Point of just grinding forever

2373
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And that I sort of

2374
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Have a hard time knowing

2375
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Like we

2376
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
We haven't done

2377
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Like

2378
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
The amount of time

2379
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
We need to invest

2380
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
To be able to really test that

2381
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Is like more than what we have

2382
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
So it's kind of hard

2383
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
For us to know that

2384
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
But the actual

2385
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Just like when you just

2386
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Play it normally

2387
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Like it's cool

2388
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Like it does work well

2389
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And I'm enjoying that

2390
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
The hard part

2391
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Yeah as I said

2392
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
The hard part to know

2393
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Will be like

2394
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Once you've got infinite resources

2395
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And you can just like

2396
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
You know

2397
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
You've got as much

2398
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Will it feel bad then

2399
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
And I'm not sure about that

2400
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm hoping not though

2401
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
There are generic tablets

2402
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,000
As well by the way

2403
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
That don't

2404
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Relate to a specific mechanic

2405
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
And those ones

2406
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Like add more general mods

2407
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
That just sort of

2408
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Affect all maps

2409
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
So that's another thing as well

2410
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Just so you know

2411
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
So yeah yeah

2412
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So we've got that too

2413
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
That's very fun

2414
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And I'm sure

2415
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I am sure that we're going

2416
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
To be playing around a lot

2417
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,000
With the mod pulls

2418
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And other things like this

2419
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And sort of like

2420
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
You know

2421
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Like affecting the

2422
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Juicing experience

2423
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Is definitely something

2424
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
That needs a lot more

2425
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Actual testing

2426
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
To really know

2427
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Like how well that

2428
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
How far that goes

2429
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And how well it works

2430
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So I'm sure

2431
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,000
That will be an area

2432
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
That receives heavy balance

2433
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
As we're going through EA

2434
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Yeah

2435
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I mean that's the beauty

2436
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Of doing early access

2437
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I guess

2438
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I was yesterday

2439
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,000
On a podcast

2440
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Called Dropped Frames

2441
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And

2442
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Ko and JP asked

2443
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Ezekiel

2444
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
To make them a question

2445
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
For today's podcast

2446
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That I said

2447
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I would ask them

2448
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And Ezekiel asked

2449
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Why was it a conscious choice

2450
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
To make the game

2451
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
More difficult than Pee Wee 1

2452
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So

2453
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
See I guess I

2454
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Don't know that I would say

2455
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
That the conscious choice

2456
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Was to make the game

2457
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,000
More difficult

2458
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
As the

2459
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Because that makes it sound

2460
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Like the goal

2461
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Is we're going to make

2462
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,000
It more difficult

2463
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Whereas what the goal was

2464
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Was to make the combat

2465
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
More engaging

2466
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And on some level

2467
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
That did make the game

2468
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
More difficult

2469
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,000
But I wouldn't say

2470
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
That was like

2471
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
This is what we're

2472
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Setting out to do

2473
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
If you know what I mean

2474
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
It's like we're setting out

2475
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
To make the combat good

2476
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And

2477
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
To me at least

2478
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Good combat

2479
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Yeah

2480
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Involves some level of challenge

2481
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And so that's kind of

2482
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:04,000
What you end up with

2483
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
So yeah I guess

2484
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
That's kind of what I

2485
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,000
That's what it really

2486
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Comes down to

2487
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It's just yeah

2488
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Like that's just

2489
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
It's a natural part of that

2490
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Cool

2491
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I think that yeah

2492
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I think that really

2493
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
That's really what it is

2494
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yeah

2495
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Engaging combat

2496
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
That makes sense

2497
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
A cat in the community asked

2498
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Will every attack

2499
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
From rapid fire

2500
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Give stacks of tailwind

2501
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
So it currently does

2502
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I know there was a discussion

2503
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Happening about this

2504
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
One of the designers

2505
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Was unhappy about it

2506
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,000
And so

2507
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I think that

2508
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I know there was

2509
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
A discussion recently

2510
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,000
That I haven't heard

2511
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
The result of

2512
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
About what's going on

2513
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,000
With that

2514
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
So I don't

2515
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I actually can't answer

2516
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
What the final state

2517
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Will be because

2518
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Yeah I don't know

2519
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It depends on what

2520
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,000
They went off and did

2521
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
But yeah there was

2522
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
A discussion about it

2523
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,000
For sure

2524
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
It was a balanced concern

2525
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
That's what I know

2526
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Yeah

2527
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I think that's why

2528
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
They were curious

2529
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I've seen a lot of

2530
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Theory crafting and stuff

2531
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Yeah

2532
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Yeah so we

2533
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
We have a few more

2534
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Reddit questions here

2535
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I think we have

2536
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
A few thousand questions

2537
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,000
From Reddit

2538
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
So I've just tried

2539
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Calling them

2540
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
This was one I found

2541
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Very interesting

2542
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And it was

2543
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
It's pretty rare

2544
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
To see someone so motivated

2545
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
After doing something

2546
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,000
For so long

2547
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Can you talk about

2548
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
What makes you so motivated

2549
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I guess for me

2550
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I just want to make

2551
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Like

2552
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I want to actually

2553
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Make a game I'm happy with

2554
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
And

2555
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Until I've actually done that

2556
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I think I won't be happy

2557
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
You know what I mean

2558
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Like I just want to keep going

2559
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Like I

2560
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I was

2561
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I was never fully happy

2562
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
With PeeWee 1

2563
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
There was always more to do

2564
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
It's always like

2565
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You know like

2566
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
We're still in a good place yet

2567
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And yeah

2568
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I just

2569
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I want to make that

2570
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Perfect action RPG

2571
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
So

2572
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'll

2573
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:41,000
That's

2574
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I'll just keep going

2575
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Until I've achieved that

2576
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Right

2577
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And maybe that

2578
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Maybe that's impossible

2579
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
To like make something

2580
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Really truly perfect

2581
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
But like

2582
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I

2583
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I guess I'm just

2584
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Ultimately motivated

2585
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,000
To fix things

2586
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Like I want

2587
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
You know

2588
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I just want everything

2589
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
To be perfect

2590
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And so

2591
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
You know

2592
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:58,000
The

2593
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
We keep going

2594
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Until we get to that point

2595
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Which maybe is impossible

2596
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
As far as I know

2597
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
That's what's driving me really

2598
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Yeah

2599
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That's awesome

2600
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
That's a great answer

2601
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I mean it's very

2602
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,000
There's like

2603
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Talking to you as well

2604
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
It's very fun

2605
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So it's

2606
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,000
It's great

2607
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Keep it up

2608
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Next question

2609
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Is

2610
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Does hardcore

2611
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Still go to softcore

2612
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Yes

2613
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It works the same

2614
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
As POE1

2615
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
So

2616
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Effectively

2617
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I was thinking about

2618
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Actually starting

2619
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Softcore this time

2620
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
But I could effectively

2621
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Just start playing

2622
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,000
On hardcore

2623
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Die and just continue

2624
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
On softcore then

2625
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Yeah

2626
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Absolutely

2627
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Okay

2628
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I'll do that then

2629
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Yeah sure

2630
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I mean

2631
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Hopefully that will happen

2632
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
By the time you're

2633
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Like three areas in

2634
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Okay

2635
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But we'll see

2636
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
We'll see

2637
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Damn

2638
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Alright

2639
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Oh wow

2640
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
So

2641
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So like

2642
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Yeah

2643
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
How hardcore

2644
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Vival do you think

2645
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It is for your first time

2646
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I think that would be

2647
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I think

2648
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I think it probably

2649
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Would really not be

2650
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Hardcore viable

2651
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Just because there's

2652
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Going to be mechanics

2653
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
On bosses that you're

2654
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Going to need to learn

2655
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
That being said

2656
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Look I mean

2657
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
You can

2658
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
With enough grinding

2659
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:05,000
And like you know

2660
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
If you're just

2661
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
If you really over

2662
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Prepare for everything

2663
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Right

2664
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
You obviously can be

2665
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Very

2666
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You know

2667
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You can

2668
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
You can be successful

2669
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
But yeah

2670
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Like if you're

2671
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Playing at a regular pace

2672
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Like you know

2673
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Bosses will kill you

2674
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Just due to like

2675
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,000
You know

2676
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Learn the mechanics

2677
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Like there are

2678
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,000
There are things

2679
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
That are subtle

2680
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,000
About them

2681
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And you know

2682
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
You have to work them out

2683
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Or you know

2684
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Like obviously

2685
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Like you've never seen

2686
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Like everything

2687
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Is very well telegraphed

2688
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But like if you don't know

2689
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
What is telegraphing

2690
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You know

2691
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Like until you've seen

2692
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
The ability one time

2693
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
You know

2694
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
What I would say is

2695
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
If you were like

2696
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Playing behind someone

2697
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And every single boss fight

2698
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
You like watched a video

2699
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Of someone playing it first

2700
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Before you

2701
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Before you fought it

2702
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
In hardcore

2703
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Yeah

2704
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I think you could probably

2705
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Do it that way

2706
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
But where's the fun

2707
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,000
On that right

2708
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Like you want to experience

2709
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
All the stuff

2710
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,000
For the first time yourself

2711
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
So that I would say

2712
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,000
You can do

2713
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So yeah

2714
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That's

2715
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I would say

2716
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Play softcore your first time

2717
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Or at least play hardcore

2718
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And die

2719
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And then play softcore

2720
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
The rest

2721
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And you should be alright

2722
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Yeah

2723
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
No I was actually

2724
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Like bouncing between

2725
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Which one I should do

2726
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
And then it was finally

2727
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Ben that convinced me

2728
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
That I should play softcore

2729
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Because of server issues

2730
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And I think that

2731
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Obviously

2732
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:07,000
That is something

2733
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
We're all concerned about

2734
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So

2735
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I have a feeling

2736
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Like if there are

2737
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Server issues

2738
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
It probably won't be

2739
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
That like

2740
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It's like lag server side

2741
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
On the individual

2742
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Like on an individual

2743
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Instance

2744
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It's much more likely

2745
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,000
To be like

2746
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Backend problems

2747
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Which like boot off

2748
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,000
You know

2749
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
100,000 people

2750
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Get booted off

2751
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Kind of thing

2752
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
That's kind of

2753
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Like a different type

2754
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,000
You know

2755
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Rather than like

2756
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
A you know

2757
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Like oh it's just like

2758
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Just crappy performance

2759
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Like I would hope anyway

2760
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I mean you never really know

2761
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
But like I just have a feeling

2762
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
It was much more likely

2763
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
To be those kinds of problems

2764
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Like the like

2765
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Horrible back end issue

2766
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
That I have to get up

2767
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Before at 2am

2768
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
To work out

2769
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Rather than the like

2770
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Just slow grind

2771
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yeah

2772
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Hopefully we're able

2773
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,000
To solve that issue

2774
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
How confident are you feeling?

2775
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Um

2776
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Like

2777
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
It's hard

2778
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Apparently not very

2779
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,000
If I'm

2780
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Yeah

2781
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
If I'm saying like that

2782
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
The issue is

2783
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Is just like

2784
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,000
You know

2785
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I really have no idea

2786
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,000
How many people

2787
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Will turn up on day one

2788
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Like we can look

2789
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
At supporter pack sales

2790
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
And we can say like

2791
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Okay well there's at least

2792
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
There's at least this number

2793
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
But on day one

2794
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
You know

2795
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
We're not sure

2796
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And the other thing as well

2797
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Is that there are things like

2798
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
What's console gonna be like

2799
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I just don't know

2800
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Really

2801
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Like how many people

2802
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Will turn up there

2803
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
It's really hard to say

2804
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Um

2805
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
The

2806
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Uh

2807
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Yeah

2808
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I

2809
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I

2810
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
It's very hard to feel confidence

2811
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Even though we're doing

2812
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,000
A bunch of testing

2813
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And things like that

2814
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Just because like

2815
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,000
You know

2816
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,000
As I said

2817
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It's a new game

2818
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,000
You never know

2819
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
What's gonna happen

2820
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Like

2821
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Launches are just like

2822
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Notorious

2823
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
For like

2824
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Random issues

2825
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Right

2826
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And um

2827
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
It's not for lack

2828
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Of people trying

2829
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Uh

2830
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,000
To make sure

2831
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Like

2832
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,000
You know

2833
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,000
It's not like

2834
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
We're like

2835
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Oh you know

2836
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Just cheaping out

2837
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
On servers

2838
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Or something like that

2839
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Right

2840
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Like we

2841
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
We will do our best

2842
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:43,000
To get as much

2843
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
As we can

2844
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,000
But you just

2845
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,000
It's

2846
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
You just never know

2847
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Uh

2848
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,000
What kind of

2849
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Random performance

2850
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Or should go wrong

2851
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And the

2852
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
The sucky thing about it

2853
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Is like

2854
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,000
You can make some

2855
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Really subtle mistakes

2856
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Somewhere

2857
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And it results

2858
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:53,000
In like

2859
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
A huge amount

2860
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Of chaos

2861
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
For the players

2862
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Because like

2863
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,000
You know

2864
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You go over

2865
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Some weird threshold

2866
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,000
And you get

2867
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Some deadlock

2868
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Or some

2869
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Some

2870
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Some random thing

2871
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Happens

2872
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And it just

2873
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,000
It just

2874
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Everything dies

2875
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And so

2876
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Yeah

2877
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,000
That kind of stuff

2878
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Really sucks

2879
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Um

2880
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I just

2881
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Yeah

2882
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I really

2883
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I really hope

2884
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,000
We can do well

2885
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I mean

2886
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
The nice thing

2887
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Is at least

2888
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Is that

2889
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
You know

2890
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,000
It's all based

2891
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
On POE1

2892
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Back and stuff

2893
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Like that's been

2894
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Tested to a

2895
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Pretty reasonable

2896
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Degree by this point

2897
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Yeah

2898
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
You know

2899
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I think we can do okay

2900
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
But in the other

2901
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
On the other hand

2902
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
We may get more players

2903
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Than what our back end

2904
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Has ever dealt with before

2905
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
And I think it's very

2906
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Very likely at this point

2907
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,000
That that will happen

2908
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Um

2909
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
So uh

2910
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,000
You know

2911
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
As I said

2912
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
You can never really know

2913
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
I don't know if you're like

2914
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Have to be sharing a number

2915
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
You're prepared for

2916
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
But like

2917
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Um

2918
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Are you prepared for like

2919
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
A million players for example

2920
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:35,000
If that's something you're

2921
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Well a million

2922
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
A million is how many

2923
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Uh

2924
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Is what we're prepared for

2925
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
As far as instance capacity goes

2926
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Okay

2927
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Um

2928
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
We also

2929
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Uh

2930
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Prepared to increase that

2931
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
As well

2932
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Like in terms of just like

2933
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Talking to cloud vendors

2934
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And stuff like that

2935
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:49,000
About like you know

2936
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
What if we go over this

2937
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Like do we have a plan

2938
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
For how we're gonna scale up

2939
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Like that kind of stuff

2940
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
So a million is the capacity

2941
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
That we'll have on day one

2942
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Uh

2943
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Like before we know

2944
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
How many people we're gonna get

2945
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Um

2946
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And my hope is that that'll be enough

2947
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Cool

2948
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I'm pretty sure that that

2949
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I'm pretty sure we'll get it

2950
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
In a million

2951
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I don't think it's gonna go

2952
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I think the chance of going above

2953
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
A million is pretty low honestly

2954
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Um

2955
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
But uh

2956
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
You never know

2957
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Um

2958
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Uh

2959
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
You never know

2960
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Yeah

2961
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
You never know

2962
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I think as I said

2963
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I think the chance to go

2964
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Above that is pretty low

2965
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Um

2966
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Just because bear in mind

2967
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
It is paid right

2968
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It's not like

2969
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Yeah

2970
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Like okay

2971
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Let me say this

2972
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
On our full release

2973
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
When it's free

2974
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Like I think the numbers

2975
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Will be much higher than a million

2976
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I think that's gonna be

2977
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Very very high

2978
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Um

2979
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Like absurdly high

2980
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Um

2981
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
But uh

2982
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,000
For a paid

2983
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Uh

2984
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Early access

2985
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I think getting to a million

2986
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Would be a very good success

2987
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Um

2988
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Uh

2989
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Like that would be

2990
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
That would be crazy

2991
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Um

2992
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
But yet I think that we might be

2993
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
On the way to it

2994
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,000
For sure

2995
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Um

2996
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
And uh

2997
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Yeah

2998
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
As I said

2999
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Million is what we're

3000
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Because of the fact

3001
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,000
That we're like

3002
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
We want to make sure

3003
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:46,000
We don't screw this up

3004
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
A million is what we're getting

3005
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
For instance capacity

3006
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:50,000
When I say instance

3007
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
By the way

3008
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I'm talking about

3009
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
The actual servers

3010
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
That individual players play on

3011
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
As opposed to like

3012
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
The back end

3013
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Which is like

3014
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Where all the

3015
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Um

3016
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
You know

3017
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Which is the

3018
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
The scaling challenge

3019
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,000
That's much more

3020
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Hard to know

3021
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Cool

3022
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Now as far as like

3023
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Testing

3024
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Uh

3025
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Like

3026
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Like testing the back end

3027
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And making sure it can work

3028
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
The hard part there

3029
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Is like

3030
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Can you simulate

3031
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Player numbers

3032
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Uh

3033
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Like

3034
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Correctly enough

3035
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
To actually know

3036
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
What's going on

3037
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
So we've got

3038
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
A synthetic test

3039
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:17,000
That goes up to

3040
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
1.6

3041
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
1.6 million

3042
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
In the back end

3043
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Before it falls over

3044
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Um

3045
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And we want to try

3046
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And improve that

3047
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
To 2 million

3048
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Before we launch

3049
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Just so that we

3050
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Like can be like

3051
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Okay

3052
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
But the thing is

3053
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Is that

3054
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
That's a synthetic test

3055
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Right

3056
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Like we don't

3057
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Like we write a bot

3058
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
That simulates

3059
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
What a player does

3060
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:31,000
But like

3061
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:31,000
What if we're just

3062
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Wrong about that

3063
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
And like people

3064
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,000
You know

3065
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And there's all sorts

3066
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Of numbers

3067
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
That you can play around

3068
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:35,000
With like

3069
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:35,000
How often do people

3070
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Change areas

3071
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And how often do people

3072
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Like how many items

3073
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Do people pick up

3074
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
We don't really know

3075
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
The numbers for that

3076
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Yeah

3077
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
We can look at

3078
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,000
PWE1

3079
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And we can kind of

3080
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Assume that they're similar

3081
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
And we can try and

3082
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Kind of like get things

3083
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
To like some kind of

3084
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Real world situation

3085
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
But then it'll just be

3086
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Some other random thing

3087
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
We don't even think about

3088
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
That like players

3089
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:51,000
End up doing

3090
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
That we just don't even

3091
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
That that can cause the issue

3092
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
So um

3093
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Uh

3094
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
The other thing as well

3095
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Is like

3096
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
What if we just

3097
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Didn't like

3098
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Okay so sure

3099
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
We wrote it to

3100
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
To that many players

3101
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Like as a test

3102
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
But uh

3103
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
There could be like

3104
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Even more subtle elements

3105
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Like

3106
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Here's a random example

3107
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
We did think about

3108
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
But like um

3109
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Just to sort of

3110
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Give you an example

3111
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Of the kind of subtlety

3112
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,000
That happens here

3113
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
So um

3114
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
We have processes

3115
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,000
In the backend

3116
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Called instance managers

3117
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Which like deal with

3118
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Um

3119
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Uh

3120
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Uh

3121
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Like effectively

3122
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
They just like know

3123
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Where all the instances

3124
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Are

3125
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Like all the game instances

3126
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Are

3127
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And like if they

3128
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Fall over

3129
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,000
You know like

3130
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,000
If they

3131
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
They're keeping track

3132
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Of them effectively

3133
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
And um

3134
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
The uh

3135
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
We've got more than

3136
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,000
One of these

3137
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
But like

3138
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
To know which one

3139
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
To contact

3140
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,000
You need to know

3141
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Like you need to have

3142
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Something to work out

3143
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Like what

3144
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
What is the thing

3145
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,000
That like

3146
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
That will tell you

3147
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Like which instance manager

3148
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I should be talking to

3149
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Whenever I'm going to

3150
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Go to a new area

3151
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And so we shard this

3152
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Based on the

3153
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Um

3154
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
The area

3155
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Um

3156
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Yeah

3157
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
The area index

3158
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And the thing that we

3159
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Realized uh

3160
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Recently was that like

3161
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
When everyone plays

3162
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The game

3163
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Initially

3164
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
They're all going to be

3165
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,000
In the same area

3166
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
They're all going to be

3167
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Starting in uh

3168
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
In what's called

3169
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,000
G11

3170
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Which is like

3171
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:05,000
The first area of the game

3172
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And then

3173
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
A bunch of those people

3174
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Like there'll be a very

3175
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Similar amount of time

3176
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
That people will take

3177
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
To get from there

3178
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:11,000
To the next area

3179
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Yeah

3180
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And so that means

3181
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:13,000
That everyone will go

3182
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:13,000
From there to like

3183
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
The next area

3184
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:14,000
And so that means like

3185
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
All the load's going to be

3186
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
On one of these

3187
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Instance managers

3188
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And then all the load's

3189
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Going to move to a

3190
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Different instance manager

3191
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,000
If it's all going to

3192
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Happen at the same time

3193
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Which means there's

3194
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Actually like

3195
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
The thing with having

3196
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
More of these

3197
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Is like completely defeated

3198
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
By just the way

3199
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:25,000
That that will happen

3200
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
On launch

3201
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And like that's not

3202
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Something that our load

3203
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Test would immediately

3204
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Notice because like

3205
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
We kind of have to think

3206
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
About how the actual

3207
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Players will actually

3208
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Be behaving on release

3209
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Day to be able to

3210
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
See that kind of issue

3211
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
So like that's what

3212
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
We did think of

3213
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
But like there could be

3214
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
200 other things like

3215
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:39,000
That that we didn't

3216
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Think of that like

3217
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
You know could result

3218
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,000
In problems and so

3219
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
This is the kind of

3220
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Stuff that like you

3221
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Know as I said that

3222
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
You just never expect

3223
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
In the back end so

3224
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
This is probably like

3225
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Way too much detail

3226
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And like I'm being

3227
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Way too general here

3228
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I love the transparency

3229
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It's really great

3230
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,000
But okay but anyway

3231
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
That's the kind of issue

3232
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
So I'm hoping that

3233
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Whatever it is

3234
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Is like really obvious

3235
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Like whatever problem

3236
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,000
We do run into

3237
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Is like really obvious

3238
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
To us so we can

3239
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Just fix it

3240
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
But it's because

3241
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
The part that really

3242
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Sucks is like

3243
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
The thing fell over

3244
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Like there's no crash

3245
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
There's no like thing

3246
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
It's just a bunch of

3247
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,000
People got disconnected

3248
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
There's no logs

3249
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
There's nothing for us

3250
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,000
To even latch onto

3251
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
And that's like the

3252
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Really horrible type of

3253
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Issue that I really

3254
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Hope we don't run into

3255
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
But yeah

3256
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
You know I

3257
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You never know

3258
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
We'll see what happens

3259
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I'm hoping it will be okay

3260
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah I mean to be free

3261
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:24,000
You could just do

3262
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
A surprise launch

3263
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Right now

3264
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Then there will be

3265
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Like no one's expecting it

3266
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And just

3267
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Well there would be

3268
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Somehow I don't think

3269
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
That's a good idea

3270
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So I guess what will be

3271
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Really interesting to see

3272
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Is how big do the queues get

3273
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
On

3274
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Like I

3275
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Yeah

3276
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
That could be scary

3277
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Yeah

3278
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
But I think it'll be okay

3279
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I think it'll be okay

3280
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I'm excited

3281
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I'm very hyped

3282
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Awesome

3283
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Thank you so much

3284
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
For the transparency there

3285
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
That was more in depth

3286
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Than I was expecting

3287
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And yeah

3288
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Love it

3289
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
A question about

3290
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,000
ExileCon

3291
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Are there going to be

3292
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
More ExileCons

3293
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Will there be one

3294
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Before or after release

3295
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Like what's the vibe there

3296
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
So we were actually

3297
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Originally planning to have

3298
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,000
One next year

3299
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
And

3300
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
As it got closer

3301
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
We were just like

3302
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Man

3303
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Do we really want to

3304
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Are we really

3305
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Really wanting to

3306
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Be having to deal

3307
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
With another ExileCon

3308
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
This close

3309
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Like it's

3310
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Like you know

3311
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:21,000
We're pretty tired

3312
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It's a lot of work

3313
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I don't know if I can actually

3314
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
It's a lot of work

3315
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And it is like a huge amount of work

3316
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So we're kind of like

3317
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,000
You know what

3318
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
We're not going to do one in 2025

3319
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So we'll think about the year after that

3320
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
But

3321
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
We

3322
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:32,000
As I said

3323
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
We actually originally

3324
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Had made a booking and everything

3325
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Of like the venue

3326
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And we were like

3327
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:36,000
We were actually keen

3328
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
But then

3329
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
When we really looked at it

3330
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,000
We were like

3331
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I worry that we're going to be

3332
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Like close to

3333
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Like to

3334
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Like if we're like

3335
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Really close to the release

3336
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
At that point

3337
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
When that would have been scheduled

3338
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
That could just like

3339
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Just be really

3340
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Like too much load

3341
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
On our studio

3342
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:51,000
All at one time

3343
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Because running an ExileCon

3344
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Really is like

3345
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
It is a crazy amount of work

3346
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,000
For the whole studio

3347
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Like it's just a huge amount

3348
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Of stuff

3349
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,000
So

3350
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Look

3351
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I am almost certain

3352
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,000
We'll have another one

3353
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I just don't think

3354
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
We're going to have

3355
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
We're just not going to have one next year

3356
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Just because it's

3357
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
It's going to be too much

3358
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Going on I think

3359
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
For our studio

3360
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Because you know

3361
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
It's really fun to run them

3362
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Like

3363
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Like

3364
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Even though it's all that work

3365
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Like it is really fun to run them

3366
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
And like having all the community

3367
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Like it's a huge

3368
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It's a really fun thing

3369
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,000
And like

3370
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
If we had infinite resources

3371
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Then having ExileCon

3372
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Right before the full release

3373
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Would be like

3374
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
The most amazing

3375
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Marketing opportunity

3376
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Right

3377
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Like that would be great

3378
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
But then the idea

3379
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Of having to do all of that

3380
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And also get the release out

3381
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
At the same time

3382
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's just like

3383
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
It's just too much

3384
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I just don't think

3385
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
We'd be able to do it

3386
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
That makes sense

3387
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Makes sense

3388
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
It's a lot of work

3389
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Question again

3390
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
About bosses

3391
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Is every single boss

3392
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Going to be

3393
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
You die once

3394
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And it's over

3395
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Like you know

3396
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
You collect 300

3397
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Zesh Duelas

3398
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Blinters or whatever

3399
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Right right

3400
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
So we had

3401
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
We've actually had

3402
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Quite a lot of conversations

3403
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
About this topic

3404
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
With the 300 splinters

3405
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Thing just to

3406
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
By the way

3407
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,000
It's like

3408
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
They do come in stacks

3409
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
So it's not like

3410
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
You have to fight

3411
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
300 breaches to do that

3412
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,000
But

3413
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
This was definitely

3414
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,000
A question

3415
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Should we allow

3416
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,000
More portals

3417
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
For some of these bosses

3418
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Because like

3419
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
You know

3420
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,000
It's like the first time

3421
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
That you save up

3422
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
The first time

3423
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,000
You're going to fight it

3424
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And then you just

3425
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Die instantly to some ability

3426
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And like

3427
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Is that okay

3428
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And

3429
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
There were definitely

3430
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Some arguments about this

3431
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
But we eventually

3432
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Decided that

3433
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Yeah

3434
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
We are going to leave it

3435
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,000
As one death

3436
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
For those bosses

3437
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Just because

3438
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
We just want to make sure

3439
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
That there's integrity

3440
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
In the

3441
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
You know

3442
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Like in the boss fight

3443
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:22,000
That you actually

3444
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Like did actually

3445
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Have to kill it

3446
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
From top to bottom

3447
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
It is one of those things

3448
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Though that like

3449
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,000
If

3450
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It really was a problem

3451
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I guess we could

3452
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Readdress it

3453
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
But like

3454
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I think we're pretty keen

3455
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
To go with just one death

3456
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Even for those

3457
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
For the time being

3458
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Cool

3459
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
But yes

3460
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Yeah

3461
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Very interesting

3462
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,000
There was a lot of

3463
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Argument about it for sure

3464
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Yeah I mean

3465
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Obviously like

3466
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I'm going to be

3467
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Hardcore hopefully

3468
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Most of the time

3469
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Once I figure the game out

3470
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So I was just

3471
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Mostly asking for

3472
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Softcore players

3473
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I'll be very curious

3474
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
How they feel about it

3475
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Cool

3476
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Okay another question

3477
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
How do you feel

3478
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
About safe mechanics

3479
01:25:59,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Like Toda

3480
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Like obviously

3481
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
RuneScape is probably

3482
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
The game that comes to mind

3483
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Where you can

3484
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Very very much

3485
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
More than any game

3486
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I can think of

3487
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Tailor

3488
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Exactly what type of content

3489
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
You want to be doing

3490
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Right

3491
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Like

3492
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
If you want to

3493
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You can do completely

3494
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Safe content

3495
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Or you can focus

3496
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
On like a really hard

3497
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Boss fight

3498
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Where it takes

3499
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
All of your focus

3500
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So yeah

3501
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
What are your thoughts

3502
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
On like being able

3503
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
To tailor your custom content

3504
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
So I mean

3505
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I would say that

3506
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
PoE is pretty strong

3507
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
In this regard as well

3508
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Right

3509
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Like you've got the ability

3510
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
To change the degree

3511
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
To which like

3512
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,000
How many mods

3513
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You put on maps

3514
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
And then like

3515
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:31,000
How much you're juicing

3516
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Things with mechanics

3517
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
For the towers

3518
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
And all sorts of stuff

3519
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Like that

3520
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
So I would say

3521
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
That PoE is one of the games

3522
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Where you do actually

3523
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Have quite a lot of control

3524
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
So like you can definitely

3525
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Get like look

3526
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
If you're running a white map

3527
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
There's not a huge amount

3528
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:43,000
That's just going to

3529
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Randomly kill you

3530
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
If you're like

3531
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
If you're powerful enough

3532
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:47,000
To deal with that

3533
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You should be okay

3534
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
It really is the other

3535
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Like the other extra difficulty

3536
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
You add

3537
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
That makes it so that

3538
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You're

3539
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
So that you're more

3540
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
That you're more safe

3541
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And like especially now

3542
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
That the bosses

3543
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Have been moved out

3544
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Of the regular map

3545
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So that you've

3546
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Like you can choose

3547
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Whether you're doing them

3548
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Or not

3549
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Like you have

3550
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Even that choice as well

3551
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,000
So yeah

3552
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
I'm a fan of

3553
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Tailoring content difficulty

3554
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
And that is the goal

3555
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
For us as well

3556
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Right

3557
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Just like make sure

3558
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
That you can

3559
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:10,000
You can decide that

3560
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Awesome

3561
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Yeah

3562
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
No me too

3563
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I'm a big fan of that

3564
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Very cool

3565
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So talking about

3566
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Playing hardcore

3567
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And pausing and stuff

3568
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
So let's say that

3569
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I've opened an expensive

3570
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Boss fight

3571
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It took me a while to farm

3572
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And I'm halfway

3573
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Through the fight

3574
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And I'm like

3575
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Oh this is not going well

3576
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
This is not going down well

3577
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
But I don't want to leave either

3578
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Can I pause the fight

3579
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And be like

3580
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Steel mage

3581
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I need help

3582
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Right now

3583
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Please come get me

3584
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And can he then like

3585
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,000
While

3586
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
While I'm paused

3587
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Can you come help me

3588
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
So

3589
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I

3590
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Okay so

3591
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Currently

3592
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
You actually can't

3593
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Like do things

3594
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Like accept invites

3595
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And everything

3596
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
While you're paused

3597
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Now we actually had planned

3598
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
We actually had planned

3599
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,000
To allow you to do

3600
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Way more stuff while paused

3601
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
There was this whole

3602
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Pause rework we were going to do

3603
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,000
We were going to change the interface

3604
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
You can pause the game

3605
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And still be able to like

3606
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Look at the rest of the interface

3607
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And like kind of

3608
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Do certain things

3609
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:05,000
While paused or not

3610
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And then we could just

3611
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Make the decision of like

3612
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
What's allowed when paused

3613
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,000
And what isn't

3614
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Yeah

3615
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
But we never got it

3616
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,000
We unfortunately didn't get time

3617
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
To do it

3618
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
So right now

3619
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
The

3620
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
You wouldn't be able to

3621
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Accept a challenge while paused

3622
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
But that being said

3623
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
You could like pause the game

3624
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Message your friend

3625
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
He sends you an invite

3626
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
You unpause quickly

3627
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Click accept

3628
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And then pause again

3629
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Right like it is kind of possible

3630
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Right

3631
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And so there's kind of

3632
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Really no reason to like

3633
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Not allow you to accept

3634
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
An invite while paused

3635
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,000
For that reason

3636
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Because like you can

3637
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Just kind of do that

3638
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
So like that would be possible

3639
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Cool

3640
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And ultimately

3641
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
That would mean

3642
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
That you can kind of do that

3643
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
The question then is like

3644
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Can you get to the person

3645
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
In a fight

3646
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
And that depends on the context

3647
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Yeah

3648
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Now I don't actually know

3649
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
100% of all the rules

3650
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,000
About this

3651
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
About exactly what goes on

3652
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I believe that when you

3653
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Seeshell to someone

3654
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
As the players call it

3655
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
That it's

3656
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,000
The

3657
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
That you go to the

3658
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Checkpoint of the last

3659
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Like you go to the

3660
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Physical location of the

3661
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Most recent checkpoint

3662
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
The player has

3663
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Yeah

3664
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And then from there

3665
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
You can go into the boss fight

3666
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:02,000
So during campaign

3667
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
You can certainly

3668
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Just like get into

3669
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Someone's boss fight

3670
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Very easily

3671
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Yeah

3672
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
What I don't know is

3673
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Is what the situation is

3674
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
With regard to maps

3675
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
And exactly how that works

3676
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
So I would have to check on that

3677
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
To work out exactly

3678
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
What you could do there

3679
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Yeah

3680
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I am sure there's going to be

3681
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
All sorts of like exploits

3682
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
And like random issues

3683
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Around pausing

3684
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
And checkpoints as well

3685
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:23,000
And like all of those things

3686
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Like I just have a feeling

3687
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
That there's going to be

3688
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Stuff like we obviously

3689
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Do our best to think of these

3690
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But I'm sure there's going to be

3691
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Some stuff

3692
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:28,000
So there might have to be

3693
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Some tweaks to the rules

3694
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Later on here

3695
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
But as far as I know

3696
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
You can do that

3697
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Like I believe

3698
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
So I'm pretty sure

3699
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,000
What should happen

3700
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Is I think that for maps

3701
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,000
The last checkpoint

3702
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Is like still in the map room

3703
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah

3704
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Because there's no checkpoints

3705
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,000
In maps

3706
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
So I'm pretty sure

3707
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:44,000
What would happen is

3708
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Is they'd go outside the map

3709
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
They would be standing

3710
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Where the portals are

3711
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And if there's a portal available

3712
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,000
They'll be able to go

3713
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Through that portal

3714
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And so if you moved the portal

3715
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Close to the boss fight

3716
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Before you went into it

3717
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Because you can't use the portal

3718
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
While in the boss fight

3719
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Then that would mean

3720
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
They'd be outside the boss fight

3721
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
And so long as there's a way

3722
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
To get into the boss fight

3723
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:58,000
After the fact

3724
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
It should work

3725
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
So as far as I know

3726
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
That should be how it works

3727
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
At the moment

3728
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
But as I said

3729
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
There might be individual rules

3730
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,000
That we can add

3731
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Or remove or whatever

3732
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Like there'll probably be

3733
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Tweaks to this I'm sure

3734
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Cool

3735
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Also chat really wants me

3736
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
To correct you

3737
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And say we call it swirly

3738
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
What?

3739
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Okay

3740
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:13,000
For some reason

3741
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
People around here

3742
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Call them seashells

3743
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Seashelling

3744
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Right

3745
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I don't know where that

3746
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Maybe that's just

3747
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
In GGG slang for this

3748
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:20,000
That's funny

3749
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Yeah I mean

3750
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Apparently it looks like a seashell

3751
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
That is really cool

3752
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Though I'm obviously

3753
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:26,000
A little bit biased

3754
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Like I would love to run

3755
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Like a boss service

3756
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Where I'm like

3757
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Coming to rescue people

3758
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So

3759
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
That'd be very fun

3760
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Well as far as I know

3761
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
That should be possible

3762
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Right now

3763
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
But as I said

3764
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
We might tweak the rules

3765
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Cool

3766
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
A little bit of like

3767
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
A more random cutesy question

3768
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
With

3769
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
How do you feel about

3770
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Like mini games

3771
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Like fishing

3772
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Or just like

3773
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Things to do that

3774
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Aren't necessarily

3775
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Like the core game

3776
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I don't know

3777
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Like

3778
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Some people find that stuff fun

3779
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Maybe

3780
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I mean I guess

3781
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I see the mini games

3782
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,000
In POE

3783
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
As more like

3784
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
The different league mechanics

3785
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
So you know

3786
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Like

3787
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Those are the things

3788
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,000
That we're probably

3789
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
More likely to add

3790
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
But you know

3791
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I know people have been

3792
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Wanting a fishing mini game

3793
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
For a long time

3794
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I guess

3795
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Look we have boat support now

3796
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Right

3797
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I know

3798
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Like from the hideout

3799
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
So you know

3800
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,000
You never know I guess

3801
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Cool

3802
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Two factor authentication

3803
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Is that something

3804
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
We can see improvements of

3805
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
In POE too

3806
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
So

3807
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
This is one of those things

3808
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Where like

3809
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
It's trivially easy

3810
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
To add two factor authentication

3811
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
The hard part is

3812
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
All the support policy

3813
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Around

3814
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
What happens when people

3815
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Lose their second factor

3816
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And

3817
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
It's like

3818
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Like

3819
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Okay

3820
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,000
So like

3821
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
How do you verify someone

3822
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Who's lost their second factor

3823
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And then like

3824
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,000
That's a whole thing

3825
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
That's all

3826
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Drama around this

3827
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,000
And then like

3828
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
You open yourself up

3829
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,000
To like

3830
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
All sorts of like

3831
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Support mistakes

3832
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
You could be making

3833
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
With that kind of stuff

3834
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:50,000
And like

3835
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
It's notoriously

3836
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,000
That you have

3837
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
So this thing

3838
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,000
And then people say

3839
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Oh

3840
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
You should just tell people

3841
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
That if they had two factor

3842
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Then if they had the second factor

3843
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,000
They're just

3844
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
They're just hosed

3845
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And it's like

3846
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Well you can say that now

3847
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
You say that right up

3848
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,000
To the point

3849
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
You do lose your second factor

3850
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
And then you're like

3851
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Why is there no recovery process

3852
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:03,000
For this

3853
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:03,000
You know what I mean

3854
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Like

3855
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
There has to be a recovery process

3856
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
And then

3857
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
It's like

3858
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Okay

3859
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So then how do we verify it

3860
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So then people are like

3861
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Oh you know

3862
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:09,000
You could like

3863
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Take government ID

3864
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And it's like

3865
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Okay well now there's like

3866
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
GDPR and privacy implications

3867
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Of this

3868
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
And it's like

3869
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's just kind of

3870
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
An endless rabbit hole

3871
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Of like

3872
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Random policy

3873
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
And horrible stuff

3874
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
And so

3875
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Like

3876
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
We should have it right

3877
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Like absolutely

3878
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
We should 100%

3879
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
We should have two factor

3880
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
We just don't

3881
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
And it's all because of that

3882
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Like the tricky stuff

3883
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Around this

3884
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And like one day

3885
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I just have no doubt

3886
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
We will implement this

3887
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
But

3888
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Yeah

3889
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:32,000
It's just

3890
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
We just need to dig ourselves

3891
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Out of the hole

3892
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Of all the policy issues

3893
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Around support for this

3894
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
That's the thing

3895
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And so

3896
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
What I will say though

3897
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Is just as a thing

3898
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Is that you can

3899
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Effectively outsource

3900
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
The two factor

3901
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,000
On your account

3902
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
By using Steam

3903
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
If you want

3904
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Because they have two factor

3905
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
And if Steam

3906
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Is the only

3907
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Login method

3908
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,000
On your account

3909
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Then effectively

3910
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You're just relying

3911
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
On their two factors

3912
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,000
To be able to

3913
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
To work

3914
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:52,000
So you still have

3915
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
That option at least

3916
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
But yeah

3917
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,000
We should add two factors

3918
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
To the regular login system

3919
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
And I want to add two factors

3920
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
To the regular login system

3921
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It's just a question

3922
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Of getting time

3923
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,000
To sort through

3924
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
All the problems with it

3925
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Speaking of

3926
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Regular login system

3927
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I can't remember

3928
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
If this was already confirmed

3929
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
But do we still have

3930
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Both the standalone client

3931
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And Steam?

3932
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Yep

3933
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Okay

3934
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Excellent

3935
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Excellent

3936
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Another community question

3937
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
So there is a limit

3938
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Of support gems

3939
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Right?

3940
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I can only use

3941
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Element control destruction

3942
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
On one gem

3943
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I can't use it on two gems

3944
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Correct

3945
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Is that rule still the same

3946
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
On my weapon swap?

3947
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Let's say that I have

3948
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
A lightning ability

3949
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
In one weapon swap

3950
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
And a cold ability

3951
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
In the other

3952
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
But on both of these

3953
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Main gems

3954
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I want to use

3955
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Control destruction

3956
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
So the

3957
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
There's one per character

3958
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
It doesn't relate

3959
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:40,000
To weapon swap

3960
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Because the thing

3961
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,000
That I just want to

3962
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Clarify around this

3963
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Is that like

3964
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:43,000
It's not like

3965
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
You've got slots

3966
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
That are just like

3967
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
One versus the other

3968
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Right?

3969
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Like when you look

3970
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
At your skill screen

3971
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:48,000
They're all just

3972
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
On one screen

3973
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
That you just get

3974
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
To enable or disable

3975
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Certain skills

3976
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
For being used

3977
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:53,000
By a certain weapon swap

3978
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
So there's no like

3979
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Like yeah

3980
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
As far as the question goes

3981
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Like yeah

3982
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Like it is one

3983
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
For the entire character

3984
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
When we saw

3985
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Like videos

3986
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Somebody had a video

3987
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Going through the settings

3988
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And stuff like that

3989
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
And I did not see

3990
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Lockstep or predictive

3991
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Being there

3992
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Is that still a thing?

3993
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Why wouldn't it have

3994
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Been there?

3995
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
It should have been there

3996
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Okay so

3997
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Apparently it's only

3998
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:29,000
In the menu screen

3999
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah

4000
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Because you can't

4001
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Change it while you're

4002
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
In game

4003
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
But yeah

4004
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It should be there

4005
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
As far as I know

4006
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
One thing I will say

4007
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Is that predictive

4008
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
With WSD

4009
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Sorry not

4010
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Predictive

4011
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Okay let me get this right

4012
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Okay so

4013
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
There is a mode

4014
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Called hybrid

4015
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
And I think

4016
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
That with WSD

4017
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Predictive turns

4018
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Into hybrid

4019
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
But I'm not sure

4020
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Whether or not

4021
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,000
They've actually

4022
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Fiddled around

4023
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,000
With the interface

4024
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Of this

4025
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Hybrid is the mode

4026
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
That consoles use

4027
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
But I don't think

4028
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It tells you about it

4029
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Because I don't think

4030
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
There's a setting

4031
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
For it in consoles

4032
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,000
But effectively

4033
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
What that is

4034
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
It's somewhere in between

4035
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Predictive and lockstep

4036
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I guess I could

4037
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And effectively

4038
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
What it is

4039
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Is that

4040
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
This is kind of irrelevant

4041
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,000
But

4042
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Effectively

4043
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
With lockstep

4044
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
When there's lag

4045
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Internet lag

4046
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
The whole game freezes

4047
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
And with predictive

4048
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
When there's internet

4049
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Lag

4050
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:27,000
The game does not

4051
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Freeze

4052
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Hybrid is a mode

4053
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Where we still

4054
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Use predictive

4055
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Networking

4056
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
But we still

4057
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Freeze everything

4058
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
When the server

4059
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Hasn't replied to you

4060
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And that's just

4061
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Because it keeps

4062
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Everything sync

4063
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
A little bit better

4064
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
But prevents

4065
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
And prevents some

4066
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Of the issues

4067
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,000
That you get in predictive

4068
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
And that mode

4069
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Just works a bit better

4070
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,000
When you're using

4071
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Direct control

4072
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
WSD

4073
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
And stuff

4074
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Without causing

4075
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Too many

4076
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Desync issues

4077
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
So that's just

4078
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
A random detail there

4079
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,000
But yeah

4080
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
As far as I know

4081
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:53,000
They still work

4082
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
And they should be

4083
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Fine

4084
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
What I worry about

4085
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
And this is just

4086
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Random speculation

4087
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:01,000
On my part

4088
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Is that like

4089
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Pretty much everyone

4090
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
In GGG plays in lockstep

4091
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Yeah

4092
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
And so what that means

4093
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Is that like

4094
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I worry that there won't

4095
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Be as much testing

4096
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:10,000
In predictive

4097
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
And there could be like

4098
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Issues that happen

4099
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,000
In predictive

4100
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
That we're just not aware of

4101
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Because of the fact

4102
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
That like everyone's

4103
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Just playing in lockstep

4104
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,000
All the time

4105
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So it probably

4106
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Hasn't received

4107
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
The same testing

4108
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
As what lockstep gets

4109
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
So I would suggest

4110
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
To you

4111
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,000
You play in lockstep

4112
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
If you can

4113
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Obviously the issue

4114
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Is when your latency

4115
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Is high

4116
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
But yeah

4117
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
That's the sort of stuff

4118
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
That I'm sure

4119
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,000
We'll get more testing

4120
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
As we go into early access

4121
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
As well

4122
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
But yeah

4123
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Just a random thing

4124
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
A question I just thought of

4125
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Was in Peewee 1

4126
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
A thing that can happen

4127
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Is

4128
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Assets loading

4129
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And being invisible

4130
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
If they were already

4131
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Loading ones

4132
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Is that a fixed thing

4133
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:46,000
In Peewee 2

4134
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Unfortunately

4135
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
That's not fixed

4136
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
And this is something

4137
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,000
That really really

4138
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Bothers me

4139
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
But look

4140
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,000
It's something that

4141
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,000
We're going to be

4142
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Like we

4143
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
We do

4144
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
We

4145
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I really want to fix that

4146
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,000
I really

4147
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Really want to fix it

4148
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Like it's

4149
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,000
It's the worst thing

4150
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
To me

4151
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Is that

4152
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Is that occurring

4153
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So we'll get to the point

4154
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Where that can occur

4155
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
It's actually been made

4156
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Harder in Peewee 2

4157
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Because of the fact

4158
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
The assets are larger

4159
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,000
In general

4160
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,000
You know

4161
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Like higher resolution

4162
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Textures

4163
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:09,000
And higher resolution

4164
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Like models

4165
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
And stuff like that

4166
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
So I don't think

4167
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:13,000
It will necessarily

4168
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Be worse or anything

4169
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
But yeah

4170
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
It sucks

4171
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
It really sucks to me

4172
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Whenever a thing

4173
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Doesn't load

4174
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
And so

4175
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
This is a thing

4176
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
That we will be working on

4177
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And improving

4178
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Over time

4179
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I want to get to the point

4180
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Where it's just 100%

4181
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:26,000
The case

4182
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
That you never see

4183
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
An asset pop

4184
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Like that

4185
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
That would be ideal

4186
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Awesome

4187
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Yeah

4188
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
But we'll work

4189
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Towards that

4190
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
But we aren't there yet

4191
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Cool

4192
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
A lot of people

4193
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Are asking about

4194
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Pre-download

4195
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Being

4196
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Especially for people

4197
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
With slow connections

4198
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Being able to

4199
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Start downloading

4200
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
The files

4201
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Before the 6th

4202
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:52,000
So the concern

4203
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
There

4204
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Is

4205
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Would be

4206
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,000
What do you call it

4207
01:37:59,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Data mining

4208
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Yeah

4209
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Yeah

4210
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,000
That's the concern

4211
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
With that

4212
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
My question is

4213
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Pre-download

4214
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Slash data mining

4215
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Yeah

4216
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Yeah

4217
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I'll

4218
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Like

4219
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,000
We're

4220
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Definitely more

4221
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Vulnerable to data mining

4222
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
For POE 2

4223
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Than we are in POE 1

4224
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Usually

4225
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Just because

4226
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
You know

4227
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Like there's so much

4228
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,000
More new stuff

4229
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Like just

4230
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
The whole campaign

4231
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Being something

4232
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
People haven't played

4233
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Yeah

4234
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
You know

4235
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So like

4236
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:23,000
It's

4237
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
That

4238
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,000
That

4239
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
That would be the concern

4240
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I guess

4241
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I do understand

4242
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Why you'd want this though

4243
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
So

4244
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I'll

4245
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I guess I'll just have to

4246
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Talk to

4247
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I guess I just have to talk

4248
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,000
And see how we feel about it

4249
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Like yeah

4250
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
The concern is data mining though

4251
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:39,000
That would be the reason

4252
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Not to do it

4253
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
So

4254
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Yeah

4255
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Yeah

4256
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
That would be

4257
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,000
That

4258
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
That

4259
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,000
That

4260
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
That's really the issue

4261
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Yeah

4262
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I'm a big fan of

4263
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Like that

4264
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
That it hasn't been

4265
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Datamined yet

4266
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:52,000
At least

4267
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I love that

4268
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Right

4269
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Right

4270
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Right

4271
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
It will be interesting

4272
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
To see how fast

4273
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
The data mining occurs

4274
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Like

4275
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Obviously

4276
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:58,000
When you've got a thing

4277
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Like this

4278
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Like a lot of people

4279
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Now

4280
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
We do have some stuff

4281
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:02,000
To improve

4282
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
The

4283
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Like

4284
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Certain

4285
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Certain things

4286
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Will be harder to data mine

4287
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Than they were in the past

4288
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
But on the other hand

4289
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:09,000
There are some things

4290
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
The client just has to have

4291
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,000
And if the client has to have it

4292
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Then there's just no way

4293
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
To prevent data mining of it

4294
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Because like

4295
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:14,000
You know

4296
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
It has to be on the client

4297
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
For the client

4298
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
To be able to see

4299
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
A mod on the client

4300
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
The client has to have

4301
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
The text of the mod

4302
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Right

4303
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Yeah

4304
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
So on some level

4305
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
You've got to have that stuff

4306
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
So yeah

4307
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Cool

4308
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Makes sense

4309
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Is rarity multiplicative

4310
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Or additive

4311
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:30,000
With a map

4312
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Slash monster rarity

4313
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I

4314
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:35,000
You mean

4315
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
So player rarity

4316
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Yeah

4317
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Player rarity is multiplicative

4318
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
With the map rarity

4319
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Yeah

4320
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
So that's still the case

4321
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Right

4322
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Yeah

4323
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
A question about

4324
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
What like

4325
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
What leagues are

4326
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Because obviously

4327
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
We are still going to have

4328
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Leagues in PeeWee 2

4329
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
What are they going to be

4330
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Based around

4331
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Right now

4332
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
They're being inspired

4333
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
By other games

4334
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Is that still going to be

4335
01:39:59,000 --> 01:39:59,000
The case

4336
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Oh I mean

4337
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:01,000
That's always the case

4338
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Right

4339
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:02,000
We're always looking

4340
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
At other mechanics

4341
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,000
I mean ultimately

4342
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
It comes down to

4343
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:04,000
What is cool

4344
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
And so that means

4345
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
That all we're really doing

4346
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
When we're looking

4347
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
At other games

4348
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Is like

4349
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Is there something

4350
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
We can notice here

4351
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
That could inspire us

4352
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,000
To be cool

4353
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,000
But like

4354
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
It doesn't have to be

4355
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Another game

4356
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
It could be a movie

4357
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Or like

4358
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Some random other thing

4359
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Like you never know

4360
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Where the inspiration

4361
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Is going to come from

4362
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
But yeah

4363
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
That stuff can definitely

4364
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Happen

4365
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Just you know

4366
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Can we come up

4367
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
With a cool mechanic

4368
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:23,000
That's all it comes down to

4369
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Yeah

4370
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Is there any game

4371
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Off the top of your head

4372
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:27,000
That you're like

4373
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Oh

4374
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Do we really like

4375
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Want to find a way

4376
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
To like get this in PeeWee

4377
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:31,000
That like inspires you

4378
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I don't know

4379
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:34,000
That I can name one

4380
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Right now

4381
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:35,000
If we

4382
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Like it's like

4383
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Anything that would

4384
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Have happened like that

4385
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
We probably already

4386
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Made a leak for it

4387
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Yeah

4388
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,000
So it would have to

4389
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Be something recent

4390
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
And we haven't been

4391
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Talking about leagues

4392
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
In PeeWee 2 yet

4393
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:43,000
So we haven't had

4394
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Like a brainstorming session

4395
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
About that yet

4396
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Yeah

4397
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:47,000
So yeah

4398
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I don't think

4399
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I can come up

4400
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
With one at the moment

4401
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Awesome

4402
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
And

4403
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
That's pretty much

4404
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
The final question here

4405
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I kind of tried

4406
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
To avoid open-ended questions

4407
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
But

4408
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Is there any

4409
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Particularly large

4410
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Engine changes

4411
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
With PeeWee 2

4412
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,000
That allows you

4413
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
To do something

4414
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:02,000
That you've always

4415
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Wanted to do in PeeWee 1

4416
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
But you weren't able to

4417
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
So most of the changes

4418
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Like engine wise

4419
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Have actually

4420
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Are actually on

4421
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
PeeWee 1's engine

4422
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Because we wanted to

4423
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Merge them so that

4424
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
We can make all the

4425
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Assets transfer

4426
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Yeah

4427
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Probably one of the

4428
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Largest changes

4429
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
That is different

4430
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Between PeeWee 1 and 2

4431
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Is the global

4432
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Elimination system

4433
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
And

4434
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
What that kind of

4435
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Means is that

4436
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
So like

4437
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Any

4438
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
And this was

4439
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Like we had

4440
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
G.I. in PeeWee 1 as well

4441
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,000
But it kind of

4442
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Works differently

4443
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
So like

4444
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Effectively

4445
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
The nice thing

4446
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
That you can do

4447
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
With a really good G.I.

4448
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Is that you can

4449
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Light objects

4450
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Without having to

4451
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Actually place lights

4452
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:39,000
In them

4453
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Like they just get lit

4454
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
By the glowing parts

4455
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:41,000
And so you just get

4456
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
A really nice

4457
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Like soft form of

4458
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Lighting from certain

4459
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Things

4460
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:44,000
And

4461
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Certain areas

4462
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Can actually be lit

4463
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Entirely with

4464
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
The G.I. system

4465
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Which is just really nice

4466
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Like you get the ability

4467
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
To do some lighting

4468
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
That's just really

4469
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Quite different than

4470
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
What PeeWee 1

4471
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Has been capable of

4472
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
So yeah

4473
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Like that's pretty cool

4474
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I'm trying to think

4475
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,000
If there's anything else

4476
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
That like we didn't

4477
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Actually port over

4478
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:02,000
But not really

4479
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Like because we've

4480
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Tried to get everything

4481
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
As much as possible

4482
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
To be the same

4483
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Just for asset portability

4484
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
So

4485
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Oh there's quite a lot

4486
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Of stuff to do with

4487
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Like

4488
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
One of the engine

4489
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Features we have

4490
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Is the ability to read

4491
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
The

4492
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
This is like real

4493
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Technical stuff

4494
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
But

4495
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
To read the material

4496
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
That's on the ground

4497
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
And use that

4498
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
In the shader

4499
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Of a thing

4500
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
That's sitting on top

4501
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Yeah

4502
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
And that lets you

4503
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Do things like

4504
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:26,000
For example

4505
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
We use that in the

4506
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
You know the bear

4507
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
The bear slam

4508
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
When the bear does a slam

4509
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Like the actual ground

4510
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
That's under the bear

4511
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Like the chunks of rubble

4512
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:35,000
That come up

4513
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Are like

4514
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Red from the ground

4515
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
That's actually there

4516
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
So that kind of like

4517
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Fits to the area

4518
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
So that's kind of cool

4519
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
That's very cool

4520
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And

4521
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
There's a few

4522
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
That's actually used

4523
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Quite a lot

4524
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Like in more subtle ways

4525
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
The bear is like

4526
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Really obvious

4527
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Because it's like

4528
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Big chunks of terrain

4529
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:48,000
That kind of

4530
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Come up

4531
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So that's like

4532
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Another one

4533
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
What's another one

4534
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:53,000
That's like

4535
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
PoE2 only

4536
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I'm not sure

4537
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:55,000
As I said

4538
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Most of the things

4539
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Get moved over

4540
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Like I mean look

4541
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:57,000
One of the things

4542
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
That's been

4543
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:58,000
That's gone on generally

4544
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Is that all of the

4545
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Like

4546
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
We've upgraded the

4547
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,000
So we used to use

4548
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
In PoE1

4549
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Originally a like

4550
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
CPU based particle system

4551
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
And then

4552
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
For most of

4553
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
PoE2's development

4554
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
We've had this like

4555
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
GPU based particle system

4556
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
And that just means

4557
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:13,000
That the particles

4558
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Can look way nicer

4559
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
And like that is

4560
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Available in PoE1

4561
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But it's just like

4562
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
All those assets

4563
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Were made like

4564
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
A long time ago

4565
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Right

4566
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,000
So they all use

4567
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
The old system

4568
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
So like just what

4569
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
We're doing with

4570
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Particle systems now

4571
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Is just like way cooler

4572
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
In my opinion

4573
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Like just like

4574
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:25,000
A lot of the

4575
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
There's stuff like

4576
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Like the particles

4577
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Will respond to like

4578
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Wind in the environment

4579
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:30,000
So like

4580
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
If you have like

4581
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Explosions

4582
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:33,000
You can have like

4583
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Wind events on the

4584
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Explosions that will

4585
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Cause like other

4586
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Particles that are

4587
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Around to just get

4588
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Pushed away

4589
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:37,000
And stuff like that

4590
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Like there's just

4591
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Like little cool

4592
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Things like that

4593
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Awesome

4594
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I don't know

4595
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
There's just like

4596
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:42,000
There's nice little

4597
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Touches

4598
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:43,000
But as I said

4599
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
All that stuff is

4600
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Theorically available

4601
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
In PoE1

4602
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
It would require us

4603
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Like redoing a bunch

4604
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Of effects to actually

4605
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Take advantage of it

4606
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
So yeah

4607
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Probably some of the

4608
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Newer stuff in the

4609
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Leagues probably does

4610
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
But yeah

4611
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Most of the stuff

4612
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Isn't that

4613
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Yeah

4614
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Hopefully that answers

4615
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Some of those questions

4616
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
No that was great

4617
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Actually I thought of

4618
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Another thing

4619
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Guild tabs

4620
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Guilds are not

4621
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Transferring over to

4622
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:03,000
PoE2

4623
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
What about

4624
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Guild stash tabs

4625
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
So because of the

4626
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Fact the guild isn't

4627
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
It means the stash tabs

4628
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Aren't either

4629
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And that's kind of

4630
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Unfortunate because I

4631
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Would want that to

4632
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Happen

4633
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
But in order to

4634
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
The guilds just

4635
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Aren't integrated

4636
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Across both games

4637
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
So therefore

4638
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Because one guild

4639
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Owns the tab

4640
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And that guild

4641
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Isn't across

4642
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Like therefore

4643
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
The tabs are where

4644
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:21,000
They are

4645
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
And as I said

4646
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:23,000
That's really not

4647
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
A like policy decision

4648
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
It's just a kind

4649
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Of technical decision

4650
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
So I suppose

4651
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
In order to fix that

4652
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,000
We'd have to merge

4653
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
The guilds of PoE1

4654
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:31,000
And 2

4655
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
And like I wouldn't

4656
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Even be against

4657
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
That idea

4658
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
It just requires

4659
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:35,000
More work than

4660
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
What we have time

4661
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
To do unfortunately

4662
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
So the answer is

4663
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Basically we will

4664
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Have to buy the

4665
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Stash tabs again right

4666
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
You will for that

4667
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Yes unfortunately

4668
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:42,000
But as I said

4669
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I just wish that

4670
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Wasn't the case

4671
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,000
But it just is

4672
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Unfortunately just

4673
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Due to the way

4674
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:46,000
That we couldn't

4675
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Get the kills managed

4676
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:47,000
No that's fine

4677
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Sarah

4678
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Is PoE Mobile

4679
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Still being worked on?

4680
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
It's not being worked on

4681
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Right now

4682
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Like we

4683
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Put it on hold

4684
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
When we

4685
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Like as we realized

4686
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
That we needed

4687
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
The resources

4688
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
And effectively

4689
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:01,000
The people who

4690
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Were working on that

4691
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
They then

4692
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Were the ones

4693
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Who then were

4694
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Taking over

4695
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
The console

4696
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Interface

4697
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
For PoE2

4698
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
So what that meant

4699
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Was that we suddenly

4700
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Had a team

4701
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
That could actually

4702
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Like you know

4703
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Work on all that stuff

4704
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:14,000
And like you know

4705
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Do all the work

4706
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:15,000
That we need to do

4707
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
For console

4708
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
So the intention

4709
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Would be that

4710
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
When we get to the

4711
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Point of like

4712
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Feeling comfortable

4713
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
With like PoE2

4714
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Is fine

4715
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Like all the

4716
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
All the interface

4717
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Stuff is like

4718
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
All resolved

4719
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Like you know

4720
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
We're out of

4721
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,000
We're out of

4722
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Early access

4723
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:26,000
We're kind of

4724
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Like everything's good

4725
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Then we'd be keen

4726
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
To restart the

4727
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Console version

4728
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Sorry the mobile

4729
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Version again

4730
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
But for the time

4731
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Being we're not

4732
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Working on it

4733
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
And yeah

4734
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
We'll just have to

4735
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Get to the point

4736
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Where like feel

4737
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Okay yeah

4738
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
The console version

4739
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Of PoE2

4740
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Is like

4741
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Is good enough

4742
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
That we can get

4743
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Some of the resources

4744
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And move them over again

4745
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Awesome

4746
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
I don't know if

4747
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:46,000
The last one's like

4748
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
A question

4749
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I just want to

4750
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Throw my hat in the

4751
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Oh my god

4752
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Please let us mute

4753
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Other player sounds

4754
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I hate the goblin troops

4755
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I want to throw my hat

4756
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:54,000
In that

4757
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Okay

4763
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Awesome

4764
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
That was pretty much

4765
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000

Out for launch

4769
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
And you're taking time

4770
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
To do this

4771
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:09,000

Thank you so much

01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
And we're very excited

4777
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
To play PoE2

4778
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
When it comes out

4779
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000

Well thank you very much

For you know

4783
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Giving me a chance

01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:20,000
To talk to you guys again

4785
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
It's always fun

4786
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Awesome

4787
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Yeah

4788
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Thank you so much

4789
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000

For everybody watching

4791
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Both YouTube and Twitch

4792
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
All right

4793
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Try to die

4794
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
See you later guys

4795
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Awesome

4796
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
All right

4797
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Bye

4798
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Thank you so much

4799
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Thank you

4800
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Bye

4801
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
No problem

4802
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
All right

4803
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I've got someone to

4804
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I have to go

4805
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Shut off the stream myself

4806
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I guess

4807
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:39,000
All right

4808
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
No that's not good

4809
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Thank you

4810
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Bye

4811
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:41,000
All right

4812
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Thank you

4813
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Bye

4814
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Awesome

4815
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
There it is chat

4816
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
There it is

4817
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
That went pretty well

4818
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I hope I didn't cough too much

4819
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I'm still pretty sick

4820
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
But my fever's mostly gone

4821
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Ah

4822
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I hate being sick

4823
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Oh

4824
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Man

4825
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
It's so like

4826
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
It's so split

4827
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Whenever I ask a question

4828
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
There's like

4829
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Some people like

4830
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
That's the dumbest

4831
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Fucking question

4832
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I've ever heard

4833
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
And some people are like

4834
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:11,000
That's amazing

4835
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And I'm like

4836
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I guess that means

4837
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,000
They're good questions

4838
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
If they're equally

4839
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Like representing

4840
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
And not representing

4841
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
People

4842
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I also feel like

4843
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
A lot of people are like

4844
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Thinking like

4845
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
All the questions

4846
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Are from me

4847
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
But like

4848
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Most of these questions

4849
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Are from other people

4850
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I had like four

4851
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,000
From me

4852
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Hopefully

4853
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Hopefully you like them

4854
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Ah

4855
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Your questions were

4856
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Ultra good

4857
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Thank you

4858
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Here are my goblin troops

4859
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Now fuck your goblin troops

4860
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Oh

4861
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
That was great

4862
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Do you feel satisfied?

4863
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Yeah

4864
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I mean we've already had

4865
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:45,000
A lot of

4866
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
We've already had

4867
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
A lot of good

4868
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Interviews

4869
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
In my opinion

4870
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Every person's interview

4871
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Is good

4872
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Because you get

4873
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Such a different approach

4874
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I know I've seen

4875
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Like

4876
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Every person that does

4877
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
The interview

4878
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Gets some form of backlash

4879
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
But I love that

4880
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
They do so many

4881
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Different interviews

4882
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Because you

4883
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
You get so many

4884
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Insights in different

4885
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Parts of the community

4886
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
So I love that

4887
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:06,000
They do multiple

4888
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
And not just one

4889
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I think it's

4890
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
It's really good

4891
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
And thank you so much

4892
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
For all the subs and resubs

4893
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I super appreciate that

4894
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Super super appreciate that

4895
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
He's doing so many interviews

4896
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Yeah

4897
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
It's crazy good

4898
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
No preload

4899
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Second message to DL

4900
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
No

4901
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Oh that is such a big W

4902
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
By the way

4903
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I'm biased

4904
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Because I don't have

4905
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
A dog shit connection

4906
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
But such a big W

4907
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
In my opinion

4908
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Do pre-download

4909
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Like three hours ahead

4910
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Or six hours ahead

4911
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I hate

4912
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Data mining

4913
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
But I'm biased

4914
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I mean we're all biased

4915
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Right we're all biased

4916
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
To our situation

4917
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
What's your opinion

4918
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
On the leaked walkthrough

4919
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
By Fextra Life

4920
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Oh I mean

4921
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I fucking hate

4922
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Fextra Life

4923
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I agree with Lily

4924
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Who posted a very

4925
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Based tweet

4926
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Saying there's

4927
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Scourge on gaming

4928
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:55,000
As a whole

4929
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Or a blight

4930
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I think the blight

4931
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Was what she said

4932
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Um

4933
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:05,000
It's like

4934
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
If it was only

4935
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
That they've done

4936
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Like five

4937
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Or six shady things

4938
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
That's fine

4939
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,000
But it's like

4940
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Ten plus

4941
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,000
And it's like

4942
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
At some point

4943
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
People should stop

4944
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Giving them

4945
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Any opportunities

4946
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
This is actually

4947
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Mad yeah

4948
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Just cause of the

4949
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Embed thing

4950
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
No it's just so many things

4951
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
The embed thing

4952
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Is definitely

4953
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
A big part of it

4954
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Uh I think

4955
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Fextra Life

4956
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Gets a lot of hate

4957
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
But I personally

4958
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Think they don't

4959
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Get enough

4960
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:33,000
I agree

4961
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Salty Dane

4962
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I agree

4963
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Um

4964
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I've heard

4965
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
So many

4966
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Slimy things

4967
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:40,000
From them

4968
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
From like

4969
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Actual companies

4970
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Too

4971
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,000
So like

4972
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I just

4973
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I really

4974
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Dislike them

4975
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Fextra Life

4976
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
If you're reading

4977
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:54,000
This

4978
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Ignore the

4979
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Positive comments

4980
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Based

4981
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Hope you feel better

4982
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Yeah I'm

4983
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I'm a lot better now

4984
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
That's a lot of people

4985
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
That tuned in

4986
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Man some guy posted

4987
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
During that on YouTube

4988
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Like he's ignoring

4989
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,000
YouTube chat

4990
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
It's like

4991
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Brother

4992
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Like what

4993
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Oh shit

4994
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:20,000
So

4995
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
So annoying

4996
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:22,000
It's like

4997
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I'm ignoring

4998
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
All of you equally

4999
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
That's really cool though

5000
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Like 18,000

5001
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Or something on Twitch

5002
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
And like 13

5003
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Or 14 on YouTube

5004
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Thanks for the amazing interview

5005
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Yeah I hope I did okay

5006
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Somebody was asking

5007
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Like why is he not prepared more

5008
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And I was like

5009
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
I felt super prepared

5010
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I'm just sick

5011
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Like huh

5012
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I prepared so much

5013
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Like a big spreadsheet

5014
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I even prepared

5015
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Follow up questions

5016
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Uh

5017
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Five person

5018
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Called that person dumb

5019
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Yeah that's good

5020
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
You did great

5021
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Thanks

5022
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Thanks for asking

5023
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
About kilts

5024
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I wasn't going to

5025
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,000
That was really far

5026
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Down the list

5027
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Um

5028
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I was

5029
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I had set aside

5030
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,000
More time

5031
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
To talk about

5032
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Ascendancies

5033
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Um

5034
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
But it didn't feel

5035
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
That useful

5036
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
To talk about more

5037
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Other than you know

5038
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Express my discontent

5039
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
When he hadn't really

5040
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Changed his mind

5041
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Or thought about it more

5042
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Um

5043
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Yeah he didn't

5044
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
He didn't want to

5045
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Talk about it

5046
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:25,000
It seemed like

5047
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:25,000
So I

5048
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I didn't really want to

5049
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Push that

5050
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
If that makes sense

5051
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Um

5052
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
When he hadn't had time

5053
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
To talk about it

5054
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Since last

5055
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Think about it

5056
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Since last time

5057
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Double your rarity

5058
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Question

5059
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Now is another thing

5060
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I wasn't going to ask

5061
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I mean

5062
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Most of the

5063
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
10-15 things

5064
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:41,000
At the end

5065
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Were things

5066
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:42,000
I hadn't planned

5067
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:42,000
On asking

5068
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Um

5069
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I praise you

5070
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
For asking about goblins

5071
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I fucking hate goblins

5072
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Dude

5073
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Like the force and clip

5074
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Does anyone have

5075
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
The force and clip

5076
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
This is why

5077
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I asked about goblins

5078
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Someone link the force and clip

5079
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
And I know

5080
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
This is not everybody's experience

5081
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
But I want to show off

5082
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,000
The force and clip

5083
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Why is fuck

5084
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Getting censored

5085
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I love fuck

5086
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Ah

5087
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Perfect

5088
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I

5089
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
I would probably just

5090
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Show this to Jonathan

5091
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
As to why

5092
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I hate

5093
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
The goblins

5094
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Oh my god

5095
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Uh

5096
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Was there one

5097
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Uh

5098
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I don't have the waypoint there

5099
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
What

5100
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Is this important

5101
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
For the quest

5102
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Oh I'm level 20

5103
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Ah

5104
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I'm level 20

5105
01:52:51,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Now

5106
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:02,000
I

5107
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I do see the humor in this

5108
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I think it's funny

5109
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
But I play this game

5110
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Too much

5111
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
To want this

5112
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
In my fucking game

5113
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Imagine sitting there

5114
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Trying to listen to lore

5115
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
For the people

5116
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
That care about that

5117
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Like fuck me dude

5118
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
And I know

5119
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:17,000
That this is a more

5120
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Extreme version

5121
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Because it is forcing

5122
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
It is

5123
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
But holy fuck dude

5124
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Who did that to you?

5125
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Oh

5126
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I play hardcore

5127
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
I'm entirely

5128
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Unaffected by this

5129
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
There is one other person

5130
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,000
That plays hardcore

5131
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
On the same server

5132
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
That I do

5133
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Right

5134
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Cause it's spread out

5135
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:39,000
With like Milan

5136
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Paris

5137
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:40,000
London

5138
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
So it's not a me problem

5139
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
This is definitely

5140
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Something I'm asking

5141
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
For the community

5142
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Right

5143
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
No it is me and Steel

5144
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
On the server we play on

5145
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
It's just

5146
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
A very cancerous

5147
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Dude

5148
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I love

5149
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
How candid they are

5150
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
In interviews

5151
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:01,000
And again

5152
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Thank you so much

5153
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,000
For all the subs

5154
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And resubs

5155
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I super appreciate it

5156
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,000
The clip you watched

5157
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Is in hardcore SSF

5158
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
By the way

5159
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Yes

5160
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
But I would still argue

5161
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,000
That it is more of a

5162
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Selfcore trade experience

5163
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Because those people

5164
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Are doing that

5165
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Because it is forcing

5166
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
If that was any other player

5167
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:15,000
That town would not

5168
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Look like that

5169
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
So

5170
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Are you playing

5171
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Peewee to hardcore

5172
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:22,000
From the beginning?

5173
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Yeah I mean

5174
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
There's no reason not to

5175
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I'm going to start by

5176
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I'm absolutely like

5177
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Continuing on software

5178
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:27,000
When I die

5179
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I'm continuing on software

5180
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:30,000
When I die

5181
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I'm doing a key giveaway

5182
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
On twitter by the way

5183
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
We'll do some key giveaways

5184
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Honestly

5185
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Is Vyro still here?

5186
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Vyro can you do giveaways

5187
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:36,000
For me?

5188
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
If so

5189
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Should we give away

5190
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Some keys now?

5191
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:41,000
We could give away

5192
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Some keys now

5193
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,000
On twitch

5194
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
There is a key

5195
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Giveaway on twitter

5196
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Honestly

5197
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
I just saw that

5198
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
That it's just too easy

5199
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
To farm

5200
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Interactions

5201
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
On twitter

5202
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:51,000
By giving away

5203
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
For a few keys

5204
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
And I was like

5205
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Fuck that

5206
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I'm dumb not to do this

5207
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:54,000
So

5208
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
But we'll just give away

5209
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Some in twitch

5210
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Tattoo I think

5211
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Is Vyro here?

5212
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I was just like

5213
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I saw somebody

5214
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Got like 6,000 likes

5215
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
For two keys

5216
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:04,000
And I'm like

5217
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
The fuck?

5218
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I'm gonna throw up

5219
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Five keys

5220
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Fuck all y'all

5221
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I was like

5222
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Huh?

5223
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
That's fucking stupid

5224
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
They said

5225
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Give me five minutes

5226
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Okay cool

5227
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
We're gonna give away

5228
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Some keys here

5229
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Honestly

5230
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:17,000
We're gonna give away

5231
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
A bunch of keys

5232
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
I think we have like

5233
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:19,000
20 to give away

5234
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I don't know if we'll

5235
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Give them all away now

5236
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Who cares about likes?

5237
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I mean

5238
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I do

5239
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
It's cringe

5240
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:31,000
But like

5241
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Realistically

5242
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
The more people

5243
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Interact with me

5244
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
In any space

5245
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:36,000
The better for me

5246
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
As a content creator

5247
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
It is sadly my job

5248
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
To farm interactions

5249
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I generally try to do that

5250
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:43,000
In a positive way

5251
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
And not like a cringe way

5252
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
This is definitely

5253
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
More on the cringe side

5254
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I do realize that

5255
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:48,000
But you know

5256
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
It is what it is

5257
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
As far as cringe goes

5258
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:51,000
I think

5259
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
It's pretty limited

5260
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Compared to like

5261
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Rage bait

5262
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:55,000
And stuff like that

5263
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Now

5264
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
We don't

5265
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Like

5266
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
People always ask

5267
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Is he ignoring

5268
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
YouTube chat?

5269
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:05,000
No

5270
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
But YouTube chat

5271
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Will definitely be

5272
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Fucked by giveaways

5273
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I realistically

5274
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Don't have a way

5275
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
To include

5276
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
YouTube giveaways

5277
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
So you do actually

5278
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Get fucked here YouTube

5279
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I'm so sorry

5280
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
You do actually

5281
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Get fucked here

5282
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:23,000
But I do read you

5283
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
We're trying to get

5284
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Like a good way

5285
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,000
For this subathon

5286
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
To work on YouTube

5287
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I've seen a lot

5288
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Of other content creators

5289
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
That are just going to

5290
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Ignore YouTube

5291
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I don't really want

5292
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
To ignore YouTube

5293
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Get fucked YouTube

5294
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Oh my god

5295
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Luality was giving me

5296
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Advice yesterday

5297
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:41,000
So I'm doing

5298
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Baldur's Gate 3

5299
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Honor mode

5300
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
And she was

5301
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Molding when she

5302
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Saw my gear

5303
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Because I'm level 10

5304
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
And I had like

5305
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
A medium breastplate

5306
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
On my Gloomstalker

5307
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
And she was like

5308
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
What the actual fuck

5309
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
She was having a full on

5310
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Meltdown

5311
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
And she was like

5312
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Half your gear

5313
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Doesn't fucking do anything

5314
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
It was like a Sunday roast

5315
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
She was literally

5316
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Like molding

5317
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,000
She

5318
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
She like linked me

5319
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:02,000
A gif

5320
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Of how she felt

5321
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Luality was like

5322
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:09,000
This

5323
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
This is my reaction

5324
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
To your fucking gear

5325
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:19,000
She was like

5326
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
So bad

5327
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
9,000 YouTube viewers

5328
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I know

5329
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I mean I do try to be

5330
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Pretty respectful

5331
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
To my YouTube audience

5332
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
It's just

5333
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Twitch ads are predatory

5334
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
YouTube almost too

5335
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
So the Twitch ads

5336
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
At least for my channel

5337
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
I don't disagree with you

5338
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:34,000
By the way

5339
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
It's why I use Turbo

5340
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
But the Twitch ads

5341
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Are always entirely

5342
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Run by the streamer

5343
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Except for channels

5344
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
That don't run ads

5345
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Then you'll get

5346
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:43,000
First pre-rolls

5347
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
But like when

5348
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Streamers are saying

5349
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Oh Twitch are going

5350
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Really hard on ads

5351
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
They are lying

5352
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
There is a streamer

5353
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Like anytime you get

5354
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,000
An ad on Twitch

5355
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
It's just me

5356
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Running the ad for you

5357
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
It's just most people

5358
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Lie about it

5359
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
So I run three minutes

5360
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
An hour on Twitch

5361
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
And I try to time

5362
01:57:59,000 --> 01:57:59,000
That really well

5363
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
With like

5364
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I'll never do it

5365
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:01,000
In the middle of a

5366
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Boss fight

5367
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Or anything like that

5368
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
It's just completely

5369
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Out of my hands

5370
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I just really like money

5371
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
So I try to be

5372
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Really careful

5373
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:09,000
About how I run ads

5374
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Like for example

5375
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Before this podcast

5376
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I actually ran

5377
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Technically nine minutes

5378
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Of ads right before

5379
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
The podcast started

5380
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:15,000
And then we didn't

5381
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Have any ads

5382
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
In the middle of the podcast

5383
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,000
So at least for my channel

5384
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I very much curate

5385
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
How I run ads

5386
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Like accidents do happen

5387
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Where I fuck you over

5388
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
By accident

5389
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
It is still me doing it

5390
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Except when I use

5391
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
All five minute delays

5392
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And then forget

5393
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:32,000
It's Twitch's fault

5394
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Then it's Twitch's fault

5395
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Yeah

5396
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I mean you do run out

5397
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Of delays

5398
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
I can just like

5399
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Quickly show you

5400
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
How it looks

5401
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,000
From my end

5402
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
So I have it

5403
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,000
On an automatic timer

5404
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,000
So this plays

5405
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Three minutes per hour

5406
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
And then I see here

5407
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
That in 37 minutes

5408
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Ads are gonna start

5409
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:48,000
And click snooze

5410
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
And then I have

5411
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Three snoozes

5412
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
So basically this choice

5413
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
To keep me right

5414
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
For three minutes an hour

5415
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,000
That's like the sweet spot

5416
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:54,000
For making money

5417
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
So ads are a pain

5418
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,000
But like I like

5419
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Making money from what I do

5420
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
So it is what it is

5421
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:01,000
You can also like

5422
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Sub if you really hate it

5423
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:09,000
That podcast was for

5424
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Drop frames

5425
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
No drop frames

5426
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It was yesterday

5427
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
It does disable pre-rolls

5428
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
For narrowing

5429
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Send to a narrow relay

5430
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
See if that works

5431
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Okay so we are going to

5432
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Try to do

5433
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
A key giveaway

5434
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
How many keys

5435
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Do we have to give away

5436
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
How many do you want to do

5437
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
How many do we have

5438
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
We have 700

5439
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I'm just kidding

5440
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
You didn't say that

5441
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
I imagine though

5442
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Where's browser source

5443
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Key giveaway

5444
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
How about 11,000

5445
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I wish I had that many

5446
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,000
You know what

5447
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Fuck it

5448
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
How about

5449
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
We do a big one

5450
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
We do like seven keys

5451
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Right now dude

5452
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Let's see

5453
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
If this works

5454
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
It might

5455
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Now this will not work

5456
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
On YouTube sadly

5457
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
So you will have to

5458
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Fuck over onto Twitch

5459
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Because it only reads

5460
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:56,000
The Twitch chat

5461
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
And obviously there will be

5462
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
People not realizing that

5463
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
And we'll spam whatever

5464
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
The thing will be on YouTube

5465
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
But we'll give away

5466
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Seven keys right now

5467
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
There should be a key giveaway

5468
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:06,000
That'll pop up

5469
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
And again I'm so sorry
