1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The End

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Sir, just what are we facing here?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A relic of the old world.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ready your men, Captain.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We will only get one chance.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And remember, when you hear the whispers, call for help.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Do not attack!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
When you hear the whispers, what do you think he was on about?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's Dorman, right?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Uh, yeah.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then Dorman. Shut your damn mouth.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why do I always get stuck with these rookies?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, the kid's got a mean cleave. Give him a chance.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Quiet!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Come on.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Leave, eh, Captain?

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A rookie can't even lift his own sword.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Captain Oren?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Captain?

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's here.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Rain! Send the signal!

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What the fuck?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Rain!

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
On my back, we'll be laid off!

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Come on, come on!

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm ready!

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm ready!

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a man!

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's not!

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Run!

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Captain!

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Captain...

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Captain!

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why are you here?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What is this?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Stop!

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Humanity isn't ready.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
On your feet, lad.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sir...

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The captain, I...

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You'll be fine.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Here.....

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What is it?

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Get the body.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Stop.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mortal.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It can still be contained.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You don't know what you have unleashed.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Your kind no longer control this world.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We cannot destroy your body, it's true.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But you will watch as we destroy everything you have built.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Bind him!

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Feed.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Grow, my child.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll make sure you can eat your fill.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, my child.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What?

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Hi, I'm Jonathan Rogers, Game Director on Path of Exile 2.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now, Path of Exile 2 is going into early access in around two weeks on December the 6th.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But even though it's early access, this isn't just some small taste.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The game is huge.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In this livestream we're going to be introducing everything you can expect.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So without further ado, let's roll the gameplay trailer.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Existence is a thing of beauty.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Precious, but impermanent.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Life and death are mortal enemies.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And yet, bound to one another.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The continuation of life must be protected at all costs.

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Some have said, my methods are going to.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
To this I say, there can be no salvation without sacrifice.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Gunfighterganal pometheus!

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Satisfactionся!

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's go!

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We are faced with the end, and I will do what I must.

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Those who obsess with death, let them soon be acquainted with it.

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now, as you just saw, even in Early Access, Path of Exile 2 is a big game.

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's actually been five years since we announced PoE 2, and over that time we've revealed a

79
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
lot, but it's been in bits and pieces.

80
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's pretty hard to keep track of it all, so today we're going to do a full rundown

81
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
of all the content that will be available at the start of Early Access.

82
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Classes, character progression systems, and for the first time, a full overview of the

83
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
end game.

84
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is going to be a big one, so get comfortable.

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
For 20 years, Wraeclast has been free from any sources of corruption, but the Count of Ogham,

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
tempted by promises of power, intends to harness it once more.

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The dead are rising.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Monsters are mutating, and madness is spreading.

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Under the dark influence of corruption, the Count doles out sentences of death to any who

90
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
would question him.

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
One, two, three.

92
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
One, two, three.

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And this is where you find yourself at the start of PoE 2.

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Explore the dark forests of Ogham.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Traverse the barren plains of the Vesteri Desert.

96
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And delve into the jungle ruins of Utsal, an ancient Val city.

97
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There are challenging monsters, hidden runes, lost camps and treasures, roaming merchants,

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and, of course, unique bosses.

99
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No two areas are the same.

100
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It falls to you to track down the seed of corruption, the source of all this devastation.

101
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
On the way, you'll face fearsome monsters, meet strange characters, forge unlikely bonds,

102
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and uncover lost civilizations.

103
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But first, you'll need to pick a class.

104
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Now, Early Access will initially have six classes available.

105
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's have a look at them.

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter.

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He dashes in and out of combat, and has mechanics that involve building up and keeping momentum.

108
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Like all classes in PoE 2, you'll want to use a wide variety of skills to mix and match different combos.

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
To get new skills, you'll first need to find skill gems.

110
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Using a skill gem will open the Gem Cutting menu, which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can choose an existing...

112
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
so many weapons that seem a toujours

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
looked like a herzlich foot.

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And also the other thing about the

115
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you.

116
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Thank you.

117
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you.

118
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Thank you.

119
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Thank you.

120
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Thank you.

121
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Thank you.

122
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you.

123
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Thank you.

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Thank you.

125
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Thank you.

126
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you.

127
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Thank you.

128
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Thank you.

129
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Thank you.

130
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you.

131
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Thank you.

132
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you.

133
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Thank you.

134
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you.

135
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you.

136
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Thank you.

137
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Thank you.

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you.

139
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you.

140
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you.

141
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Thank you.

142
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Thank you.

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Thank you.

144
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Thank you.

145
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Thank you.

146
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the jungle ruins of Utsau, an ancient Val city.

147
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
There are challenging monsters, hidden runes,

148
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
lost camps and treasures, roaming merchants,

149
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and of course, unique bosses.

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No two areas are the same.

151
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It falls to you to track down the seed of corruption,

152
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the source of all this devastation.

153
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
On the way, you'll face fearsome monsters,

154
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
meet strange characters, forge unlikely bonds,

155
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and uncover lost civilizations.

156
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But first, you'll need to pick a class.

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Now, Early Access will initially have six classes available.

158
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Let's have a look at them.

159
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter.

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He dashes in and out of combat, and his mechanics

161
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
involve building up and keeping momentum.

162
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Like all classes in POE2, you'll want

163
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
to use a wide variety of skills to mix and match different combos.

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
To get new skills, you'll first need to find skill gems.

165
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Using a skill gem will open the Gem Cutting menu,

166
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
which shows all the active skills available in POE2.

167
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You can choose an existing skill to level up,

168
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
or choose to engrave a new one.

169
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Since this is a level 7 skill gem,

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
even if you pick a new skill, it will immediately be level 7,

171
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
so there's no harm in trying out something new.

172
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The Monk primarily uses the Quarterstaff.

173
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There are three skills of martial arts.

174
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Lightning, Ice, and Wind.

175
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But don't think you have to stick to just one.

176
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The best combos are going to involve mixing elements of all three.

177
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's try Killing Palm.

178
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Like many Monk skills, this can be used to quickly take advantage

179
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
of a specific situation.

180
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If there's an enemy on low life, you can use Killing Palm

181
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to dash to them and kill them instantly.

182
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This will provide a power charge.

183
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then we can use a different skill to consume that power charge

184
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
for a much more devastating attack.

185
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The Monk also has powerful combo skills.

186
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Tempest Bell, for example, is a skill that places a giant resonating bell.

187
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Hitting the bell causes it to ring, dealing damage to all enemies around it.

188
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You can also do things like freeze or shock the bell,

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
which will add elemental damage to the strikes.

190
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The Monk also has a variety of abilities to empower his staff.

191
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If an enemy is close to being stunned,

192
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you can use Staggering Palm to punch them down.

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
After that, any attack you do will shoot out wind projectiles.

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There are 21 active skills for quarter staves,

195
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
so this just scratches the surface of the options that you have.

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
By endgame, you'll be dashing from pack to pack,

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
spewing projectiles and obliterating screens of enemies

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
with huge combo attacks.

199
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Now if you like a style of melee that's a little slower but hits much harder,

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
then the Warrior is for you.

201
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He pounds the ground with big chunky attacks

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
and can shrug off the hits of small enemies with large amounts of armor.

203
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Even though the mace slams are slow, you never lose control.

204
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Longer attacks can be retargeted as you go,

205
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and if you find yourself committed to a long attack,

206
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you can dodge roll out of it at any time.

207
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Among the skill options for maces,

208
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you'll find a variety of slams, fire attacks, war cries and shield skills.

209
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Here I'm going to slam the ground,

210
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
rending it apart with lines of fire.

211
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Any slam skill will then cause these fissures to erupt with lava.

212
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I can even run through them with a skill like Stampede

213
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to do huge amounts of damage.

214
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The Warrior can also use war cries,

215
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
which can empower your next skill.

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Seismic Cry, for example,

217
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
will double any slams from the next attack.

218
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The Stampede counts as a slam,

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
so it can double that for even more craziness.

220
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
If you want to go a little faster and be a little more defensive,

221
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
equip a shield.

222
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
In PoE 2, you can raise your shield at any time

223
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
to block all damage from the front, even spells.

224
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
While holding up your shield,

225
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
your stun meter will build as you take damage.

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So be careful.

227
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
If it reaches 100%,

228
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
your stance will break and you will be vulnerable.

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Some enemies also have unblockable attacks,

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
which are indicated by this red flash.

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If you see one of these coming,

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
make sure to dodge out of the way.

233
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Using a shield also gives you access to shield skills,

234
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
like Shield Charge,

235
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
which allows you to charge towards enemies and stun them.

236
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
While charging,

237
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you're also blocking the whole time,

238
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
so you have full damage immunity from the front.

239
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The Warrior also has access to totems.

240
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Some totems have built-in abilities,

241
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
like Shockwave Totem,

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
which can be placed to stun nearby enemies

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and trigger aftershocks like those from the Earthquake.

244
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But you can also get Ancestral Warrior Totems,

245
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
which allow you to use any slam skill in your repertoire.

246
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
This is a meta skill,

247
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
which means that it's a skill you can put other skills into.

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I can take a slam like Sunder and socket it into my Ancestral Warrior Totem.

249
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Now when I summon him,

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
he'll sit there and slam the monsters from a distance.

251
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There are 20 active skills for Maces,

252
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
so there's a lot more to try out.

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But by endgame, you're going to be dropping Hammish from the sky,

254
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
leaping fearlessly into combat

255
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and separating the very Earth you stand on.

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Time for some ranged attacks.

257
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The Ranger is primarily about the bow,

258
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but we wanted to make sure that she feels agile as well.

259
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
In Pee-wee 2 you can shoot while moving.

260
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Combined with all the skills the Ranger has

261
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
that allow you to jump around,

262
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
you'll have a lot of mobility in combat.

263
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Bow skills have a variety of Lightning, Poison,

264
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Ice and physical attacks.

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Lightning attacks bounce around between targets.

266
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You can also stick with cap at carduates

267
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
andatori so ninetyy 이런 calls.

268
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You can also stick lightning arrows in the ground which explode when hit by the bouncers,

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
or electrocute enemies to take them out of combat.

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Ice attacks are later slow and freeze enemies to keep them away from you.

271
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Using poison, not only can you slowly damage your enemies from afar,

272
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but also grow some interesting plants.

273
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
With 21 bow skills and all the mobility and combo tools the ranger has,

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
you can take advantage of every situation.

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
By endgame you'll be creating hundreds of arrows,

276
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
be they falling from the sky, bouncing around between enemies, or spraying out of tornadoes.

277
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You might have noticed in the bottom left of the screen that the flask slots look a little different.

278
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
In Pee-wee 2 you have one dedicated life flask slot and one mana flask slot.

279
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Flasks gain charges as you kill enemies,

280
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and typically allow you to heal six or seven times if they're full.

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But that's not the only thing you can use charges for.

282
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Charms are a new item type that will automatically defend you from various debuffs or damage types.

283
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Having trouble with getting frozen?

284
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Equip a thawing charm.

285
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
When it's fully charged, it will make you immune to freeze for three seconds if you get frozen.

286
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
To recharge them, just kill more monsters.

287
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You can gain more slots for charms by upgrading your belt.

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The mercenary wields a crossbow that can be loaded with different ammo types,

289
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
offering versatility, power, and mobility.

290
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
All classes in Path of Exile 2 can be controlled with WASD,

291
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
which makes this class play exactly like a shooter.

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
For the crossbow, you will find skills that work like shotguns,

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
sniper rifles,

294
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
assault rifles,

295
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and even grenade launchers.

296
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But not only that,

297
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
there are a wide variety of more interesting elemental ammos too.

298
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's very fast to switch between ammo types,

299
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
so long as you already have them loaded,

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
which makes the mercenary able to combo abilities together for devastating effect.

301
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Use Glacial Bolt to create walls of ice to separate enemies,

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
then switch to Fragmentation rounds to explode the ice,

303
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
dealing massive AoE damage.

304
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If I come across an armoured enemy,

305
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I could use armour-piercing rounds to break their armour,

306
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and then high-velocity rounds to take them down.

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Or perhaps I could fire a gas grenade to poison enemies

308
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
before detonating the cloud with an explosive shot for massive damage.

309
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If you want to call in some suppressing fire,

310
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you can summon artillery ballisters.

311
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
These have a minimum range,

312
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
so you'll want to prepare your position carefully before moving in.

313
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There are 22 active skills for crossbows.

314
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
By endgame, you'll be calling destruction down from the sky

315
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
as you litter the battlefield with grenades

316
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and pepper your enemies with your automatic shotgun.

317
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If you're looking to take a backseat and let your minions do the work,

318
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
then the witch should be your choice.

319
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
She can call forth hordes of undead monsters to fight for her,

320
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
while casting powerful chaos spells that debilitate her enemies.

321
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Occult skills are some of the most varied in the game,

322
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
with skeletons, noxious spells,

323
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
specialty minions, curses and sacrificial magic.

324
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Before we talk about minions,

325
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
we'll have to talk about a new resource in Path of Exile 2 called Spirit.

326
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is a spirit gem,

327
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
which allows you to pick from a range of persistent skills.

328
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
All classes have a variety of these skills,

329
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
which can add some very interesting effects,

330
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
like Arctic armor,

331
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
which does cold damage to enemies that hit you,

332
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
or raging spirits,

333
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
which summon fiery skulls each time you cast a fire spell.

334
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
For the witch, though,

335
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
we'll want to be using our spirit to create permanent minions.

336
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
These minions will be revived automatically when they die,

337
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
so you don't have to worry about resummoning them all the time.

338
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Here, I'm using the skill screen to allocate which minions I would like in my horde.

339
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You can see the spirit cost of each one.

340
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Skeletal warriors are cheap, but weak,

341
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
useful for tanking damage and distracting enemies.

342
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But I want more heavy hitters in my army,

343
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
so I'm going to unsummon some warriors and instead add skeletal arsonists.

344
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Permanent minions come with special active abilities called command skills.

345
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You can order these guys to detonate your own minions for even more damage and air of effect.

346
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If you want a bigger army, you'll need a scepter.

347
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This new weapon type is imbued with even more spirit,

348
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
allowing you to summon even more friends.

349
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And if you want an even bigger army than that,

350
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
you can take advantage of corpses to summon true hordes of minions.

351
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But what can a witch do while her army is at work?

352
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Well, she has a range of chaos spells to spread disease amongst your enemies,

353
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
or bone skills to impale them.

354
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Or, you know, you could curse them to make them weaker so your horde can take them down.

355
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
There are 25 active occult skills.

356
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
By the endgame, you'll be the leader of a fearsome army of the dead,

357
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
consuming everything in its path.

358
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The sorceress bends the elements to her will,

359
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
using them to unleash devastation on her foes.

360
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
This classic spellcaster weaves a flurry of elemental magic from afar.

361
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The elemental skills have everything you might expect and more.

362
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Fireballs, icy explosions, lightning storms, you get the idea.

363
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Each spell is unique and has many different ways to build and combo with others,

364
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
even between different elements.

365
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
For example, flame wall conjures a burning line that not only damages enemies,

366
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
but also empowers all projectiles that pass through it.

367
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If you place a wall and fire lightning sparks through it,

368
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
they'll gain extra fire damage.

369
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's a good idea to take advantage of the ability to automatically swap weapons when you use certain skills.

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Having a special staff with bonuses to fire skills and another with bonuses to lightning skills can really power up a combo like this.

371
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The sorceress can also take advantage of powerful trigger jams.

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
For example, you could grab the cast and ignite gem and use it with firestorm.

373
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
As you ignite enemies, a counter will go up in the top left corner.

374
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
When it's full, a firestorm will automatically be cast at the enemy that was ignited.

375
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
There are 25 active elemental skills.

376
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
By endgame, you'll be firing off projectiles left and right as you rain down elemental storms on your foes.

377
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Now, those are the characters that will be available at the start of early access,

378
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
but we will be adding six more character classes with just as many skills and options as these.

379
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
There's a lot more to come.

380
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
There's one more important thing to mention about skills.

381
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Even though we talk about them as belong to each class,

382
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
in reality, there are no restrictions.

383
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You can use all these skills on any class so long as you have the attributes.

384
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
For example, a poison ranger might want to try out using occult curses to increase her poison damage,

385
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
or a monk might want to trigger elemental ice walls to use with his glacial cascade combo.

386
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The possibilities for cross-class combos are practically unlimited.

387
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
We're looking forward to what kind of things you guys might find.

388
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Now, Path of Exile is a game known for build customization,

389
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and we haven't even scratched the surface of what is possible yet.

390
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So let's talk about support gems.

391
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Path of Exile 2 has a system of support gems that can be combined with your active skills

392
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
to dramatically change the way they work.

393
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
If you find a support gem, then right-clicking it will open up this screen.

394
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Here you will find a variety of recommended support gems for each of your skills that you can pick between.

395
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
For example, this is a multiple projectiles support gem,

396
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and can be used to add multiple projectiles to any skill.

397
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Normally, when you fire a grenade, it'll look like this.

398
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But if we add multiple projectiles, then you get three of them.

399
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Once you have the gem, you can also freely move it between any of the skills on your character.

400
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
If you want to have a multi-shot sniper rifle instead,

401
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
then simply move the gem over to your high-velocity round skill.

402
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Generally speaking, if it sounds like a support gem should work with a skill, then it will work.

403
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So it's a good idea to experiment.

404
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Note that you can only have one of each support gem on your character,

405
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
so you'll want to think carefully about which supports can be used best with each skill for maximum damage.

406
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Now, if you want to stick to the recommendations, you should have a perfectly good time.

407
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But if you want to experiment a bit more, then uncheck that recommended button,

408
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and you can see the full list of supports that will work with your skill.

409
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
There are hundreds of support gems to choose from,

410
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and even we don't know the results of all the possible ways these can interact.

411
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Each skill can have up to five supports socketed into it.

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And if you're clever, you can come up with some pretty interesting ideas.

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Now, all of this is just scratching the surface.

414
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You can make frost vortexes, break people's armor, make minions explode, make skills repeat.

415
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Make enemies set each other on fire, cull enemies, or pin them to the ground.

416
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Supports let you drastically change the behavior of your skills and create your own unique build,

417
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
or at least follow someone's OP build guide.

418
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So, speaking of builds, let's talk about one of the most iconic Path of Exile systems,

419
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
the Passive Skill Tree.

420
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes, it's huge.

421
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
There are over 1,500 nodes on there.

422
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Now, a lot of people open the tree and can get a little intimidated at first,

423
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
but try not to be scared.

424
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
There are lots of options, but at its core, it's pretty simple.

425
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Each level, you get one point to put into the tree.

426
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Each class starts at a different location, but they all share the same tree.

427
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Around your section of the tree, you'll find relevant bonuses for your character.

428
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You should be safe in the knowledge that there aren't many wrong choices here.

429
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Almost all the starting nodes will be useful for your character in some way.

430
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But if you do happen to make a choice you regret,

431
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you'll be able to respec any nodes you've taken by spending a little bit of gold.

432
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Now, the tree is generally divided up into clusters which have similar themes.

433
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
In each cluster, you will find small nodes that give simple bonuses like increased damage,

434
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
but the real power comes from notables.

435
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Notables normally have much more interesting bonuses,

436
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and they tend to care a lot more about how your build works and what skills you're using.

437
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
For example, in the Mercenary area of the tree,

438
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
this one gives a 25% chance for crossbow skills to not consume a bolt.

439
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And here's one that gives grenades a chance to blow up a second time.

440
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
This one gives a chance for projectiles to rebound off terrain,

441
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
as well as giving you some pierce chance to make that more likely.

442
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Note that even though this is in the Mercenary section,

443
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
this would work with projectiles from all classes,

444
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
so there are often reasons to go to different areas of the tree.

445
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
In order to get between these clusters,

446
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you will generally have to allocate nodes in the attribute highways.

447
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Attribute nodes allow you to pick which attribute you would like to use,

448
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
so it's very easy to get points for any attribute that your gear might need.

449
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You can change which attribute these nodes give you for half price at the respec vendor.

450
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
In addition to notables, you will also find even larger passives called keystones.

451
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Keystones have both an upside and a downside,

452
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and often require changing your entire build to design around them.

453
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
A great example is Giant's Blood,

454
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
which allows you to wield two-hand weapons in a single hand,

455
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
but doubles the attribute requirements of them.

456
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You can use a two-hand mace with a shield, or even dual-wield them.

457
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Or how about Mind Over Matter,

458
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
which makes all damage go to your mana pool first before your life pool,

459
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
but you lose 50% of your mana regen?

460
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Skills like these can be tough to build around,

461
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
but if you're up for the challenge, they can be very rewarding.

462
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
As we showed you earlier on the Sorceress,

463
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
you can swap between weapon sets on the fly as you use certain skills.

464
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
One of the new features in Path of Exile 2's passive tree

465
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
is that you can choose to have your passive tree change

466
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
as you switch between weapon sets

467
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to take advantage of specific bonuses on the tree.

468
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
For the Sorceress, you might want to change between

469
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
fire and lightning specialization.

470
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Or you could switch between one-hand and a two-hand setup

471
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
in order to be able to block boss attacks

472
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
while following up with heavy hits from your bigger mace.

473
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Or perhaps you could have a full curse setup on your witch

474
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
to debuff enemies before switching to a Chaos Degen build for maximum damage.

475
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If you want to stick with just one weapon set,

476
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
you can just use these specialization points as bonus points

477
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
to invest however you like,

478
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
but creative players will find plenty of opportunities with this system.

479
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You can get weapon specialization points throughout the campaign

480
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
from optional bosses and quests.

481
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
For example, if I manage to defeat the Crowbell,

482
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'll get a weapon specialization book.

483
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
There are lots of other permanent boosts available from the campaign too.

484
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
On the map, you can see icons that indicate

485
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
the many optional encounters you can find.

486
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Some of them have permanent character boosts

487
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and others have powerful items.

488
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
If you're having trouble getting past a boss,

489
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
it might be a good idea to explore and see what you can find.

490
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
For example, if you defeat Blackjaw the Remnant,

491
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
you'll gain a permanent increase to fire resistance.

492
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
One of the most important finds are spirit bonuses.

493
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You can find the first one here in the canopy in Act 1.

494
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Defeat the boss in this area to acquire a permanent addition of spirit.

495
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The permanent buffs you gain from spirit are very powerful

496
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and every class will find the use for them.

497
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So make sure you hunt down these upgrades.

498
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
There's one in each act.

499
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Now we haven't even talked about the most important element

500
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
of character progression, items.

501
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
That's why we're all here, right?

502
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Items in Path of Exile can be broken down into four rarity groups.

503
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Normal, Magic, Rare and Unique.

504
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
One of the things you're going to want to do as you play through the campaign

505
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
is upgrade the items you find, and you can do that with currency items.

506
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
An orb of transmutation will allow you to upgrade a normal item

507
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
to a magic item with one mod.

508
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You can then apply an orb of augmentation to add a second mod,

509
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
then use a regal orb to add a third mod and upgrade it to a rare.

510
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Finally, you can use some exalted orbs to add more mods to your rare

511
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
to a total of six mods.

512
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
One of the things we think is really important

513
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
is to make these options available to use as you play.

514
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
All the items that add mods are much more common than they were in Path of Exile 1,

515
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
so that you can use them throughout your campaign playthrough.

516
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
We want you to find things on the ground

517
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
that can be crafted into upgrades much more frequently.

518
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
As well as making the drop rates on these items much more common,

519
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
you can also get them by disenchanting unwanted gear at the magic item vendor.

520
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
If you disenchant magic items, you can build up to an orb of transmutation,

521
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and by disenchanting rares, you can build up to regal orbs.

522
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Another important area of crafting items in PoE 2 is sockets.

523
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Some items you find will have sockets that can have ezomite runes placed in them

524
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
that add more mods to the item.

525
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
If I insert this glacial rune into my helmet,

526
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
it will give extra cold resistance.

527
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
This is a great way to solve problems that you have with your build,

528
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
like resistances or damage.

529
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
If you find socketed items that you don't have a use for,

530
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
you can take them to the salvage bench in town

531
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
to work towards an artificer's orb.

532
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
This will allow you to add sockets to your existing items.

533
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Body armors and two-hand weapons can have up to two sockets,

534
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
while the rest of your armor and one-hand weapons can only have one socket.

535
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You can also salvage items with quality

536
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
to create items like armor scraps or whetstones.

537
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
These will allow you to increase the quality of your items for an up to 20% boost.

538
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
If you don't want to disenchant or salvage your items,

539
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
you can always sell them for gold.

540
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Gold can be used to buy items from vendors,

541
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
and we've tried to do a lot to make sure that the items they have for sale are actually useful.

542
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Every time you level up, they get more stock,

543
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
so make sure to check back often.

544
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Other vendors offer a gamble.

545
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Pay a flat amount of gold, and you'll get a random item of a specific type.

546
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
This could be a great way to improve your gear, if you're lucky.

547
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Gold is also used to respec your passive skills.

548
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Take advantage of this system to experiment with your tree and rework it as required.

549
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The other thing you might want to use gold for is the currency exchange.

550
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
This allows you to exchange currency items with other players on an open market,

551
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
in exchange for a small gold fee.

552
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Now, all items in Path of Exile are freely tradable.

553
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We never bind anything to your character, except gold.

554
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Now, most gear in Path of Exile 2 is randomly generated,

555
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
but there's another type that isn't.

556
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Uniques.

557
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
They are especially rare,

558
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
each with a handcrafted set of unusual mods,

559
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
which can dramatically change a character's build.

560
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
They're not just better rare items.

561
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
They can do much stranger things that can fundamentally change your character.

562
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Corpse Wade will make any corpses you run through explode into clouds of poison.

563
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The Sands of Silk is a body armor that changes your dodge roll into a blink,

564
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
morphing you into sand as you teleport past your foes.

565
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And of course, some uniques are just pure hits of dopamine,

566
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
like Quill Rain,

567
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
which just turns your bow attacks into full auto by doubling your attack speed.

568
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Each unique is something that you can build your character around.

569
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We try to make sure that most unique items have a potential use at endgame,

570
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
even if you find them early on.

571
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And as you can see,

572
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
every single unique item comes with custom art to match.

573
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The last character progression system that you can do during the campaign is Ascension.

574
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Starting in Act 2, you will come across Ascension Trials,

575
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
tests that you must complete to unlock your Ascension class.

576
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
We'll explain these trials soon,

577
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
but first let's take a look at what Ascending can do for your character.

578
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Each class has access to three Ascendancy classes,

579
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
but at the start of Early Access, only two per class will be available.

580
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Ascendancy classes are unique to each character class,

581
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
so choose wisely.

582
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
They can drastically affect how you build your character.

583
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
As a sorceress, you could become a Stormweaver,

584
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
a master of the elements.

585
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Tempest Caller causes elemental storms to be summoned

586
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
each time you do a critical hit with a spell.

587
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
With Strike Twice, you can stack two copies of Shock for more damage,

588
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and going deeper into the tree,

589
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
you can make all your damage types apply Shock.

590
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Make a Shock build from any skill.

591
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Alternatively, you could become a Chronomancer and command time itself.

592
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
She literally has the ability to stop time with Time Freeze.

593
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Not only that,

594
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
but she has many other time manipulation abilities.

595
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Using Temporal Rift,

596
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
she can teleport back to a previous location,

597
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
resetting her life and mana back to what it was.

598
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Or with Time Snap,

599
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
she can reset all her cooldowns

600
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and cast all her spells again.

601
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
On the Warrior,

602
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
you can choose between the Warbringer or the Titan.

603
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
The Warbringer channels the might of his ancestors

604
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
to gain tremendous power.

605
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Using Answered Call,

606
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
you can summon Ancestral Spirits linked to each of your totems.

607
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
With Jade Heritage,

608
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
you can encase your body in a protective layer

609
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
that absorbs all damage until it breaks.

610
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Warcaller's Bellow allows you to explode the corpses of your enemies.

611
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And with Great Wolf's Howl,

612
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
you can ignore the cooldowns of your Warcries.

613
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Let all that anger out.

614
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
The Titan class is all about hitting big.

615
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
With Earthbreaker,

616
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
every slam is a chance to create an aftershock.

617
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
With Crushing Impacts,

618
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
every hit becomes a crushing blow,

619
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
which will allow you to stun your enemies with ease.

620
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
With Surprising Strength,

621
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
you can take advantage of stunned enemies

622
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
to deal 40% more damage.

623
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
As a Ranger,

624
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
you might choose to be a Deadeye,

625
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
an expert markswoman who can take down foes with style.

626
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
With endless munitions,

627
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
every attack gains an extra projectile.

628
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
With Gathering Winds,

629
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
she gains a small increase to movement speed with every attack.

630
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But be careful,

631
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
she loses them when getting hit.

632
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
With Eagle Eyes,

633
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
she will never miss,

634
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
allowing you to stop wasting all those passer points on accuracy.

635
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Alternatively,

636
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
you could become a Pathfinder,

637
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
the master of flasks and poison.

638
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
She can choose from one of several throwable concoctions,

639
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
allowing her to spend her flask charges

640
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
to throw explosive bottles

641
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
that deal various types of damage.

642
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
A Bleeding Concoction will make your enemies bleed,

643
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
while a fulminating one can shock your enemies,

644
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
allowing you to do extra damage.

645
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Contagious Contamination allows her to spread poisons between her foes,

646
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
while Overwhelming Toxicity doubles the number of stacks

647
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
they can be infected by.

648
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Running Assault allows her to move much more quickly while firing,

649
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
while Relentless Pursuit makes her totally immune

650
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
to being slowed by enemies.

651
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The Witch can ascend into the Infernalist or the Blood Mage.

652
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
As an Infernalist,

653
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
she can summon a loyal Hellhound companion.

654
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The Hellhound sets enemies on fire,

655
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
as well as taking a percentage of the damage

656
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
if the Infernalist gets hit.

657
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
With Pyromantic Pact,

658
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
you can turn your mana into Infernal Flame.

659
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
As you cast more spells,

660
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
the Flame builds up,

661
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
and if it overflows,

662
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
you'll take damage.

663
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Using Bringer of Flame,

664
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
you'll want to make sure you keep the flames topped up.

665
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
While your Infernal Flame is above 30%,

666
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
all damage from you and your minions will ignite enemies.

667
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
She can also transform into a literal demon.

668
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
While in demon form,

669
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
she takes an increasing amount of damage,

670
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
but her cast speed and damage increase rapidly as well.

671
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So if you're planning on transforming into a demon,

672
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
make sure you stack a lot of life recovery.

673
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
She can also become a Blood Mage,

674
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
a master of life and energy.

675
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
All Blood Mages must pay the price

676
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
of making skills cost life as well as mana,

677
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
but in exchange,

678
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
every monster they kill will drop life remnants,

679
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
which allow them to quickly gain back that life.

680
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
With Crimson Power,

681
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
she can gain large amounts of extra life,

682
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and with Vitality Siphon,

683
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
she can use her spells to leech life back as well.

684
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Once you've got a significant amount of life,

685
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
you can use Gore Spike

686
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
to make your critical hits deal incredible amounts of damage.

687
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
A monk who is in tune with the elements

688
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
might become an invoker.

689
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
With elemental expression,

690
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the invoker will create waves of elemental power

691
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
each time he does a critical strike.

692
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
With Faith as a Choice,

693
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
you gain the ability to meditate,

694
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
allowing you to double your energy shield.

695
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Choose between I am the Blizzard or I am the Thunder

696
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
to specialize in Cold or Lightning.

697
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And I Shall Rage will lay to turn into an unbound avatar.

698
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Each time you apply a status ailment to an enemy,

699
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
you gain unbound fury.

700
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
When you have enough,

701
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
transform into an avatar

702
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
to deal way more damage

703
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and inflict even more elemental ailments.

704
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Some monks choose to reach into the darkness instead.

705
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The Acolyte of Chayula

706
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
can exchange their mastery of spirit for darkness,

707
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
a resource that can be utilized

708
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
to both absorb and deal damage.

709
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The Shroud of Darkness will protect you

710
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
from all damage incoming,

711
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
but if you take grasp of the void,

712
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
you will deal extra chaos damage

713
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
from all the darkness you have.

714
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Their Dark Pact offers greatly increased resistances

715
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
to chaos damage

716
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and can allow their mana leech

717
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
to not only happen instantly,

718
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
but apply to their energy shield as well.

719
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Another node you can take is Waking Dream,

720
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
which allows you to see into the domain

721
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
of the Breach Demons.

722
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
There you will see the Flames of Chayula

723
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
that can be taken to gain life,

724
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
mana and damage.

725
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The Mercenary has a job to do,

726
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
but which job suits you?

727
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You might choose to become a Witch Hunter.

728
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Obsessive Rituals will give you a Sorcery Ward,

729
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
allowing you to defend yourself against elemental hits

730
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
in exchange for less defense against attacks.

731
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
With Zealous Inquisition,

732
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
your enemies have a 10% chance to explode on death.

733
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
The chance has doubled against demons and undead.

734
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
With Judge, Jury and Executioner,

735
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
your initial hit against enemies

736
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
can deal up to 30% of their life in damage,

737
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
if you're lucky.

738
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
This is great for hunting powerful bosses.

739
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And with Witch Bane,

740
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
you can break your enemies' concentration,

741
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
preventing them from casting spells

742
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
as often as they would usually do.

743
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You could also choose to become a Gemling Legionnaire,

744
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
enhancing your abilities

745
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
by embedding gems directly in your flesh.

746
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Integrated efficiency will give you extra skill slots,

747
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Thermatological Infusion gives you extra maximum resistances

748
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
as you socket more and more support gems.

749
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Adaptive Capability allows you to use any color of gem

750
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
without worrying about attributes,

751
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
while Crystalline Potential adds extra quality bonuses

752
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
to every gem socketed into your character.

753
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So those are the Ascendancy classes

754
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
for the start of Early Access.

755
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But one thing we haven't talked about yet

756
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
is how you ascend in the first place.

757
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Ascension in Path of Exile 2

758
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
requires completion of one of the Great Trials,

759
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
which you'll find as you progress through the campaign.

760
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Each one is associated with one of the major cultures of Rhaeclast.

761
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Located in the Vasteri Plains are the Marraketh,

762
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
a culture of rich tales and brutal traditions

763
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
who must do whatever it takes to survive in the desert.

764
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
The highest position in Marraketh culture is a Sekima,

765
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and it is not a title given freely.

766
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
All aspirants must complete the Trial of the Sekimas,

767
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
a gruelling gauntlet that will test their strength,

768
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
will, cunning and patience.

769
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
To enter, a warrior of the Marraketh must prove their worth

770
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
by trapping the soul of a djinn in a coin,

771
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
and you are no different.

772
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Once you have earned your coin,

773
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
it may be placed in the Relic Altar to begin the Trial.

774
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:34,000
In the Trial of the Sekimas, each room has its own challenges to overcome.

775
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
In this room, each rare monster you kill will send its blood

776
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
to the chalice in the center of the room.

777
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Once the chalice is filled, you will be able to proceed.

778
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
While fighting monsters in the Trial, you will need to be very careful.

779
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Each hit will not only hurt you, but will damage your honor.

780
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The monsters are well telegraphed, so that you can avoid their attacks,

781
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
but if you run out of honor, you will fail the Trial

782
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
and need to find another coin in order to try again.

783
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It is a good idea to make sure that you are well prepared

784
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
before challenging the Trial of the Sekimas.

785
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
After each room, you will be rewarded.

786
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
In this case, you have been given a key

787
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
that can be used to unlock chests later in the Trial.

788
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Once you have claimed your reward,

789
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
you will be shown a map of the rest of the floor

790
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
and may choose how you wish to proceed.

791
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Which challenges would you like to face,

792
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
and which rewards do you want to claim?

793
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Some rooms are more dangerous,

794
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
afflicting you with debuffs that will persist for the entire Trial.

795
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
For example, entering this room will afflict you with spiked shells,

796
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
that will cause all monsters in the rest of the Trial

797
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
to have 50% increased life.

798
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You will want to take care if you choose such a path.

799
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There are many different challenges and rewards

800
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
as you journey through the Trial.

801
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Deadly traps, waves of monsters,

802
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
and strange artifacts will test your honor.

803
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
As you progress, you'll be able to gain boons from the Djinn,

804
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
which will help you on your journey.

805
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
For example, the Sekima's Cloak will revive you once if you die,

806
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
giving you a second shot at a run.

807
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
One of the rewards you may find is Sacred Water,

808
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
an extremely valuable and treasured resource

809
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
to the Djinn and the Mariketh.

810
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Trading it with the Djinn will allow you to receive many benefits.

811
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You can recover honor, gain additional boons,

812
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
or remove afflictions.

813
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
At the end of the floor, you'll find a powerful boss

814
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
which will truly test your limitations.

815
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
In order to ascend, you will need to defeat him.

816
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Having defeated the boss, you've earned the right to ascend.

817
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
But first, the loot.

818
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The keys you have found may be used to open the various treasures

819
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
in the vault at the end of the floor.

820
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
We only have a single bronze key,

821
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
so we'll just have to open one of these small chests.

822
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
If you want to open the better ones,

823
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
you'll need silver or gold keys.

824
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Let's use the Altar of Ascendancy.

825
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Your first ascension will allow you to pick your class

826
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and grant you two points to use in the tree.

827
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Now, there are more flaws and many more rewards

828
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
that can be found within the Trial of the Sekimus,

829
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
but we'll save that for the section on the endgame.

830
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
For now, let's talk about the second Ascendancy trial,

831
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
the Trial of Chaos.

832
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
In Path of Exile 2, you can choose whichever trial you like

833
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
to earn your ascension.

834
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Each culture on Wraeclast had their own methods to ascend.

835
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
If the Trial of the Sekimus is not your kind of playstyle,

836
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
or you're finding it too difficult, you could try another.

837
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You can gain all your ascension points from just one,

838
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
or mix and match them.

839
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's up to you.

840
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
For early access, we will have two trials as options,

841
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
with a third trial coming later for the full release.

842
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
While exploring the Vaal jungle,

843
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
you'll discover the Temple of Chaos.

844
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Before the Vaal embraced the science of corruption,

845
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
their civilization worshipped Chaos.

846
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
This ancient trial was once used by the Vaal

847
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
to test their high priests.

848
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
A high priest of the Vaal must show willingness

849
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
to risk everything to gain power.

850
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Entry to the trial requires a token from a strange entity

851
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
known only as the Trial Master.

852
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
For those in which he sees potential,

853
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
he shall inscribe an ultimatum.

854
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Many have attempted these trials in search of greatness.

855
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Most have perished.

856
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Will you be able to defy the odds?

857
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Before you begin each chamber,

858
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
the Trial Master will offer you a reward and a choice.

859
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Choose one of three tribulations to affect you

860
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
through the rest of the trial.

861
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
These modifiers might beef up the monsters,

862
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
curse the player,

863
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
or add environmental hazards like turrets or trap runes.

864
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
In this case, we will be picking shocking turrets.

865
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
As you enter the room,

866
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
the Trial Master will fill it with hazards

867
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
to test your commitment.

868
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,000
In this case,

869
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
you must destroy all the monsters that fill the room

870
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
while dealing with the lightning projectiles

871
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
from the shocking turrets.

872
00:46:44,000 --> 00:47:01,000
After each room,

873
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:14,000
you will need to make a choice.

874
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Take the rewards you have earned so far

875
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
or go double or nothing.

876
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Increase your rewards,

877
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
but take on more risk.

878
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Each tribulation you add is minor on its own,

879
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
but they quickly stack on top of each other

880
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and can become overwhelming.

881
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
There are many types of chambers in the Trial.

882
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Each will test your resolve in different ways.

883
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
This one simply requires you survive

884
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
for a certain amount of time.

885
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Another requires you to escort the Stone Idol

886
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,000
through the level

887
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
as elevators full of monsters descend to attack you.

888
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Should you be able to get through the first three chambers,

889
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
you will face your first boss.

890
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
The order of the bosses is random,

891
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and combined with the tribulations you have selected,

892
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
the fight will never feel the same.

893
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
After defeating the boss,

894
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
you may claim your rewards.

895
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Of course there are the items,

896
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
but you also gain the right to ascend.

897
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
If you already did the Trial of the Sekamers,

898
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
then you can claim two more points

899
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
to add to your ascendancy class.

900
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Now it's possible to go much deeper.

901
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
There are more bosses,

902
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
rewards and risks to take,

903
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
but we'll talk more about that

904
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
when we get to Endgame.

905
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So how about we talk about that now?

906
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So far, we've only been showing you

907
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
footage from the campaign,

908
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
but some people would argue that the endgame

909
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
is where the game truly begins.

910
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Something that happens almost every time

911
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a new action RPG launches is people saying,

912
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
there isn't enough endgame content.

913
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Well, we want to make sure that in PoE 2,

914
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
people don't feel that way,

915
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and we actually only changed our development priority

916
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
for this recently.

917
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
The first three acts of PoE 2 already take around 25 hours

918
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
to complete if you're a new player.

919
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
This is already a pretty significant campaign.

920
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
On the other hand,

921
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
people spend hundreds of hours in Endgame each league.

922
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
We realized that finishing the rest of the campaign

923
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
for early access was actually a bad idea.

924
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Instead of having acts 4 to 6 in early access,

925
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
we could concentrate on Endgame and make that great.

926
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
For new players,

927
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
a 25-hour campaign is already a huge game

928
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
with lots of content.

929
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
But for existing action RPG players,

930
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
what you mostly care about

931
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
is all the endgame challenges to overcome.

932
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So several months ago,

933
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
we switched the entire development team's focus

934
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
over to making endgame content.

935
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
At the start of early access,

936
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
there'll be 50 bosses and around 400 monster types.

937
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But the great thing is

938
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
that the rest of the game is like 80% there.

939
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
We'll be adding content to roughly double the size of the game

940
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
during early access and into release.

941
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Now, in order to make the endgame happen

942
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
at the same character level

943
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
as what it would be after we added the rest of the acts,

944
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
we've added a second difficulty level called Cruel,

945
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
where you repeat the campaign

946
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
with all the monsters and bosses leveled up.

947
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And of course, new rewards.

948
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
You can kind of think of it as like a new game plus.

949
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
It's also a lot faster to get through the content

950
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
the second time as your clear speed increases.

951
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
That will take you to around level 65,

952
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,000
where the endgame begins.

953
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Once we add the remaining three acts,

954
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
we'll be removing Cruel difficulty,

955
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
so you'll progress straight from the end of Act 6

956
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
to endgame.

957
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But what is the endgame?

958
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
To explain that, I'll hand over to Mark.

959
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
He can tell you all about it.

960
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Hi, I'm Mark Roberts,

961
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
game director on Path of Exile 2.

962
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Well, one thing that Path of Exile is known for

963
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
is having a lot of distinct endgame content

964
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
to choose between.

965
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Each endgame mechanic needs to have its own

966
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
progression system, areas, bosses, rewards,

967
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
and player power that can only be gained from that content.

968
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
We are going to be adding a lot more over time,

969
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
but for Path of Exile 2, we decided to start with

970
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
seven distinct systems you can progress through.

971
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
This is the Atlas,

972
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and it serves as the core of the endgame for Path of Exile 2.

973
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It's infinite and expands in all directions.

974
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Now, we are not going to spoil the plot too much here,

975
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
but corruption from the beast has blighted the land,

976
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and your objective is to help fight it.

977
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
In the center of the Atlas, you will find the Ziggurat,

978
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
a temple in which the Val research the fundamentals of space and time.

979
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Here, we can open portals to nearby locations,

980
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and begin cleansing corruption and finding resources.

981
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
In order to power the portal device, we will need waystones.

982
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Each waystone has a tier,

983
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
which will determine the level of the monsters that you will face.

984
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
To go to an area, simply click one that is adjacent to an area

985
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
that you have already completed.

986
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Insert the waystone and click Traverse.

987
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Portals will open, allowing you and your party

988
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
to travel to the area you have selected.

989
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
All the areas in the endgame feel distinct

990
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
from the locations in the campaign,

991
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
and we have dialed the randomization up to 11.

992
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
The monster packs you will face in each map are totally random,

993
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
and the combination of them can lead

994
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
to some very interesting combat situations.

995
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
There are over 400 monster types in early access,

996
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
and they have a lot of varied and interesting abilities.

997
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Depending on which combinations you face,

998
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
you might find some serious challenges.

999
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
In order to cleanse the corruption from the area,

1000
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
you will need to defeat all the powerful rare

1001
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
and unique enemies in it.

1002
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Once you have done that,

1003
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
the area will be marked as completed,

1004
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and you will be able to travel past it

1005
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
to progress deeper into the world.

1006
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
If you die, then the map can no longer be run,

1007
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
and you will have to find another way around

1008
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
to get to the areas behind it.

1009
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
There are also all kinds of other random encounters

1010
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
you might run into as you play maps.

1011
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
One such encounter are Precursor Artifacts.

1012
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
These are ancient, corrupting monuments

1013
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
that irradiate the monsters around them.

1014
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
The monsters that feed off the corruption

1015
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
are drawn to their power.

1016
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
If you defeat the monsters and cleanse the artifact,

1017
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
you will get a powerful temporary buff.

1018
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Some of the buffs make you faster,

1019
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
others rain lightning or fire around you,

1020
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and some even give you increased experience

1021
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
or help you find better items.

1022
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You can also find Strongboxes.

1023
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
These enigmatic chests guard piles of treasure,

1024
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
but are always a trap.

1025
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Monsters lie in wait to attack you

1026
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
the moment you open it,

1027
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
and the boxes often have mechanisms

1028
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
to unleash powerful spells or dangerous debuffs.

1029
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
There are different types of Strongboxes

1030
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
containing different items,

1031
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
and you can even use your currency items

1032
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
to craft them on the fly,

1033
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
so you can optimize the content.

1034
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But be careful of opening one you can't handle.

1035
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Sometimes you'll discover monsters frozen in essences,

1036
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
solidified crystalline corruption.

1037
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
These dangerous monsters can be broken free.

1038
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
If you defeat them,

1039
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
the essence they drop can be used

1040
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
to upgrade normal items to magic items

1041
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
with a guaranteed mod from a category.

1042
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
For example,

1043
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
we could use this one on some boats

1044
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
to ensure a movement speed mod.

1045
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Rarely, essences will also drop

1046
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
that allow you to upgrade magics to rares,

1047
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
adding the guaranteed mod.

1048
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:55,000
This is incredibly powerful,

1049
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
since it allows you to get a second deterministic mod

1050
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
in your crafting projects.

1051
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Combining these with the currencies

1052
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
that are commonly found in Rayclassed

1053
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
for modifying items,

1054
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
and we can get a very nice pair of boots indeed.

1055
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Waystones, like all items,

1056
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
can also be crafted using your currency items.

1057
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Adding prefix mods will improve the rewards,

1058
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
while suffix mods increase danger.

1059
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
The more dangerous a map is,

1060
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
the more waystones will drop.

1061
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Adding mods to your waystones is key

1062
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
to progressing to higher tiers

1063
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
and sustaining them,

1064
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
but it will require you

1065
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
to take on larger challenges.

1066
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
There are a variety of factors

1067
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
you have to consider

1068
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
when crafting your waystones.

1069
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Some maps will have higher density,

1070
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
some lower,

1071
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
some have more magic and rare chests,

1072
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
or monsters,

1073
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
some are more linear,

1074
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and others more open.

1075
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Make sure you explore

1076
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
and think about what makes certain maps good

1077
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
if you want to maximize your returns.

1078
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
As you cleanse corruption

1079
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
from higher and higher tiers of the Atlas,

1080
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
you will gain points

1081
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
that you can spend in the Atlas tree.

1082
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
This tree allows you to juice the danger

1083
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
and rewards of all areas in the endgame.

1084
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
You could increase the number of monsters,

1085
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
the number of rares,

1086
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
the number of precursor artifacts or strongboxes,

1087
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
even the quantity of item drops.

1088
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
As you explore the endgame world map,

1089
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
you'll notice various different biomes,

1090
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
from snow-capped mountains

1091
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
to dense jungle valleys.

1092
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Most maps are restricted to certain biomes.

1093
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
As you continue to explore deeper into the Atlas,

1094
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
there are all sorts of things to discover.

1095
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
These cities are constructed

1096
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
by different peoples of Rhaeclast,

1097
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
and have specific items that can be found there.

1098
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
These strange structures marked on the map

1099
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
don't appear to do anything for now.

1100
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Perhaps you'll work out how to use them later.

1101
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You might find unique maps

1102
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
like Untainted Paradise,

1103
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
an undisturbed island full of beasts

1104
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
that give an extreme amount of experience.

1105
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
You may even find a lonely man

1106
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
just enjoying his retirement

1107
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
who will give you a unique item for free.

1108
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
In addition, you can find special areas

1109
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
that would make a good spot to set up camp.

1110
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Clear these areas of their hostile inhabitants,

1111
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
and you'll be able to claim them as your own hideout.

1112
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
You can decorate your hideout as you see fit,

1113
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and invite various NPCs to join you there

1114
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
to create your own personal base of operations.

1115
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
A great tool for exploration are towers.

1116
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
These mysterious precursor constructs

1117
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
are dotted around the Atlas.

1118
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Completing the tower will reveal a large area around it,

1119
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
allowing you to scout out your next challenge.

1120
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
There are lots of things to find,

1121
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,000
so keep looking.

1122
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Some sections of your Atlas

1123
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
are influenced by corruption.

1124
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
This adds extra modifiers to the maps in the region,

1125
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
increasing difficulty and rewards.

1126
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Here, slaying monsters in close proximity to each other

1127
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
will cause the vestiges of corruption within them

1128
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
to merge together,

1129
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
forming powerful and grotesque abominations.

1130
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
You may have noticed while looking at the Atlas

1131
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
that some of the areas have these icons above them.

1132
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The icon indicates that the area contains some kind of special encounter.

1133
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
This icon indicates that the area has a powerful boss.

1134
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Because only one in four maps contain a map boss,

1135
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
we are able to make them very powerful and very rewarding.

1136
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
These bosses come from the campaign,

1137
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
but have had their difficulty increased

1138
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
with changes to AI and some of their abilities.

1139
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It's worth noting that because you can see where the bosses are,

1140
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
you can choose to take them on or avoid them.

1141
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
If you do choose to hunt bosses though,

1142
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
then you will be rewarded with special points

1143
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
for the boss hunting section of the Atlas skill tree.

1144
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
The points here will allow you to specialise in boss killing,

1145
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
giving you much greater rewards for defeating them.

1146
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
For each different type of content in the endgame,

1147
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
we are adding specialised trees

1148
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
in order to make it so you don't feel the need

1149
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
to respec your points

1150
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
when you change between different types of content.

1151
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
We will be showing you seven of these

1152
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
by the end of this presentation,

1153
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
so there is still a lot more to come.

1154
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Bosses are not the only icon you will see on the Atlas.

1155
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Let's take a look at one of the endgame systems,

1156
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Breach.

1157
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
If you played PoE 1,

1158
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
you might be familiar with Breach.

1159
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
For PoE 2,

1160
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
we have created sequels to several PoE 1 leagues.

1161
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
While the mechanic is familiar,

1162
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
the monsters, bosses, rewards,

1163
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
and progression are all new.

1164
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
A Breach is a tear in the fabric of reality.

1165
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Opening it will allow you to see the demons

1166
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
and otherworldly monstrosities

1167
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
that lie in wait on this other plane of existence.

1168
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
By engaging with a Breach,

1169
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
you'll create a bridge between their world and Rayclast.

1170
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
In order to keep the Breach open,

1171
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
you will need to kill the demons that pour forth.

1172
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The faster you can kill the monsters,

1173
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
the more monsters you will fight,

1174
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
and the more loot you will find.

1175
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
You can also find clasped hands

1176
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
that will open and drop more items

1177
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
if you run over them.

1178
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
These can be a good boost to the rewards of the Breach,

1179
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
so keep an eye on them.

1180
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
One of the rewards that you may find

1181
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
while fighting monsters from Breach are tablets.

1182
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Tablets are special items

1183
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
that can be used with Precursor Towers

1184
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
to add more encounters to the Atlas.

1185
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Breaches will drop Breach tablets.

1186
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Clicking on a completed tower

1187
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
will allow you to consume the tablet

1188
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
to add more breaches to areas

1189
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
within range of the tower.

1190
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
This makes all the content in the Atlas self-sustaining.

1191
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Want to do more breaches?

1192
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Find the tablets, add them to your towers,

1193
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
get more breaches, getting more tablets.

1194
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Soon, your Atlas will be covered in otherworldly domains.

1195
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
In addition, like all items in PoE,

1196
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
you can craft them.

1197
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Use your currency to add mods to your tablets,

1198
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
allowing you to upgrade all the Breaches in range.

1199
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Tablets can have up to two mods.

1200
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
These mods do things like adding extra rare monsters,

1201
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
extra clasped hands,

1202
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
or even mods to density of Breaches,

1203
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
allowing you to keep them open longer.

1204
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Often, you will find multiple towers near to each other

1205
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
with overlapping areas of effect.

1206
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
This can allow you to really juice the mechanic

1207
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
by stacking the mods from multiple tablets.

1208
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
In your fight to hold the Breach demons at bay,

1209
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
you may want to use the powers of their world against them.

1210
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Each endgame mechanic always has player power

1211
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
that can only be gained from that mechanic,

1212
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
and Breach is no different.

1213
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
In Breach, you will find Catalysts,

1214
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
items that can increase the quality of rings and amulets

1215
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
by improving specific mods.

1216
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
You can also find Breach Rings,

1217
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
a special base type that can have its quality improved

1218
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
by Catalysts up to 50%.

1219
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
In this case, you could create a ring with around 170 life.

1220
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Breach Rings can become some of the strongest rings in the game,

1221
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
giving you some good motivation to face the Demon Horns.

1222
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
In addition, each endgame mechanic

1223
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
needs to have a pinnacle endgame encounter.

1224
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
While killing Breach monsters,

1225
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
you may find Breach Splinters.

1226
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Collect enough of these,

1227
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
and you'll be able to create a Breach Stone.

1228
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Using a vile technology called the Realm Gate,

1229
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
you can use your Breach Stone to access their domain

1230
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
and bring the fight to them.

1231
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
In this twisted domain,

1232
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
you will find nothing but a single massive Breach.

1233
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Triggering it will reveal hordes of Breach inhabitants.

1234
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And should you be fast enough,

1235
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
you will be able to fight their leader,

1236
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
zisht,

1237
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
we that are one.

1238
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
We that dreamed,

1239
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
we in nightmare,

1240
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
we that are one.

1241
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Fate relies truth.

1242
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:32,000
This is just one of the pinnacle encounters of PoE 2.

1243
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
We won't be showing the rest of them,

1244
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
so you will have to discover them for yourself.

1245
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
But rest assured,

1246
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
this is some of the hardest content we have ever made.

1247
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
All these encounters have specific uniques,

1248
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
they can only be found from them.

1249
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
But that's not all.

1250
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
We still have the progression system.

1251
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Defeating zisht will give you points to allocate

1252
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
into the Breach section of the Atlas Tree.

1253
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Allocating these points will make Breaches

1254
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
and the Breach Domain even harder,

1255
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
but will give you more rewards.

1256
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
The small nodes will increase the difficulty of the Twisted Domain,

1257
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
while the large nodes have more specific bonuses.

1258
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
For example,

1259
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
this node adds more clasped hands to your Breaches,

1260
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and adds a pack of magic monsters that can guard them.

1261
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Get some more points,

1262
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
and you can allocate Waking Nightmare,

1263
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
which will double the number of splinters you get from clasped hands,

1264
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and inflict you with a mysterious debunk.

1265
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
In order to earn more points,

1266
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
you will need to defeat zisht at a higher difficulty,

1267
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
and some rewards from zisht can only be found

1268
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
by increasing the difficulty of the Twisted Domain

1269
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
above certain thresholds.

1270
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Defeating zisht at difficulty 4 will be a challenge indeed,

1271
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
but there are many more threats in Breach last.

1272
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Ritual altars are sacrificial sites

1273
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
built by the mysterious King in the Mists.

1274
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
If you encounter this symbol on the Atlas,

1275
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
then you know that the area contains ritual altars.

1276
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Ritual altars demand tribute.

1277
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Every monster you slaughter in the circle will feed the altar.

1278
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
After the sacrifice, touch it to begin the ritual.

1279
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
The monsters you just killed will be resurrected

1280
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
by the King of the Mists' dark magic,

1281
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
and you must fight to survive.

1282
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
The tribute you have offered to the altar

1283
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
can be spent to buy powerful items,

1284
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
but they can be expensive.

1285
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:14,000
To gain more tribute,

1286
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
you will want to find more altars.

1287
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Each successive ritual you do within an area

1288
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
will spawn the monsters revived by the previous ones,

1289
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
in addition to the ones you sacrificed next to them.

1290
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
By the end of an area,

1291
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
you will be fighting a truly imposing number of foes,

1292
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
but will have a significant amount of tribute to spend.

1293
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
One of the rewards you can buy with tribute are omens.

1294
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
These are special items that allow for metacrafting.

1295
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Crafting items that affect other crafting items.

1296
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Have an item with good prefixes but bad suffixes?

1297
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
This omen will help you to remove the mods you don't want,

1298
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
while keeping the ones you do.

1299
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
There are a bunch more of these with different effects,

1300
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
but we will leave them for you to discover.

1301
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Now don't forget that Ritual will also drop tablets,

1302
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
which can be used to specialise into getting more rituals.

1303
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
If you want to get to the pinnacle boss of Ritual,

1304
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
then you will probably want to use them.

1305
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
They can also be crafted to grant mods,

1306
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
making your rituals more rewarding.

1307
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
The pinnacle encounter of Ritual is

1308
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
The King in the Mists.

1309
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Feared by the Asmiri people,

1310
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
he is said to have brought eternal darkness to the Wildwood.

1311
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
We won't show the encounter,

1312
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
but just like Breach,

1313
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
there are a range of unique items you can get for defeating him,

1314
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and you will gain points in the Ritual section of the Atlas Tree.

1315
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Some maps have been touched by insanity.

1316
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
A mysterious entity has taken a special interest in you.

1317
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Step through the looking glass,

1318
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
and you will find your nightmares coming to life.

1319
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
When you touch a mirror,

1320
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
the mists of Delirium will spread out across the area,

1321
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
infecting your mind.

1322
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
You must stay within the mist to maintain the nightmare,

1323
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
which is as profitable as it is terrifying.

1324
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Everything you kill will increase the rewards that drop.

1325
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
However, the deeper into the mist you travel,

1326
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
the stronger the monsters are.

1327
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Be careful not to overstay your welcome.

1328
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Rare and unique enemies will become vessels for terrifying demons,

1329
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
who will manifest out of them to unleash powerful attacks on you.

1330
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
The mist also offers a strange crafting material,

1331
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Distilled Emotions.

1332
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
By combining these emotions,

1333
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
you are able to instill your amulet

1334
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
with a notable from the passive skill tree.

1335
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
This is like gaining an extra passive point for free,

1336
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
attached to your gear.

1337
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
They are also particularly great,

1338
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
because you don't have to traverse the tree to get them,

1339
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
allowing you to get off-class bonuses

1340
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
that would normally be much harder to get.

1341
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Distilled Emotions can also be used

1342
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
to instill your endgame maps,

1343
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
applying Delirious to them,

1344
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
and adding additional difficulty and rewards,

1345
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
allowing you to further juice your endgame maps.

1346
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
The tablets you can find from Delirious

1347
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
can be used to further improve it,

1348
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
increase pack size,

1349
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
make the fog dissipate slower,

1350
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
or improve your progress

1351
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
towards the pinnacle encounter of Delirious.

1352
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Speaking of which,

1353
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
every now and then you will find

1354
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Simulacrum Splinters.

1355
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
The mysterious entity will create strange encounters

1356
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
based on warped versions of your own memories.

1357
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Monsters and Simulacrums come in waves

1358
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
that get progressively more difficult.

1359
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
You will receive loot at the end of each wave,

1360
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
and you will have to make the decision to leave now,

1361
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
or continue on,

1362
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
facing up against even tougher foes from the mist.

1363
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
The bosses you will face

1364
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
as you get deeper into a Simulacrum

1365
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
are truly terrifying.

1366
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
If you can complete a Simulacrum,

1367
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
you will gain points for the Delirium section

1368
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
of the Atlas skill tree.

1369
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Next up, we have Expedition.

1370
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Occasionally, while clearing Corruption,

1371
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
you will encounter these Kalgurin settlers.

1372
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The Kalgurins have discovered ancient burial sites

1373
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
with lost varicium artifacts,

1374
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
and they want you to help dig them up

1375
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
with explosives.

1376
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
The Kalgurins have marked the locations

1377
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
where the relics can be found.

1378
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Place explosives as best you can

1379
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
to dig up as many as possible.

1380
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
There is just one problem.

1381
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Corruption has brought the corpses

1382
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
of their ancestors to life,

1383
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
so you might have to do a little clean-up

1384
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
before you can reclaim the artifacts.

1385
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You can also find Remnants,

1386
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
the destruction of which

1387
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
will further anger the restless dead.

1388
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Each one you blow up

1389
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
will make the subsequent monsters

1390
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
more powerful,

1391
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
but also more rewarding.

1392
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Danig,

1393
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Rog,

1394
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Tujan,

1395
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,000
and Gwennon

1396
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
will exchange the artifacts

1397
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
for useful items

1398
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
and runic magic.

1399
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
You can also find tablets

1400
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
to increase the number of expeditions

1401
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and the rewards.

1402
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
This one increases the radius of explosives,

1403
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
while this one increases

1404
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
the number of remnants you will find.

1405
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Eventually, you might discover a logbook.

1406
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
These are special maps

1407
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
full of buried treasure and relics,

1408
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
essentially one giant dig site.

1409
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Here, you can create an extremely long chain of explosives

1410
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
and go through a very high number of remnants,

1411
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,000
but be careful.

1412
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Many remnants have mods

1413
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
that can really brick your build,

1414
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
so you will probably want to avoid these ones.

1415
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
If you add too many remnants,

1416
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
you could easily make the encounter

1417
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
harder than you can handle.

1418
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
There are all sorts of interesting things

1419
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
buried under the ground in logbooks.

1420
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
You might find dripping caves

1421
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
and hidden pirate caches,

1422
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
but the most powerful encounter is Ulroth,

1423
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
the ancient undead commander

1424
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
of the Knights of the Sun.

1425
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Defeating him will grant you unique rewards,

1426
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
as well as points to spend

1427
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
in the expedition section of the Atlas tree.

1428
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
So those are the endgame systems on the Atlas,

1429
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
but we are not done yet.

1430
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
The trials we talked about earlier

1431
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
have much more content

1432
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
when you get to endgame too.

1433
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Just like the other endgame systems,

1434
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
they also have progression mechanics,

1435
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
unique rewards,

1436
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
and player power

1437
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
that can only be gained from them.

1438
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
As you get higher level coins

1439
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
for the trial of the Sekimers,

1440
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
you will unlock more floors to explore.

1441
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Each floor has its own challenging brooms

1442
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and a floor boss that you will need to kill.

1443
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
There are four floors in total,

1444
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
leading to another pinnacle boss

1445
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
at the end of the last floor,

1446
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
which can only be accessed at endgame.

1447
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
The trial of the Sekimers

1448
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
is where you'll find duels,

1449
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
which you can socket into your tree.

1450
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
These are like passives

1451
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
that you can craft with your currency items.

1452
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
They can be really powerful,

1453
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
as they allow you to stack modifiers

1454
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
that may not be easily accessible

1455
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
on the tree normally.

1456
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
This duel gives lightning damage

1457
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and shock chance, for example.

1458
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
There are quite a few duel sockets

1459
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
on the tree,

1460
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
so it's possible to gain a lot of power here.

1461
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There are also other types of duels

1462
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
that don't provide any bonuses themselves,

1463
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
but affect other passives surrounding them.

1464
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
This duel increases the effect

1465
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
of small nodes and radius by 25%.

1466
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
With careful placement in the tree,

1467
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
you could get a significant amount of power from it.

1468
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
There are also unique duels available

1469
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
with very interesting effects,

1470
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
but you will have to find those for yourself.

1471
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
In order to push further into the trial

1472
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and uncover the secrets of the Marakev,

1473
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
you will want to take advantage

1474
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
of its progression system, relics.

1475
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Relics are items that can be placed

1476
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
in the Relic Altar as you start the trial.

1477
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
They give special bonuses that affect the trial,

1478
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
making it easier and increasing its rewards.

1479
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Of course, you can craft these

1480
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
with your currency items,

1481
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
making them even stronger.

1482
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
If you can complete the entire trial,

1483
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
overcoming all four flaws,

1484
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
the final boss will reward you

1485
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
with one of many unique relics.

1486
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
These relics will be consumed

1487
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
when used on your next run,

1488
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
but can reward you with unique

1489
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
and powerful items.

1490
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
For example, this is the Last Flame.

1491
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
If you use it,

1492
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
you will have only one honor

1493
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
for the entire trial,

1494
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
so you will need to do

1495
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
a completely hitless run.

1496
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
The Trial of Chaos

1497
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
also extends into the endgame.

1498
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
As you gain inscribed ultimatums

1499
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
of higher and higher levels,

1500
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
the number of chambers

1501
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
that you can go through increases.

1502
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
In true Vaal style,

1503
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
this allows you to take even more risks

1504
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
for even more rewards.

1505
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
At endgame, you can progress

1506
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
through up to 10 chambers

1507
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
with three bosses on a single run,

1508
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
stacking 10 tribulations

1509
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
on top of each other

1510
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
will make this a significant challenge,

1511
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
but it's worth it.

1512
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
The Trial Master will tempt you

1513
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
with items of the Vaal Empire,

1514
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
such as Vaal Orbs.

1515
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Vaal Orbs are powerful crafting items

1516
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
that corrupt your gear

1517
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
with random mysterious outcomes.

1518
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Corruption prevents an item

1519
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
from being modified further,

1520
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
so it has to be the last step

1521
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
of your craft,

1522
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
but it's also the most impactful one.

1523
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
For example,

1524
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
if you use one on your body armor,

1525
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
it might add a new powerful enchantment,

1526
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
or it might re-roll up to half

1527
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
of its modifiers.

1528
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Vaal Orbs also have the ability

1529
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
to add a socket,

1530
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
allowing you to bypass

1531
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
the normal restriction

1532
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
of how many sockets an item can have.

1533
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
A body armor could get up

1534
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
to three sockets this way,

1535
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
allowing for a significant number of mods.

1536
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Vaal Orbs can even modify uniques.

1537
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Adding enchantments or sockets to uniques

1538
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
can make them incredibly powerful,

1539
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
but there is a good chance

1540
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
that you will break them as well.

1541
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
The Trial Master will also

1542
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
occasionally offer you Soul Cores.

1543
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Originally formed by Chaos,

1544
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
the Vaal sought to replicate Soul Cores

1545
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
through human sacrifice rituals

1546
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
and blood magic to power their civilization.

1547
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Soul Cores are powerful socketable items,

1548
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
with mods that cannot be obtained

1549
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
from regular runes.

1550
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Like all endgame content,

1551
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
there is of course a pinnacle boss.

1552
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The final chamber will drop keys

1553
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
to this mysterious door.

1554
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Some say this is where

1555
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
the Trial Master himself resides.

1556
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Perhaps you are willing

1557
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
to take the risk to find out.

1558
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Had enough yet?

1559
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Because there is still just one more thing.

1560
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
The most difficult content

1561
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
in Path of Exile 2.

1562
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
While mapping,

1563
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
you might come across this fortress

1564
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
that has emerged from underground,

1565
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
surrounded by an enormous maze

1566
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
riddled with danger.

1567
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Is the maze preventing something

1568
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,000
from getting in?

1569
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Or something getting out?

1570
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
This fortress is of ancient origin

1571
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
and its construction has similarities

1572
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
to the towers and tablets

1573
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
that you have been using

1574
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
on your journey through the endgame.

1575
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
It is clear from the entrance

1576
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
that there are three keys required to enter.

1577
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Local factions are vying

1578
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
for access to the fortress

1579
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
in order to seize the power

1580
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
they believe will be inside.

1581
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Each of the faction's leaders

1582
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
have managed to get their hands

1583
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
on one of the keys,

1584
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
so you will need to defeat them.

1585
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Each faction is led by an Uber Act boss.

1586
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
You can see one of them

1587
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
inhabiting the city,

1588
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
but in order to fight him,

1589
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
you will first need to defeat

1590
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
their two lieutenants

1591
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
in the adjacent zones.

1592
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Be careful.

1593
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
If you fail against

1594
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
either of the lieutenants

1595
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
or to kill the leader,

1596
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,000
they will move on

1597
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
and you will need to find them again.

1598
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Kill all the Uber bosses

1599
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
and you will gain access

1600
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,000
to the fortress.

1601
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
We aren't going to spoil it

1602
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
as we can't wait to see you guys

1603
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
attempt it for the first time.

1604
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
But is there a tree you get points in

1605
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
after killing it?

1606
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Of course there is.

1607
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
This is Path of Exile.

1608
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
There is always another tree.

1609
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So these are your challenges

1610
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
for PoE 2.

1611
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,000
As you can see,

1612
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
this project is crazy huge.

1613
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Way bigger than even we expected

1614
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
when we started out.

1615
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
But how do you gain access?

1616
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Well, during early access,

1617
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
you'll need a key to get in.

1618
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
To thank our existing PoE supporters

1619
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
who have spent more than $480 US dollars,

1620
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
we'll be giving you guys a key

1621
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
for the PC version for free.

1622
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Anyone else who wants one

1623
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
can get one by purchasing

1624
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
one of the new early access supporter packs

1625
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
that have just been released to the store.

1626
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
If you just want early access to PoE 2,

1627
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
then you can get a key

1628
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
in the $30 US dollar early access pack.

1629
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
The pack also comes with $30 of points

1630
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
to spend in the MTX store.

1631
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
But we also have a variety

1632
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
of other supporter packs

1633
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
filled with exclusive microtransactions,

1634
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
points to spend in the store,

1635
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
and even physical items.

1636
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
The cosmetics can be used right now

1637
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
in PoE 1 and in Path of Exile 2

1638
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
when early access starts.

1639
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Most of this footage has been recorded

1640
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
in Path of Exile 1,

1641
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
since that's where you can use them immediately.

1642
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
The Lord of Ogham supporter pack

1643
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
contains a cosmetic armor set

1644
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
befitting of the Count of Ogham himself.

1645
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
There is also a matching back attachment

1646
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
which has an alternate variant

1647
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
depicting the influence of corruption.

1648
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Also in this pack,

1649
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
you can find a portal

1650
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
formed of the rusted armor

1651
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
of the fallen soldiers

1652
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
in the Red Veil of Ogham,

1653
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
and the offspring of a vicious crowbell boss

1654
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
found in the hunting grounds.

1655
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
This one doesn't look so vicious though.

1656
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
On top of that,

1657
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
you'll receive the Iron Counts Zwei-Hander

1658
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
to apply to your one-handed

1659
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
or two-handed swords.

1660
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
For those who are wanting

1661
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
to decorate your hideouts

1662
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
with fond memories and tales

1663
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
of Path of Exile's history,

1664
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
you will also get a series

1665
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
of hideout statues.

1666
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,000
This pack contains

1667
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
the statue of Hillock.

1668
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
For Path of Exile 1's closed beta,

1669
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
each pack contained

1670
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
a true New Zealand icon,

1671
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,000
the Kiwi.

1672
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Following this tradition,

1673
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
all packs in this series

1674
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
will also contain

1675
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
a new themed Kiwi pet.

1676
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
The pet will loyally

1677
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
follow you into battle,

1678
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,000
but run away

1679
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
at the first sign of trouble.

1680
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Become the ruler of the desert

1681
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
with the King of the Faridans

1682
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
supporter pack.

1683
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Show your mastery

1684
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
of traversing the sands

1685
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
of the Vasteri plains.

1686
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
The body armor will allow you

1687
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
to glide along the ground

1688
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
with ancient sand magic.

1689
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Now, each armor set

1690
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
comes with body armor,

1691
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
boots, gloves, and helmet,

1692
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
but the boots are covered in sand.

1693
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
If you'd prefer to show them off,

1694
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
you can turn the gliding off

1695
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,000
if you want.

1696
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
The accompanying back attachment

1697
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
equips you with two powerful pillars

1698
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
that can control

1699
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and manipulate lightning.

1700
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
They will periodically

1701
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
release their energy

1702
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
in a powerful blast

1703
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
while in town

1704
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
and hover in a circle around you,

1705
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
arcing lightning between them

1706
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
forming a barrier of energy.

1707
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Replace the appearance

1708
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
of any bow

1709
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
with the Faridans' glory skin.

1710
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Or replace the appearance

1711
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,000
of a spear

1712
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
with the Tyranny's end spear skin.

1713
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
This spear skin can be applied

1714
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
to staves and war staves

1715
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
in Path of Exile 1.

1716
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
If you want to truly show your worth

1717
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
as a king of the Faridun,

1718
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
then you definitely need

1719
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
your trusty, moving,

1720
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
entire city fortress

1721
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
known as the Dreadnaught

1722
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
to travel across

1723
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
the Vasteri plains.

1724
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
In Path of Exile,

1725
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
you can decorate your hideout

1726
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
however you like,

1727
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
and it's no exception here.

1728
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
It comes with a variety

1729
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
of thematic elements to use,

1730
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
or use decorations

1731
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
from elsewhere in the game.

1732
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Additionally,

1733
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
you will get the Deshret's

1734
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Blessing level-up effect.

1735
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
The King of the Faridun Kiwi Pet.

1736
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
And last but not least,

1737
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
a statue depicting

1738
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
the Varl Oversoul

1739
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
from Path of Exile 1.

1740
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
For those who don't know

1741
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
how supporter packs work,

1742
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:54,000
each pack comes with

1743
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
all of the cosmetics

1744
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
from the previous tier,

1745
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
so you will get all the items

1746
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,000
from the Lord of Ogham

1747
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
supporter pack as well.

1748
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
The Thaumaturge of the Varl

1749
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
supporter pack features

1750
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,000
an armor set

1751
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
and back attachment

1752
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
themed around the Varl

1753
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
and their pursuit of science

1754
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,000
and progress.

1755
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You can find the

1756
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Soulcore weapon effect

1757
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,000
in this pack,

1758
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,000
which causes

1759
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Thaumaturgic energy

1760
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
harnessed from Sacrifice

1761
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
to spill from your weapon.

1762
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
This pack also contains

1763
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Dooyani's Idol.

1764
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It replaces the default

1765
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
appearance of any foci

1766
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
to an ancient relic

1767
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
once used by Dooyani,

1768
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
and this can be applied

1769
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
to shields in Path of Exile 1.

1770
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
That's not the only

1771
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Varl weapon you'll find.

1772
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000

the Wand of the Thaumaturge skin

1774
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
and the Royal Sacrifice dagger skin.

1775
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
You wouldn't think

1776
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
to put sacrificial gems

1777
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
on a Kiwi,

1778
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
but the Varl did.

1779
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Thaumaturge of the Varl

1780
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
supporters will receive

01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000

Kiwi pet

1783
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
and the Statue of Dominus.

1784
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
This is also the first pack

1785
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,000
in the series

1786
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
with a physical item.

1787
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
When purchasing this pack,

1788
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,000
you'll receive

1789
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000

logo t-shirt,

1791
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
but if you don't want one,

1792
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,000
you can opt out

1793
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
and return for additional points

1794
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
to spend in the store.

1795
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Becoming a Warlord

1796
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
of the Kaorui supporter

1797
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:03,000
will grant you

1798
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
an armour set

1799
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
and back attachment

1800
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
adorned in jade carvings

1801
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
and iridescent feathers

1802
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
resembling power.

1803
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Enough to even impress

1804
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
the ancestral gods,

1805
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
specifically Tukuhama,

1806
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
the Kaorui god of war.

1807
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Overkill, you say?

1808
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I think the Kaorui people

1809
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
would disagree.

1810
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Why not drop

1811
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
a gigantic totem

1812
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
on rare enemies you slay

1813
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
to crush them to a pulp?

01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Replace your crafting bench

1815
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,000

1818
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
where Ancestral Chief

1819
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Mata will summon

1820
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
a giant canoe

1821
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
manned by Kaorui warriors

1822
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
to aid in your crafting desires.

1823
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
We must all start somewhere.

1824
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
You'll also get

1825
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
a pair of weapon skins.

1826
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Equip Akoya's

1827
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000

01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
to your one-hand

1829
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
or two-handed axes,

1830
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
or Tukuhama's Crusher

01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
to your one-handed

1832
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
or two-handed maces.

1833
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,000
A true Kaorui warlord

1834
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:58,000
is always accompanied

1835
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
by their trusty Kiwi.

1836
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Equipped with armour

1837
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
and harnessing

1838
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,000
ancestral magic,

1839
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,000
they make the perfect sidekick.

1840
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Once one of the most feared

1841
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
beings in Wraeclast,

1842
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Malachi was slain

1843
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
by a powerful exile.

1844
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
May the statue commemorate

1845
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
the virtue of exile's past,

1846
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
present,

1847
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
and of the future.

1848
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Of course,

1849
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
it's not all about

1850
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,000
dressing up in game.

1851
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You'll want to look good

1852
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,000
in real life too.

1853
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
By becoming a

1854
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000

01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
suspended in divine power.

1870
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Set up your base of operations

1871
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
in the Beacon of Salvation hideout.

1872
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Why restrict yourself

1873
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
to just one island

1874
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
when you can liberate more?

1875
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
The Beacon of Salvation hideout

1876
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
comes equipped

1877
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
with your own collection

of small islands

1879
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
and personal operators

1880
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,000
of boats

1881
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
that you can use

1882
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
to row between them.

1883
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Just walk to the piers,

1884
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
click a boat to enter

1885
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and navigate as you choose.

1886
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Decorate each island

1887
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
as you see fit

1888
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:01,000
to best represent

1889
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
your well-earned hideout.

1890
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Everyone in your hideout

1891
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
can use their own boat.

1892
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Why not have some races?

1893
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
You can also get

1894
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
the Window to Twilight

1895
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,000
portal effect,

1896
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
a beautiful mosaic

1897
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:12,000
piece of art

1898
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
that shatters

1899
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
and reveals a gateway

1900
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
to your desired destination

1901
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
as you approach it.

1902
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
As you walk away,

1903
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
the glass magically reforms

1904
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
back to its original form.

1905
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Rule in style

1906
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
with the Throne of the Ruler

1907
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
map device.

1908
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Sure,

1909
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:26,000
this map device

1910
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
can create portals

1911
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
to endgame maps,

1912
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
but it also comes

1913
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
with a throne

1914
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,000
you can sit on

1915
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
to oversee

1916
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
your growing kingdom.

1917
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Look down

1918
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
on the plebeians

1919
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,000
running your maps.

1920
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Being the Liberator,

1921
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,000
though,

1922
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,000
is not just about

1923
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
sitting in your throne all day.

1924
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
If you do decide

1925
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
to join the fight yourself,

1926
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,000
you can leave

1927
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
a High Priest in charge

1928
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
as your second-in-command.

1929
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Liberator of Rhaeclast supporters

1930
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000

The Light of Divinity

1933
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Scepter skin,

1934
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000

and the Redemption

1938
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Shield skin.

1939
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Once again,

1940
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:02,000
you'll have

1941
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
an accompanying Kiwi

1942
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and of course a statue

1943
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
depicting one of the most

1944
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
iconic events

1945
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
in Rhaeclast's history.

1946
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
The battle between

1947
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
a powerful exile

1948
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:10,000
and Kitava,

1949
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
the Insatiable.

1950
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
With the help of two deities,

1951
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Sin and Innocence,

1952
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
the exile was able

1953
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
to defeat him

1954
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:16,000
once and for all.

1955
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,000
This supporter pack

1956
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000

01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
and lore

1963
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
produced during the long

1964
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
and exciting journey

1965
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
of Path of Exile 2's development.

1966
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And finally,

1967
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Path of Exile has a tradition

1968
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
of letting the community

1969
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
participate in designing

1970
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
game features.

1971
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
For Path of Exile 2,

1972
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,000
we'll be adding

1973
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
the Twilight Order

1974
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
foil reliquary.

1975
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
By becoming a liberator

1976
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
of Rayclass supporter,

1977
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
once Path of Exile 2

1978
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,000
is released,

1979
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
you'll be able to select

1980
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
any unique item

1981
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
you have found

1982
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
and be able to drop it

1983
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,000
from the reliquary.

1984
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Once players have

1985
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
submitted their items,

1986
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
keys to the reliquary

1987
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
will start dropping

1988
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
and other players

1989
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,000
will be able to find

1990
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
foil versions of uniques

1991
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
that you have submitted

1992
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
along with a message

1993
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
for the lucky player.

1994
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,000
The more players

1995
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
submit the same unique,

1996
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
the more chances there will be

1997
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
for the reliquary

1998
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,000
to drop them,

1999
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,000
so choose wisely.

2000
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Now, almost all of these items

2001
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
are available to use

2002
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
in PoE 1 right now.

2003
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
There are a few exceptions

2004
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:13,000
where the item class

2005
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
clearly doesn't exist,

2006
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
such as crossbows or flails,

2007
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
and there are also

2008
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
a few microtransactions

2009
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,000
on weapon types

2010
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
that are unavailable

2011
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
in PoE 2 at the start

2012
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
of early access.

2013
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Once classes that use

2014
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
those weapon types

2015
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,000
are added,

2016
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
those microtransactions

2017
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
will be available to use.

2018
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
If you can't decide

2019
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
which supporter pack

2020
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
to choose yet,

2021
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
you can always start

2022
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:30,000
with the early access

2023
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
supporter pack

2024
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
that just includes a key

2025
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
and some points to spend

2026
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
in the store.

2027
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Then you can upgrade

2028
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
to any of the following tiers

2029
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
at a later date.

2030
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:38,000
These supporter packs

2031
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
will be available for purchase

2032
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
throughout early access.

2033
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
We'd really like to thank you

2034
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
for your ongoing support.

2035
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Without you guys,

2036
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Path of Exile 2

2037
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,000
could not have happened.

2038
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Now, I'm sure you guys

2039
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
have a lot of questions.

2040
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Stick around,

2041
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
because coming up next

2042
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
we have a live Q&A

2043
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
with Ziggy D.

2044
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:18,000
To the post-show discussion

2045
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
and Q&A.

2046
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I hope you all enjoyed

2047
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
what you've seen so far.

2048
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It's been pretty exciting

2049
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
for us here as well

2050
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
as you guys have been

2051
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
inspired already

2052
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
just watching things

2053
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
and already cooking

2054
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
a new ascendancy class.

2055
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Yeah, for sure.

2056
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
You've got to do design

2057
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
whenever you can.

2058
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

2059
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Absolutely.

2060
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
There's been a few

2061
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
fun moments here already.

2062
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
But I'm your host,

2063
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Ziggy D,

2064
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
and I'm joined by

2065
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Jonathan and Mark

2066
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,000
to talk about

2067
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
everything you've seen.

2068
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Honestly, it's so much.

2069
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I mean, we were really keen

2070
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
to make sure

2071
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
that when we went

2072
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:49,000
into early access

2073
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
that people didn't feel

2074
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
like it was just,

2075
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
you know, limping along

2076
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,000
and kind of, you know,

2077
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
just like a minimal amount

2078
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,000
of content.

2079
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
We really wanted to

2080
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
kind of blow people away.

2081
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
So hopefully people feel like,

2082
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
yeah, there is enough content

2083
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
because, yeah,

2084
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
it was certainly a mission

2085
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
to get all that stuff in.

2086
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Yeah, I did come here

2087
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
expecting that there would be,

2088
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:06,000
you know,

2089
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
maybe a basic mapping

2090
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
placeholder endgame

2091
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and your three acts

2092
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
and, you know,

2093
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
the half the classes.

2094
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
But you've made a decision here,

2095
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
clearly,

2096
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,000
that's got to go

2097
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
the core POE player community

2098
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
in mind.

2099
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Absolutely.

2100
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:19,000
So, I mean,

2101
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
we have to make sure,

2102
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
like, I mean, look,

2103
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Path of Exile's endgame

2104
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
is kind of known

2105
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
for the fact

2106
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,000
that you get to choose

2107
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
between different types

2108
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
of content

2109
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and that, like,

2110
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
you know,

2111
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
some people enjoy one thing,

2112
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,000
some people enjoy another.

2113
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And I feel like that choice

2114
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
is like a huge part

2115
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
of what makes it good.

2116
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
So if we didn't have that

2117
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
when we entered endgame,

2118
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:33,000
then I don't think

2119
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
that would be,

2120
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,000
you know,

2121
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,000
like,

2122
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,000
that wouldn't be

2123
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
a Path of Exile endgame.

2124
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:37,000
So that's kind of

2125
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
what we have to make sure of.

2126
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
So we kind of said,

2127
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
okay,

2128
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:41,000
well, like,

2129
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
what is the minimum number

2130
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
of, like,

2131
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
different endgame things

2132
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
you need to be able to have

2133
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,000
in order to be able

2134
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
to actually have a viable

2135
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
endgame that you feel

2136
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
like you get different choices?

2137
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
And that's how we ended up

2138
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
with what we have here.

2139
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I definitely feel like

2140
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
a lot of games nowadays

2141
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
release, you know,

2142
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
and their campaign's intact

2143
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and real good.

2144
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
You get to the endgame

2145
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
and it just falls real flat.

2146
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Yeah.

2147
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And it was certainly

2148
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
a very important moment

2149
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
for us when we were like,

2150
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
hold on,

2151
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
that's the wrong thing to do.

2152
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Like,

2153
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
let's not make the same mistake

2154
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
as everyone else.

2155
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Let's pivot.

2156
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And we actually did that

2157
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
and, like,

2158
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
it made a world of difference

2159
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
and made the game

2160
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
all of a sudden,

2161
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,000
you know,

2162
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
a hundred times bigger

2163
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
with an infinite amount

2164
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,000
of more content, right?

2165
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
It was definitely hard, though,

2166
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,000
because, like,

2167
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
okay,

2168
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
so we're, you know,

2169
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:23,000
we're progressing.

2170
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's like,

2171
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
we would have made it.

2172
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:25,000
We would have gotten,

2173
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,000
you know,

2174
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
all these acts in

2175
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
if we hadn't have changed direction.

2176
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It's like,

2177
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,000
to actually say,

2178
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,000
you know what,

2179
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
we're going to specifically

2180
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
not finish this content

2181
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
we'll be working on,

2182
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,000
you know,

2183
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
that we,

2184
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
you know,

2185
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,000
it's like,

2186
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
pens down everyone.

2187
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
We're stopping work on this.

2188
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,000
We're going to move over to endgame

2189
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
because it's actually more important.

2190
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Like,

2191
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
that was certainly a hard one.

2192
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,000
That would have been

2193
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
some whiplash there,

2194
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I imagine.

2195
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
For sure.

2196
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I mean,

2197
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
it's like suddenly the whole,

2198
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,000
you know,

2199
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
like,

2200
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,000
environment art team,

2201
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,000
it's like,

2202
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
you know,

2203
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,000
they're all just like,

2204
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
whatever you're working on,

2205
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,000
just scrap.

2206
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,000
You know,

2207
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,000
not scrap,

2208
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,000
but,

2209
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
you know,

2210
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,000
just stop it.

2211
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
We're doing something else now.

2212
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Saving clothes,

2213
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:53,000
yeah.

2214
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Especially for a lot of the developers

2215
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
because you've got to also think,

2216
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,000
like,

2217
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
a lot of our developers

2218
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
have just been working on this campaign

2219
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
for,

2220
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
what is it now,

2221
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,000
six years.

2222
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I think it's even longer,

2223
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,000
actually.

2224
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Yeah,

2225
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
it's like,

2226
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
it's just this epic journey

2227
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
whereas none of them,

2228
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:06,000
you know,

2229
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
a lot of these people

2230
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
haven't been working on Path of XL1

2231
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
this whole time.

2232
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,000
So,

2233
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,000
some of us are like,

2234
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
you know,

2235
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
we're just churning out endgame

2236
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
with every league

2237
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and doing all of that

2238
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
but for a lot of these people,

2239
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
a lot of these developers,

2240
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,000
yeah,

2241
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
it was quite jarring to swap over

2242
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
but everyone embraced it,

2243
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,000
you know,

2244
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
we talked about it,

2245
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
everyone was happy about it

2246
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
and stoked about it

2247
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
and it just ended up

2248
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,000
coming out real awesome,

2249
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:26,000
so.

2250
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I think it's landed well

2251
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
and it definitely

2252
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
kind of blew me away

2253
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,000
when you,

2254
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
even before I saw anything,

2255
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
we were in the car

2256
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
on the drive here

2257
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:33,000
and you were just

2258
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
info dumping

2259
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
all of the endgame

2260
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
and you're like,

2261
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,000
oh,

2262
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,000
we got this feature,

2263
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
we got this feature.

2264
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I'm getting dopamine

2265
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
just from hearing about it.

2266
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I haven't even seen anything yet.

2267
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
But do you guys feel like

2268
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
you're competing against yourselves

2269
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
a little bit here

2270
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
because Path of Exile

2271
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
has kind of set the bar,

2272
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
the original game

2273
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:48,000
has set the bar

2274
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
for what is available

2275
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
to endgame

2276
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
in a game like this

2277
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
and it makes,

2278
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
it's not acceptable really

2279
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
to launch with just nothing

2280
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
in terms of endgame now.

2281
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Absolutely.

2282
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I mean,

2283
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
yeah,

2284
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I mean,

2285
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
like if you're not competing

2286
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:01,000
with yourself,

2287
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
then I don't think

2288
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,000
you're going to make

2289
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
good progress,

2290
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:03,000
right?

2291
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
So that's what you

2292
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
really have to do.

2293
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Yeah,

2294
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
but cracking that out

2295
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:07,000
for beta even.

2296
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Absolutely.

2297
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I just think it would not

2298
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
have landed nearly as well

2299
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
without that

2300
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
and I think

2301
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
it's important

2302
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:14,000
that our existing

2303
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Path of Exile 1 community

2304
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
feels like

2305
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
they're also served.

2306
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:17,000
like,

2307
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:17,000
yeah,

2308
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:17,000
sure,

2309
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
we're doing all this

2310
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,000
stuff for new players

2311
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
and that's really important

2312
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
and that'll expand

2313
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,000
the audience

2314
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
but,

2315
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,000
you know,

2316
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
if we launched

2317
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and all the PeeWee 1

2318
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,000
players are unhappy,

2319
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,000
that wouldn't be good.

2320
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,000
So,

2321
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
you know,

2322
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,000
we have to make sure

2323
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
that they also feel

2324
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,000
like,

2325
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,000
you know,

2326
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
they've got a game

2327
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
for both them

2328
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,000
and for all the new

2329
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
players we hope

2330
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
to bring to the genre.

2331
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And you definitely want

2332
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
all those different axes

2333
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:35,000
as well.

2334
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Like,

2335
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:36,000
just having two,

2336
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
right,

2337
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:37,000
you'll get a lot of,

2338
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:38,000
a lot of content

2339
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
can be immediately divisive,

2340
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
right?

2341
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Obviously,

2342
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
that's the nature of it.

2343
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
That's how it goes,

2344
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,000
different players

2345
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
who like different types

2346
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
of content.

2347
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Yeah.

2348
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,000
So,

2349
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
if you're just like,

2350
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
here's your one end game system,

2351
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
well,

2352
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
immediately then there is

2353
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
a portion of players

2354
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:54,000
who are just like,

2355
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I don't want this,

2356
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,000
right?

2357
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And so,

2358
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
having all of these options

2359
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:58,000
is like,

2360
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
ultra key

2361
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
and that is what

2362
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Path of Exile 1

2363
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
has taught us.

2364
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
And again,

2365
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:03,000
it's like,

2366
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I'd say lessons learned,

2367
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:06,000
you know,

2368
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
for the genre

2369
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
and it is expanding

2370
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
in other games and stuff

2371
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,000
but,

2372
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
yeah,

2373
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
certainly as you said,

2374
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
competing with ourselves,

2375
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:12,000
yes,

2376
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
PeeWee 1 has like,

2377
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,000
you know,

2378
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
40 axes,

2379
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
you know,

2380
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:16,000
and we've got,

2381
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
seven really good ones here

2382
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
and obviously more to come

2383
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
but seven is a lot,

2384
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:22,000
mind you.

2385
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Especially when it's all like,

2386
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:25,000
you know,

2387
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
like people have to learn

2388
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,000
a lot of things again.

2389
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
It's going to be very interesting

2390
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
to see how long it takes

2391
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
people to do the kind of

2392
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
difficulty for Pinnacle content.

2393
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Oh,

2394
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,000
yeah,

2395
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,000
yeah.

2396
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,000
It's like,

2397
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
we have to,

2398
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
it's honestly like,

2399
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
we actually don't even really know

2400
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:37,000
because like,

2401
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
you never know what people

2402
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:38,000
are going to find

2403
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
in terms of builds and so on.

2404
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Like,

2405
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I'm hoping that it will take

2406
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
people a while

2407
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
to be able to work it out

2408
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,000
but,

2409
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,000
you know,

2410
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,000
you never know.

2411
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Maybe end of day one

2412
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
people just like,

2413
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:47,000
oh yeah,

2414
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:48,000
easy,

2415
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
no problem,

2416
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:49,000
mate,

2417
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:49,000
you know,

2418
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,000
could be what it's like.

2419
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
A few people that are doing

2420
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,000
that sort of thing,

2421
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I saw like a solid cell phone

2422
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
level 100 in 24 hours

2423
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
or something.

2424
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Jeez,

2425
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
okay,

2426
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
this is where we've got it now,

2427
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:58,000
is it?

2428
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So,

2429
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I imagine there'll be a little bit

2430
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
of a soft reset there for people.

2431
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Yeah,

2432
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:03,000
for sure.

2433
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
A relearning period.

2434
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
There's stuff to learn.

2435
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And I mean,

2436
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
PeeWee 2 has changed a lot

2437
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
over the years,

2438
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
so more than five years

2439
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
of development now

2440
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
and what was that initial pitch

2441
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
when PeeWee 2 was first put forward

2442
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
as to what it's going to be?

2443
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Because it was much smaller

2444
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
in scope originally.

2445
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Yeah,

2446
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:19,000
so when we started

2447
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
it wasn't even a sequel,

2448
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:21,000
it was just,

2449
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:21,000
we're just updating

2450
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
the character rigs

2451
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
and over time

2452
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
it kind of feature creeped

2453
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
into a proper sequel.

2454
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
But the thing that we were saying

2455
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
is whenever we were talking about it,

2456
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
and I guess this is the main thing,

2457
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
is that we're like,

2458
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:31,000
okay,

2459
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
when we make an area here,

2460
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:34,000
it needs to be

2461
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
that there's like a theme for it

2462
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,000
that feels unique

2463
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
from everything else.

2464
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
We're not going to just like

2465
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
have recycled stuff

2466
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
like within the campaign

2467
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:40,000
that just feels like,

2468
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:40,000
oh,

2469
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
you know,

2470
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:41,000
we just took this area

2471
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
and modified it slightly.

2472
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You know,

2473
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
each one's got to have its own stuff.

2474
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:44,000
It's got to have monsters

2475
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
that were like carefully thought about

2476
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000
that like,

2477
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000
you know,

2478
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
fit in with the world

2479
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
and it's got to have bosses

2480
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
that are actually like

2481
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
good tier quality,

2482
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,000
you know,

2483
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
and every area is going to have one.

2484
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And so those decisions

2485
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
have kind of been things

2486
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
that have meant that

2487
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
like they really raised

2488
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
the quality bar

2489
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
to a level that took us

2490
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,000
way longer

2491
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
than we even really expected.

2492
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Like those things there,

2493
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:07,000
just like they,

2494
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
it's huge, right?

2495
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Like honestly,

2496
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I feel like we underestimated

2497
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
significantly what it would take

2498
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
to deliver that level of quality.

2499
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I remember really early on

2500
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
a battle I fought for,

2501
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
and I mean like way back,

2502
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
was like,

2503
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
if you think back to say Diablo 2,

2504
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
which obviously still holds

2505
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
a lot of,

2506
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:23,000
you know,

2507
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
power in terms of

2508
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
design motivations

2509
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
and philosophy

2510
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and stuff within the company,

2511
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:29,000
you get things like

2512
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
the super uniques

2513
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
and POE 1 did them

2514
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
and it's just like,

2515
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,000
here's a boss

2516
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
with one or two skills.

2517
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
And I remember very,

2518
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
very,

2519
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
very early on in POE 2,

2520
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I'm like,

2521
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I want every single boss

2522
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
to be memorable

2523
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:42,000
and a thing.

2524
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I don't want a unique monster

2525
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
that's just like,

2526
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
dies in two seconds

2527
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and uses heavy strike

2528
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
and has a fancy name.

2529
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
And I remember,

2530
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I even got some push,

2531
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
poor Caleb.

2532
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I remember getting some

2533
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
pushback at the time

2534
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
and thinking like,

2535
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,000
you know,

2536
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I love the bosses,

2537
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
my favorite part of everything.

2538
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And so I was just like,

2539
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,000
man,

2540
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I really,

2541
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I don't want this.

2542
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
This is just terrible.

2543
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,000
And,

2544
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
but of course,

2545
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
that decision,

2546
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:07,000
me pushing for that,

2547
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,000
me wanting that,

2548
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
turned into this

2549
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
megalithic,

2550
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
now we have 50,

2551
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
aiming to be 100,

2552
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,000
honestly,

2553
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:14,000
probably later,

2554
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
several more 100

2555
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
once all the end games,

2556
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
everything,

2557
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
start to evolve

2558
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
and more expansions

2559
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
comes out.

2560
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And I'm like,

2561
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:22,000
yep,

2562
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
we maybe just made,

2563
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:24,000
you know,

2564
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
100 times more work

2565
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
for ourselves,

2566
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
but 100% bloody worthwhile

2567
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
because I'd say

2568
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
those bosses are one

2569
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
of the main,

2570
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,000
you know,

2571
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:32,000
attraction pieces

2572
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
of the game

2573
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
and anyone who plays it

2574
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
is just like,

2575
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,000
holy crap,

2576
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,000
those boss fights

2577
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
are amazing.

2578
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
So like,

2579
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
you know,

2580
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
obviously some are bad

2581
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:41,000
and some are good

2582
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
to different people

2583
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
and all that.

2584
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:43,000
That's how it all goes.

2585
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
That's part of all the fun.

2586
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
But it is true

2587
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
that me pushing for that thing

2588
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
literally created thousands

2589
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
and thousands

2590
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:49,000
and thousands

2591
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
of hours of work.

2592
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Now,

2593
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
worthwhile work,

2594
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
but it is again

2595
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:52,000
that exact thing

2596
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
of like,

2597
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
the scope was kind of small

2598
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
on numerous axes

2599
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
and as we just raised

2600
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
and raised the quality bar

2601
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
to what we thought

2602
01:31:59,000 --> 01:31:59,000
was good,

2603
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
it certainly went from,

2604
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
you know,

2605
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
what was it initially,

2606
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
just reskinning

2607
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
some character classes

2608
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
and new rigs

2609
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:07,000
or whatever

2610
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
into this like,

2611
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
mega scale

2612
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
entire campaign.

2613
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Yeah,

2614
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,000
everything.

2615
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Full standalone,

2616
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:14,000
separate game.

2617
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Yeah.

2618
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Fun other anecdote

2619
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
since we went out

2620
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
of that territory.

2621
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It was originally

2622
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
codenamed Project Chimera.

2623
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
What?

2624
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I don't know.

2625
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
It was this pipe dream.

2626
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I've never been a fan

2627
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
of these codenames

2628
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
by things like that.

2629
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
It was this like,

2630
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
there were times,

2631
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
way back in the original Office,

2632
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
there was all this like,

2633
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
sometimes there'll be a feature

2634
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
you can't really do

2635
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
in Peewee 1

2636
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,000
and it was always like,

2637
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
ah,

2638
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
we'll do it in Project Chimera.

2639
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
That was like amongst

2640
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
the developers

2641
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
and people were like,

2642
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
what the heck is that?

2643
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Now,

2644
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
ironically,

2645
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
there is a boss

2646
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
in Act 3

2647
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:49,000
called,

2648
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
well,

2649
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,000
it's got a different name

2650
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
but it's called

2651
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
the Chimera internally.

2652
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
It is a Chimera.

2653
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
It's a multi-headed beast

2654
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:54,000
and you've seen it

2655
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
in a few of the marketing

2656
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
things here and here,

2657
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,000
different trailers,

2658
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
little snippets of it

2659
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
and I think it's just ironic

2660
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
that that was actually

2661
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
the first boss asset made

2662
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
before everything,

2663
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
the first monster

2664
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
because back in when

2665
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,000
we used to just make

2666
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
random monsters

2667
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
and we'll find out

2668
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,000
how to use them

2669
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
and that was made

2670
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
for that game.

2671
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:12,000
It was used in the

2672
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
original Peewee 2 trailer,

2673
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
right?

2674
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It is the only incomplete,

2675
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
technically,

2676
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
only from a balance room

2677
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
or it was the last boss

2678
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
to finish in the entire

2679
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Path of Exile

2680
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
to a game right now.

2681
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:24,000
It sounds like there was

2682
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
some sort of emotional demon

2683
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
that you had to battle there

2684
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
of the legacy

2685
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
of the original idea

2686
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
and you had to finish it.

2687
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
We had a moment

2688
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
with the monster game designers

2689
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:32,000
where we're like,

2690
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:33,000
oh my god,

2691
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
it's happening,

2692
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
the Chimera is finally

2693
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
being finished.

2694
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Holy,

2695
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,000
this is like,

2696
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:37,000
yeah,

2697
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,000
we were effectively like,

2698
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
we need to celebrate

2699
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
this boss finally being done.

2700
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,000
It was like,

2701
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
at the origin

2702
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
and now it's at this,

2703
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
you know,

2704
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,000
point where we're about

2705
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
to deploy early access,

2706
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,000
you know,

2707
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
not to say the end

2708
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
because the end

2709
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
is forever away.

2710
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Yeah.

2711
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Yeah,

2712
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,000
it's still the beginning

2713
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
of a journey

2714
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
in many ways.

2715
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yep.

2716
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
But on that note

2717
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
of celebrating,

2718
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
how do you guys feel

2719
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
having now kind of,

2720
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:58,000
for the first time,

2721
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I feel really like

2722
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
laid bare,

2723
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
kind of everything

2724
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:01,000
you have,

2725
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
you're putting it out there

2726
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
and only being two weeks

2727
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
away from everyone

2728
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
playing it.

2729
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Well,

2730
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
it's always scary,

2731
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
you know,

2732
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
coming into a release

2733
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:09,000
and I think especially

2734
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
for,

2735
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:10,000
you know,

2736
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:10,000
there's like,

2737
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
a bunch of people

2738
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,000
on the PeeWee 2 team

2739
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
who have,

2740
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,000
you know,

2741
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
like they have,

2742
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
this is their first game

2743
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:15,000
that they're going

2744
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:15,000
to be releasing

2745
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
and that experience

2746
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:17,000
is something that,

2747
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:18,000
you know,

2748
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:18,000
like,

2749
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:20,000
yeah,

2750
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
like it's tough

2751
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:21,000
and honestly,

2752
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I think that even we

2753
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
were feeling a little bit

2754
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
cocky actually

2755
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
about the fact

2756
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,000
because,

2757
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:26,000
you know,

2758
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,000
we release,

2759
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
you know,

2760
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
content for PeeWee 1

2761
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
all the time

2762
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:30,000
and I feel like

2763
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
we kind of felt

2764
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:31,000
like we knew

2765
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
what it took

2766
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
to get a game released

2767
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
but honestly,

2768
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,000
like PeeWee 2

2769
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
was just a whole

2770
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
entirely different demon

2771
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
as far as getting things

2772
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
out right,

2773
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
like it's just way

2774
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:40,000
more difficult,

2775
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:41,000
like when you actually

2776
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
have to make everything,

2777
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
like the whole freaking thing

2778
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
right from the ground up again,

2779
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,000
it's like,

2780
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
wow,

2781
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
there's way more stuff there

2782
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:47,000
and like,

2783
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
there's even things

2784
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
like the passive tree

2785
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
where it's like,

2786
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I feel like we underestimated

2787
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:52,000
what it would take

2788
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
to get something like that

2789
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
to an actual releasable state,

2790
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
like that was a huge amount

2791
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
of work,

2792
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
just like absolutely colossal

2793
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
to get it to,

2794
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
you know,

2795
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,000
to get that kind of stuff

2796
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
in shape,

2797
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
like it's just been crazy.

2798
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
So yeah,

2799
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
like obviously it's nerve wracking,

2800
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
you know,

2801
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
coming up to a release day

2802
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
but I think we do have something

2803
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
that players are going

2804
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
to really enjoy

2805
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:14,000
and you know,

2806
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
like it's always comforting

2807
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:15,000
when,

2808
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:15,000
you know,

2809
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I mean we had a live event

2810
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
in LA recently,

2811
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,000
you know,

2812
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:18,000
people,

2813
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:19,000
you know,

2814
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
we got to the time limit

2815
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,000
and everyone's like,

2816
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,000
oh man,

2817
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,000
we don't want to stop,

2818
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:22,000
you know,

2819
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
so I think people

2820
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:24,000
are going to really enjoy it.

2821
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
It's been a whole

2822
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
different experience for me here

2823
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
playing this time around as well

2824
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
whereas before I was playing

2825
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
a very buggy kind of

2826
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
internal version of the game

2827
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
that was very experimental

2828
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
now playing,

2829
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
you know,

2830
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
almost what I'm going

2831
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
to be playing.

2832
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Well I heard you still

2833
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
managed to blow the count

2834
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
up the elevator

2835
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
with some kind of knockback bug.

2836
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I wasn't going to mention that.

2837
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Yeah,

2838
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
we have to say,

2839
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
we have to get that word.

2840
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I did send the Act 1 boss

2841
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:47,000
up an elevator

2842
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
with knockback,

2843
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:49,000
it was good.

2844
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Intended mechanic.

2845
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I thought it was pretty funny.

2846
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
He was in his like

2847
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,000
big wolf form

2848
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
and kind of trapped in there

2849
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
so just barking at me

2850
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
through the wood.

2851
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
It's good.

2852
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
So if you feel,

2853
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:01,000
I'm sure there's a few

2854
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
things to work out

2855
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
over this next two weeks.

2856
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I hope the team can have

2857
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
a little bit of a rest

2858
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:05,000
for a day before they

2859
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
get back into it.

2860
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Yeah.

2861
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
It's been a lot.

2862
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So you've done that pivot

2863
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
to the end game focus

2864
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
and got so much for us now

2865
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
to play around with

2866
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:15,000
in the beta

2867
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
and it seems like

2868
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
originally I was thinking,

2869
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:19,000
you know,

2870
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:19,000
we might be playing

2871
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
for a few weeks here

2872
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
and then,

2873
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
you know,

2874
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
maybe going back over

2875
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
to some part of Exile 1 stuff

2876
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
but it seems like you guys

2877
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,000
want us playing

2878
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
through Christmas.

2879
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
That would certainly be good.

2880
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Look,

2881
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:29,000
there's enough stuff there

2882
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I think it will take people

2883
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
a long time to get through.

2884
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And I mean,

2885
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,000
obviously it's also

2886
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
going to be the first time

2887
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,000
people are playing

2888
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
through a completely

2889
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
fresh campaign as well.

2890
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I think that will take people

2891
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,000
a fair amount of time.

2892
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:37,000
So yeah,

2893
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
there's,

2894
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
and then of course

2895
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,000
the end game as well

2896
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:39,000
to explore.

2897
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I mean,

2898
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:40,000
yeah,

2899
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
it should be pretty significant.

2900
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I mean,

2901
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
we've always wanted it to be

2902
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
that Path of Exile 2

2903
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
leagues,

2904
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
you know,

2905
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,000
are going to be,

2906
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:48,000
you know,

2907
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
like how P1 leagues are

2908
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:51,000
where you play them

2909
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
and you play them

2910
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,000
for like,

2911
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,000
you know,

2912
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
a reasonable amount of time

2913
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
and then,

2914
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
you know,

2915
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,000
sure,

2916
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:55,000
you get done with them

2917
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
eventually

2918
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:56,000
and then you've got

2919
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
the next content

2920
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,000
that comes out.

2921
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
So yeah,

2922
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,000
in order to be able

2923
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
to realize that

2924
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,000
you have to have

2925
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
enough of a base

2926
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
to make that happen.

2927
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Yeah,

2928
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
people are definitely

2929
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:03,000
wondering like how

2930
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
invested they can get

2931
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
in the beta.

2932
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So I definitely want

2933
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
to ask a few questions

2934
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
kind of around that idea.

2935
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So firstly,

2936
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,000
is there going to be

2937
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
wipes and resets

2938
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
and will there be

2939
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
something before launch

2940
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:15,000
as well?

2941
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
So we are going to be

2942
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
having new like leagues

2943
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
effectively throughout the beta

2944
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
whenever we launch

2945
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
something significant

2946
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:21,000
because,

2947
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:21,000
you know,

2948
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
we want to make sure

2949
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:22,000
that all of the,

2950
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
you know,

2951
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:23,000
effectively that people

2952
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
are able to play through.

2953
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
But that stuff

2954
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
will be merged

2955
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
into an early access

2956
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
league.

2957
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
And effectively,

2958
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
after we go into

2959
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,000
full release,

2960
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
that league will stick around.

2961
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Now,

2962
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I can't promise

2963
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,000
that everything

2964
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
about your character

2965
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
will function exactly

2966
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
like how it did

2967
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,000
in that thing.

2968
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I imagine it will be

2969
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
a glorious kind of

2970
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
snapshot of all of the

2971
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
broken stuff I have.

2972
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:42,000
But effectively,

2973
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
we can contain all that

2974
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
stuff in the sort of

2975
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:44,000
early access league.

2976
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And then if you still

2977
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
want to play those

2978
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,000
characters,

2979
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,000
you know,

2980
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
like then you can go

2981
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:48,000
right ahead and do that.

2982
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
But,

2983
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:49,000
you know,

2984
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
the action is always

2985
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:50,000
going to be in

2986
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
whatever the most

2987
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
recent league is.

2988
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:52,000
And then,

2989
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:52,000
of course,

2990
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
after that point,

2991
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
there'll be a standard

2992
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
that everything goes into,

2993
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,000
which,

2994
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,000
you know,

2995
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
all our economic sins

2996
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
will forevermore be

2997
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
archived in the standard.

2998
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,000
So,

2999
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,000
yeah,

3000
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,000
that's,

3001
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
you know,

3002
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:03,000
no doubt what will happen.

3003
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Well,

3004
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,000
it's nice that it's,

3005
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,000
A,

3006
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
not going to be affecting

3007
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
what will be the standard

3008
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:06,000
league.

3009
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Yeah,

3010
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,000
yeah,

3011
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,000
yeah.

3012
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Also that people will be

3013
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
able to kind of get

3014
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:09,000
invested in their

3015
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
characters.

3016
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Yeah,

3017
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,000
absolutely.

3018
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I mean,

3019
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
there's even something

3020
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,000
kind of cool about the

3021
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
idea of making something

3022
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
that will be like that

3023
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
little historical piece.

3024
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Absolutely.

3025
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:17,000
A little collectible.

3026
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Absolutely.

3027
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
And I'm sure there'll be

3028
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
some handful of legacy

3029
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
things that only exist in

3030
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
early access leagues.

3031
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,000
So,

3032
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
you know,

3033
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I guess we'll have to

3034
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,000
see where it comes to

3035
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
unique balance.

3036
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
You talked about like

3037
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:26,000
the,

3038
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
you know,

3039
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
playing for a week or

3040
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
how long are we

3041
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,000
expecting?

3042
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Well,

3043
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
we sort of remember

3044
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
and a lot of the,

3045
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,000
you know,

3046
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
a lot of the P.E.

3047
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
1 players will be

3048
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
thinking very differently

3049
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,000
to people who are

3050
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
obviously going to

3051
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
experience this as a new

3052
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,000
game,

3053
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
but it is a new game,

3054
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:39,000
right?

3055
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
You don't have all

3056
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
these predefined,

3057
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
hyper refined builds

3058
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
to play to immediately,

3059
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,000
you know,

3060
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,000
go through things.

3061
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
You don't have people

3062
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
coming in with like

3063
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
fully detailed 7 million

3064
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:49,000
line,

3065
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
but with build guides

3066
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
of exactly what to do

3067
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
with what items.

3068
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
the discovery is

3069
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
going to be there.

3070
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
The discovery takes

3071
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
time and the discovery

3072
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:56,000
is like honestly

3073
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
ultra fun for me.

3074
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I love it.

3075
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Now,

3076
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,000
those things will

3077
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
emerge after time.

3078
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Of course,

3079
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
they do completely

3080
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,000
fine,

3081
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
but you should remember

3082
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
like there's a lot of

3083
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
game to play here

3084
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:06,000
to discover,

3085
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
to learn,

3086
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
learn about the world,

3087
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
the new narratives,

3088
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
the new world building,

3089
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
the new unique items,

3090
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
the ascendancy classes,

3091
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
the massive passive tree,

3092
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
which is bigger than

3093
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,000
P.E.

3094
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,000
1s,

3095
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
the end game systems,

3096
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
the bosses.

3097
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,000
It's not going to be

3098
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
this like,

3099
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
you know,

3100
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:25,000
even,

3101
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
you know,

3102
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
personally when a P.E.

3103
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
1 league comes out,

3104
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:28,000
for example,

3105
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I play for like a month,

3106
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
sometimes a bit longer,

3107
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
sometimes a bit less.

3108
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
It ultimately also depends

3109
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
largely what's going on here

3110
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
and how much I need to

3111
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
invest here.

3112
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,000
So,

3113
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,000
you know,

3114
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
and there are other people

3115
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,000
who play for more like

3116
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
three and whatnot,

3117
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
but there's certainly

3118
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
going to be a much longer

3119
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
time period you can play

3120
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
this for while still

3121
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
discovering new stuff

3122
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:45,000
and not feel like you're

3123
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
finished,

3124
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:46,000
you know what I mean?

3125
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Now,

3126
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
of course you see that

3127
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,000
subjective,

3128
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
everyone can pick their

3129
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
own point when they finish,

3130
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
but if you want to see

3131
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
everything and do everything,

3132
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
you're going to be

3133
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
investing a lot more time,

3134
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
especially these first time

3135
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
rounds and then obviously

3136
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
with every league,

3137
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,000
there's more to discover,

3138
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
but you get faster at doing

3139
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
all these parts over and

3140
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
over and over again,

3141
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
you'll get more efficient

3142
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,000
over time,

3143
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
that's how the game works.

3144
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:05,000
So,

3145
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:05,000
yeah,

3146
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I'd expect a lot of time

3147
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
to be sunk into this

3148
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
to fully explore it,

3149
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
to start with,

3150
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:10,000
like a lot,

3151
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,000
you know,

3152
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
not a week,

3153
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
not two weeks,

3154
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
you're going to be

3155
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
going far,

3156
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,000
far longer than that

3157
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
if you want to see

3158
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:17,000
everything,

3159
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
but you know,

3160
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
it's up to you,

3161
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
play at your own pace,

3162
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
see how you want to go,

3163
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
learn at your own pace,

3164
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
that's the beauty of a

3165
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
new game as well,

3166
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
which we haven't been

3167
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
able to experience

3168
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
with Path of Exile 1,

3169
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:29,000
you know,

3170
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
or other games for so long

3171
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
is actually discovering

3172
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
the entire world,

3173
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:36,000
and yeah,

3174
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
there's some familiar

3175
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
mechanics at the end game

3176
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:38,000
and stuff like that,

3177
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
which is awesome for people,

3178
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
but yeah,

3179
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I certainly want to really,

3180
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I'm very excited to see

3181
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
people discovering the new

3182
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
things and getting so

3183
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
excited about it.

3184
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I can tell you're amped

3185
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
for watching people go

3186
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
through that discovery

3187
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:51,000
process,

3188
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
maybe even diving at

3189
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:53,000
yourself a bit.

3190
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:53,000
100%,

3191
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I mean,

3192
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I love sitting there

3193
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
in Path of Building

3194
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
as many of us do,

3195
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
but I am very excited

3196
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,000
for that,

3197
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
that new discovery

3198
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
process for a while.

3199
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:05,000
I think you were saying

3200
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
how much,

3201
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
you were part spreadsheet,

3202
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I think I'm like,

3203
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I think I was saying

3204
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I'm like maybe 60%

3205
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:11,000
spreadsheet,

3206
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
40% discovery,

3207
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
and there's my play

3208
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:14,000
archetype,

3209
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
you know,

3210
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:15,000
so.

3211
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Coming up with our

3212
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:16,000
player profiles,

3213
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
teamy spikes and

3214
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:18,000
things like that,

3215
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
for both of the

3216
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
exiled characters.

3217
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
The discovery part of

3218
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,000
me is ultra excited,

3219
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,000
and I,

3220
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
and I'll mind you,

3221
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
that's coming from

3222
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:26,000
someone who kind of

3223
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
knows all the content.

3224
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I'm still,

3225
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
because there's

3226
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,000
something different

3227
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
about making it

3228
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
versus actually

3229
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:31,000
playing it live

3230
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
with the players,

3231
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
seeing them discover it,

3232
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Unique's being linked

3233
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
in chat and on Reddit

3234
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
and all of that is

3235
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:37,000
just so,

3236
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:37,000
so,

3237
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:38,000
so cool.

3238
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
So we're going to

3239
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
get a massive dose

3240
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:40,000
of that,

3241
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:41,000
and it is like

3242
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
genuinely exciting

3243
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
to just see how

3244
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:44,000
people are going to

3245
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:44,000
think,

3246
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
you know,

3247
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:45,000
what's worth one

3248
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
chaos or what's

3249
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
worth ten chaos,

3250
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:47,000
what's worth a

3251
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
hundred.

3252
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
If chaos is even

3253
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,000
the metric.

3254
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Is chaos even the

3255
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
currency that people

3256
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,000
have said already?

3257
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
We were arguing

3258
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
about this earlier.

3259
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I'm pretty sure that

3260
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
one C spam in chat

3261
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
might turn into one E,

3262
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,000
because like,

3263
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,000
you know,

3264
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
one exalt,

3265
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
given that exalt is

3266
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:01,000
now.

3267
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I think it'll be

3268
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:02,000
chaos.

3269
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:02,000
People probably,

3270
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
people don't

3271
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,000
appreciate,

3272
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,000
by the way,

3273
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,000
like,

3274
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
so when we say

3275
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,000
we've increased

3276
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,000
that,

3277
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,000
you're going to

3278
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
be getting

3279
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,000
multiple exalts

3280
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
in Act 1 in

3281
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Peewee 2.

3282
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Like,

3283
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,000
we actually have

3284
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
increased that a lot.

3285
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
It isn't just like

3286
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,000
an idle,

3287
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
you know,

3288
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I can see exalts

3289
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:14,000
becoming the new

3290
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
kind of like chaos.

3291
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Yeah,

3292
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I actually think it

3293
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
will be.

3294
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I actually agree.

3295
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I actually agree.

3296
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:19,000
But,

3297
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
yeah,

3298
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:20,000
we'll see.

3299
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
That's my point.

3300
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
But it's a new

3301
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:22,000
economy,

3302
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:22,000
right?

3303
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Like,

3304
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
who even knows?

3305
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
The market will

3306
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
have to...

3307
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:25,000
But I like they were

3308
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
already arguing about

3309
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:26,000
this.

3310
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:28,000
It's good fun.

3311
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
So,

3312
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
do you have some

3313
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
kind of like beta

3314
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
release roadmap for

3315
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
updates and things

3316
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:35,000
like that for people

3317
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
to look forward to

3318
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:36,000
with that?

3319
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:36,000
I mean,

3320
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
we certainly did

3321
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:37,000
have one six

3322
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
months ago.

3323
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
But now that we're

3324
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
sort of getting to

3325
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
release,

3326
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,000
it's like,

3327
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:43,000
oh my God,

3328
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,000
like,

3329
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,000
you know,

3330
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,000
we have to look at it.

3331
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
So,

3332
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I mean,

3333
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:45,000
look,

3334
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I don't think it'll

3335
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
be any less than

3336
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
six months.

3337
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And I think it

3338
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
could easily end up

3339
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
being more.

3340
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
I certainly don't

3341
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
want to...

3342
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Look,

3343
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
2025,

3344
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I think,

3345
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
really want to

3346
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
be full release

3347
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
in 2025.

3348
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I don't really

3349
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,000
want to be spending

3350
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,000
more than a year.

3351
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:03,000
That would be

3352
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
pretty crazy.

3353
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:04,000
But I mean,

3354
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:05,000
honestly,

3355
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:05,000
we have to get

3356
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
all the content

3357
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
finished and all

3358
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:07,000
that sort of stuff.

3359
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
We always feel

3360
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:09,000
like we underestimate

3361
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
these things.

3362
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:11,000
And of course,

3363
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
we have to learn

3364
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,000
what we need to learn.

3365
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
We have to get the

3366
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
game to the point

3367
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
when it is really

3368
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:15,000
fun.

3369
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
We have to make

3370
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:18,000
sure that all of

3371
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
the things,

3372
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,000
we've got the

3373
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
difficulty right for

3374
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,000
all the players,

3375
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,000
we've got the

3376
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
economy right,

3377
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
all the stuff.

3378
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I mean,

3379
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
there's a lot of

3380
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:23,000
things that we're

3381
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
going to have to

3382
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:24,000
sort out.

3383
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:25,000
So,

3384
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I kind of have a

3385
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:26,000
feeling that the

3386
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
first few weeks,

3387
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:27,000
at least,

3388
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
are going to just be

3389
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
a scramble of

3390
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:29,000
like,

3391
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
oh crap,

3392
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:32,000
someone worked

3393
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:32,000
this crazy thing

3394
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
out and we found

3395
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:33,000
this thing.

3396
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
That's always scary

3397
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
because it's just,

3398
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
when we add content

3399
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:39,000
to PeeWee 1,

3400
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
it's like,

3401
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
at least the kind

3402
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:41,000
of base of stuff

3403
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
that we have is

3404
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
kind of well-tested

3405
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
and people know

3406
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
what's going on with it.

3407
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
But here,

3408
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:46,000
it's just a complete

3409
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
new world.

3410
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
We're the kind of

3411
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
game that has a lot

3412
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
of ability for players

3413
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
to do stuff that

3414
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
we wouldn't anticipate.

3415
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,000
We have just the way

3416
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
support gyms work

3417
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
and everything like that.

3418
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So,

3419
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
there's certainly

3420
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
a lot of worry

3421
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
that there's just

3422
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
going to be builds

3423
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
that are completely

3424
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:04,000
ridiculous that we

3425
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
just never anticipated

3426
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
combining certain

3427
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:06,000
things in different

3428
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
ways we don't expect.

3429
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
With hundreds of

3430
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
support gyms,

3431
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:09,000
it can be like that.

3432
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,000
So,

3433
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,000
that's going to be

3434
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
an interesting one.

3435
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
It will happen.

3436
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
It is inevitable.

3437
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:14,000
There's nothing

3438
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
we can even do

3439
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
about it because

3440
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
you'd need

3441
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:18,000
hundreds and

3442
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
thousands of

3443
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
hours of testing

3444
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:20,000
to be able to

3445
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
do that with

3446
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
what can only be

3447
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:22,000
done with

3448
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
hundreds of

3449
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:23,000
thousands of

3450
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
players.

3451
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
But that's also

3452
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:27,000
the magic of it

3453
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:27,000
all,

3454
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:28,000
which is awesome.

3455
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
That's why I was

3456
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:30,000
asking,

3457
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
are you literally

3458
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
really doing 12

3459
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
classes in 36

3460
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:33,000
sentences?

3461
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Like,

3462
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
actually?

3463
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Yeah,

3464
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
absolutely.

3465
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
We know what we

3466
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
want to do.

3467
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
It's a bit unhinged.

3468
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:39,000
It is a bit.

3469
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:40,000
But,

3470
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:41,000
you know,

3471
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
we like a challenge.

3472
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I mean,

3473
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,000
you know,

3474
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
a studio that

3475
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:46,000
produces a passive

3476
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
skill tree like we

3477
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
do clearly has a

3478
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:49,000
bit of a glutton

3479
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
for punishment

3480
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
with regard to just

3481
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
mixing it.

3482
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:52,000
You totally could

3483
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
have done six and

3484
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,000
then,

3485
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I don't know,

3486
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:54,000
added more later

3487
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
in an expansion

3488
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,000
or something.

3489
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Yeah,

3490
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:56,000
I mean,

3491
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:57,000
maybe we could have.

3492
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I mean,

3493
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
look,

3494
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
this is the plan.

3495
01:44:59,000 --> 01:44:59,000
This is the plan.

3496
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:01,000
I mean,

3497
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
as you go through,

3498
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:02,000
as people go through

3499
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
early access,

3500
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:03,000
it's going to feel

3501
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,000
like there's just

3502
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
expansion content

3503
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:05,000
coming up pretty

3504
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:05,000
frequently.

3505
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Just because,

3506
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:07,000
you know,

3507
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:07,000
we have all the

3508
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
stuff that we've

3509
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:08,000
kind of,

3510
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:08,000
you know,

3511
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
got a lot of the

3512
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
way through.

3513
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:11,000
So,

3514
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
yeah,

3515
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:12,000
there's stuff to come.

3516
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I mean,

3517
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:12,000
look,

3518
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:13,000
I'm pretty sure,

3519
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:13,000
like,

3520
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I really want to get

3521
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:14,000
the Druid out.

3522
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Like,

3523
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
we announced it,

3524
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
we've talked about it.

3525
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,000
It's a lot of fun.

3526
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,000
You know,

3527
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I'm keen to get that

3528
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
out there as soon as we can.

3529
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:19,000
You know,

3530
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
the Huntress,

3531
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
we've talked a bunch

3532
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:21,000
about as well.

3533
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Those kinds of things,

3534
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:23,000
I think,

3535
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:23,000
we'll be,

3536
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:24,000
you know,

3537
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
we'll be able to move

3538
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
towards those pretty quick.

3539
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:27,000
But,

3540
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:27,000
you know,

3541
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:27,000
there's,

3542
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:28,000
yeah,

3543
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:28,000
obviously more to do.

3544
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:29,000
The other thing you

3545
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
mentioned,

3546
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
talking roadmap-like things,

3547
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
is we've always been,

3548
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:35,000
you know,

3549
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
it's hard to predict

3550
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,000
because a lot of

3551
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
what will happen is,

3552
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
and what we leave

3553
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:39,000
space for,

3554
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
is reacting to

3555
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
what the players want.

3556
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And so,

3557
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
if you plan everything

3558
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
long,

3559
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:45,000
you're going to have

3560
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:45,000
very,

3561
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
very,

3562
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
very slow reaction times

3563
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:47,000
to fixing,

3564
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:48,000
you know,

3565
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
or adding certain content

3566
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
where they're,

3567
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:50,000
you know,

3568
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
maybe the issue is,

3569
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
ah,

3570
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
the campaign needs more

3571
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:53,000
of this,

3572
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
or this class needs

3573
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:54,000
more of this,

3574
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
or something.

3575
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:55,000
So,

3576
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
if you're planning,

3577
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:56,000
then you're going

3578
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
to be delivering

3579
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
on what they want

3580
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
solved,

3581
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
like a year down the line

3582
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
or even longer.

3583
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And where we like

3584
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
to remain very,

3585
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
very dynamic

3586
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:04,000
and like,

3587
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
you know,

3588
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
you want to be able

3589
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
to fix that stuff.

3590
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Like,

3591
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:07,000
oh,

3592
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:07,000
well,

3593
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
this is the main problem.

3594
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Like,

3595
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:09,000
sure,

3596
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:09,000
obviously you need more

3597
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
than a week,

3598
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,000
sometimes,

3599
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
most of the time.

3600
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:12,000
But,

3601
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:13,000
we want it generally

3602
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
to be that the next

3603
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
releases,

3604
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,000
expansions,

3605
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
updates,

3606
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,000
whatever,

3607
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
can alleviate

3608
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
as many of those

3609
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
problems as possible.

3610
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:20,000
So,

3611
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:21,000
yeah,

3612
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
you try not to get

3613
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
too strict with the planning

3614
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
has generally been

3615
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
our philosophy

3616
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,000
because,

3617
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:27,000
especially when it comes

3618
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
to actually having

3619
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
the live service product out

3620
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
because that is

3621
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:31,000
very,

3622
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
very important.

3623
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Otherwise,

3624
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
you're never going to

3625
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
seem like you're doing

3626
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:35,000
what people want

3627
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
and what are you doing

3628
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:37,000
if not that?

3629
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:38,000
So,

3630
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
that actually is a good point.

3631
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I was going to ask,

3632
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
what do you folks,

3633
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
what does a team want

3634
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
out of the beta?

3635
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Because,

3636
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:44,000
obviously,

3637
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
it's a good way

3638
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
to market the game,

3639
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
but it's also,

3640
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
you know,

3641
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
key to shaping the game

3642
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
in the future.

3643
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Like,

3644
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,000
the actual beta.

3645
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
It's not just early access.

3646
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I think one of the most

3647
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,000
important things,

3648
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I think it's going to be

3649
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
really good for the

3650
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
development team to get

3651
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
back into a live

3652
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
mindset and,

3653
01:46:59,000 --> 01:46:59,000
like,

3654
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
get it back into the idea

3655
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,000
of,

3656
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,000
like,

3657
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
everything we make

3658
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,000
is shipping.

3659
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
People are seeing this.

3660
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Like,

3661
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
get back into this,

3662
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
you know,

3663
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:05,000
like,

3664
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:05,000
actually getting back

3665
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:05,000
on that and,

3666
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,000
like,

3667
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
being able to sort of

3668
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,000
see directly,

3669
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:08,000
like,

3670
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:08,000
okay,

3671
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
we make something,

3672
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:09,000
it goes in the game,

3673
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
people like it,

3674
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:10,000
don't like it,

3675
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:10,000
like,

3676
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
that kind of stuff.

3677
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Like,

3678
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
that really,

3679
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,000
like,

3680
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:13,000
that has been our studio

3681
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
for,

3682
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,000
like,

3683
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
most of its lifetime.

3684
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Obviously,

3685
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
before we released

3686
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Peerwee 1,

3687
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,000
it wasn't,

3688
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
but after that point,

3689
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I mean,

3690
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
we are a company,

3691
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,000
like,

3692
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:21,000
we are a company

3693
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
that likes to think

3694
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
that we can do live

3695
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
service better than

3696
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,000
anyone else.

3697
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Like,

3698
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
that is our goal.

3699
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,000
And so,

3700
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,000
like,

3701
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
getting back into that,

3702
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,000
again,

3703
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,000
you know,

3704
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,000
for the entire,

3705
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
for everyone in the studio,

3706
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
so that everyone's

3707
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:31,000
working on things

3708
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
that are going to be

3709
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
releasing within,

3710
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,000
you know,

3711
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
certainly in less time

3712
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,000
than,

3713
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,000
you know,

3714
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
than three months away,

3715
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
is,

3716
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I think,

3717
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
really good for us again.

3718
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I look forward to just

3719
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
being able to do that

3720
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
because these long-term,

3721
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,000
like,

3722
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
really long-term things

3723
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
that span over years,

3724
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:46,000
it's like,

3725
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
you go so long

3726
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,000
without proper feedback,

3727
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:48,000
like,

3728
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
stuff kind of gets made

3729
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:49,000
and then,

3730
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:50,000
like,

3731
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:50,000
you know,

3732
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
it's not really

3733
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,000
in a real game

3734
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:52,000
and so it doesn't

3735
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
get tested properly.

3736
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:54,000
And you absolutely

3737
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,000
lose perspective on this stuff.

3738
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:56,000
So,

3739
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
I think that that's just

3740
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
going to be really great

3741
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
to get back to that again.

3742
01:47:59,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yeah.

3743
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Honestly,

3744
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,000
as you said,

3745
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
it is early access,

3746
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
it is a beta period

3747
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
and I'd say,

3748
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:05,000
you know,

3749
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:06,000
personally speaking,

3750
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
the thing that,

3751
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
and we mentioned it briefly

3752
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
about the character balance

3753
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
and the builds that are broken

3754
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
and all that,

3755
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
that's obviously

3756
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
pretty useful to me,

3757
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:14,000
right?

3758
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Yeah.

3759
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Plus,

3760
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
we have other systems

3761
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
in there,

3762
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:17,000
like,

3763
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
you know,

3764
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
the checkpointing system,

3765
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
right?

3766
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:20,000
You have to kill the boss

3767
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
in one life,

3768
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,000
you know,

3769
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
these are things

3770
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
we haven't mass tested

3771
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
and obviously other games

3772
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
have and they work

3773
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
and that's awesome.

3774
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
There are other things

3775
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:28,000
like,

3776
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:29,000
you know,

3777
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
the end game system

3778
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,000
is a little bit less forgiving

3779
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
and that if you die,

3780
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:33,000
you fail the map,

3781
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:34,000
right?

3782
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
These things are things

3783
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:36,000
that we obviously need

3784
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
to test and iterate on

3785
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:38,000
in the future

3786
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
by adjusting the difficulty

3787
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
and stuff like that

3788
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:41,000
and you,

3789
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
especially as you get

3790
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
towards this point

3791
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:43,000
of,

3792
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
you know,

3793
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
the end game,

3794
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
like,

3795
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:47,000
okay,

3796
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Act 1 has been tested

3797
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
like crazy,

3798
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
right?

3799
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:50,000
And you get less

3800
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
and less testing

3801
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
as it goes on

3802
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:52,000
because you get

3803
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
less people,

3804
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:54,000
you know,

3805
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
they've just been around

3806
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
for less time.

3807
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
And so,

3808
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:57,000
yeah,

3809
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
it's going to be

3810
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
a huge amount

3811
01:48:59,000 --> 01:48:59,000
of iteration

3812
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
and feedback

3813
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
and from the players

3814
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
and us just,

3815
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,000
you know,

3816
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
re-evaluating all the stuff

3817
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:04,000
and the thing is

3818
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
we're always dynamic

3819
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
about that stuff,

3820
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:06,000
like,

3821
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
we'll just change things

3822
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:08,000
if it's wrong,

3823
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
we'll redesign it,

3824
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
we'll come up

3825
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
with a new way.

3826
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Jonathan's a firm believer

3827
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
of if A doesn't work

3828
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
and B doesn't work,

3829
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
then we'll find C,

3830
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
we'll find option C,

3831
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
we'll find option D

3832
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
and we'll keep changing things

3833
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
and we'll make it work.

3834
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,000
So,

3835
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
yeah,

3836
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,000
it's going to be a lot

3837
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
of that iteration

3838
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
on our design decisions,

3839
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
how forgiving,

3840
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,000
because,

3841
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,000
like,

3842
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
the game is pretty hard,

3843
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,000
you know,

3844
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
it can be pretty hard.

3845
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,000
And so,

3846
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,000
when you're on that fine line

3847
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
of, like,

3848
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:31,000
you know,

3849
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
things are difficult,

3850
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
you know,

3851
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
it's not too easy to know

3852
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:35,000
if you've tilted

3853
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,000
one way or the other,

3854
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:36,000
so,

3855
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:37,000
you know,

3856
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
finding what everyone agrees

3857
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
should be the common

3858
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:40,000
correct difficulty

3859
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
is something that I will

3860
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
obviously be paying

3861
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,000
very,

3862
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:43,000
very,

3863
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
very close attention to.

3864
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
It's a pretty hard thing

3865
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:45,000
to nail down

3866
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
when you are making the game.

3867
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Mm-hmm.

3868
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:49,000
And,

3869
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
so,

3870
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
we've seen that a lot

3871
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
where you folks have been

3872
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
pretty willing to change

3873
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
and then re-change

3874
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
and re-change again

3875
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
some of the core features

3876
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:56,000
like flasks

3877
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
and the waypointing system

3878
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:58,000
and portals

3879
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
and keeping that kind of mindset

3880
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
going into the beta then.

3881
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Of course.

3882
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I mean,

3883
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:02,000
look,

3884
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:02,000
we're always willing

3885
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
to change stuff.

3886
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Like,

3887
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
that flask thing,

3888
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:04,000
like,

3889
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
the most recent change

3890
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:05,000
to that was,

3891
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
like,

3892
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,000
ultra-recent.

3893
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Like,

3894
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I don't,

3895
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:08,000
have we even had,

3896
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:09,000
like,

3897
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
a closed beta of that yet?

3898
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:11,000
No.

3899
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I think we haven't,

3900
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
yeah.

3901
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:13,000
But,

3902
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I mean,

3903
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I think it's way better

3904
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
than it was.

3905
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Like,

3906
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:15,000
it's,

3907
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
things have improved a lot.

3908
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:17,000
And honestly,

3909
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:17,000
like,

3910
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:18,000
that's one of those things

3911
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
we've been wanting to do,

3912
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,000
something to sort out flasks

3913
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
for ages.

3914
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Yep.

3915
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:22,000
And it really came about

3916
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
because,

3917
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
when actually looking at

3918
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
what new players

3919
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
were having trouble with

3920
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:27,000
when they were playing,

3921
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
flask piano was actually,

3922
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:29,000
like,

3923
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
even from the very beginning

3924
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:31,000
of the game,

3925
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
actually ended up being

3926
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:32,000
one of those things

3927
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:32,000
that,

3928
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
like,

3929
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
people just had problems,

3930
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:34,000
just like,

3931
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
just the manual dexterity

3932
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
required to,

3933
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:37,000
like,

3934
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
hit all your different flask keys

3935
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
and then,

3936
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
like,

3937
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,000
know,

3938
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,000
like,

3939
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
you have to know

3940
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
when one of your flasks

3941
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:42,000
has run out

3942
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
actually was,

3943
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:45,000
like,

3944
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
just a weirdly large amount

3945
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
of mechanical complexity

3946
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
right from the very beginning.

3947
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And then,

3948
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:50,000
even at endgame,

3949
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
I don't think it was really

3950
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
that satisfying either

3951
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
because you ended up with,

3952
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:53,000
like,

3953
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:53,000
you know,

3954
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:53,000
just,

3955
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:53,000
like,

3956
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
having to press all these

3957
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
buttons all the time

3958
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,000
and obviously it's all

3959
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,000
utility flasks that people

3960
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
are using at endgame.

3961
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
And then we kind of tried

3962
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
to band-aid this in POE1

3963
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
with the,

3964
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:01,000
you know,

3965
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
some of the flask automation

3966
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
stuff that was added there.

3967
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
But there was still this idea

3968
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
that you're still more powerful

3969
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
if you don't automate.

3970
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
So,

3971
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,000
therefore,

3972
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,000
you know,

3973
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
like,

3974
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:11,000
it's like,

3975
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:11,000
you know,

3976
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
there's that trade-off there.

3977
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
You're just more powerful

3978
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
if you get mage blood,

3979
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:16,000
really.

3980
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Sure,

3981
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
sure,

3982
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I guess.

3983
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I mean,

3984
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
it's all automated

3985
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
and you're very powerful.

3986
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Yeah,

3987
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:20,000
sure,

3988
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
all right.

3989
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:21,000
But,

3990
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
you know,

3991
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:22,000
so the point is,

3992
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:22,000
effectively,

3993
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
the charm stuff that we're

3994
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:24,000
doing effectively means

3995
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
that you no longer,

3996
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
the game is making that

3997
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,000
decision of,

3998
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:27,000
like,

3999
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:27,000
you know,

4000
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
that stuff will be

4001
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,000
automated.

4002
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,000
You no longer have to do

4003
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
that,

4004
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:30,000
like,

4005
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
crazy flask piano to get

4006
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:31,000
the best,

4007
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
you know,

4008
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
the best out of your

4009
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:33,000
character.

4010
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:33,000
And I think that is

4011
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
definitely a step in the

4012
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:34,000
right direction.

4013
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
And the other thing as well

4014
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
is it actually makes

4015
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
the crafting more

4016
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:39,000
meaningful,

4017
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I think,

4018
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:40,000
on the flasks.

4019
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Because when you've got,

4020
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:41,000
like,

4021
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
five slots,

4022
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:42,000
then,

4023
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
like,

4024
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
the individual mods

4025
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:44,000
and the individual stuff,

4026
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
like,

4027
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
seems to tend to not matter

4028
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
as much.

4029
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I mean,

4030
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:47,000
obviously,

4031
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,000
you know,

4032
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:48,000
people want instant recovery

4033
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
and things like that,

4034
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:49,000
but,

4035
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
you know,

4036
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:50,000
like,

4037
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
now it's like the actual,

4038
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
it's much more meaningful,

4039
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:54,000
like,

4040
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
on your life flask,

4041
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
the choice between,

4042
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
do I want instant or do I

4043
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
want way more life?

4044
01:51:59,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Like,

4045
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
that kind of stuff actually

4046
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,000
can be a lot more meaningful

4047
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
once you've only got one.

4048
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:02,000
So,

4049
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:02,000
yeah,

4050
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I think it is a lot better

4051
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
personally.

4052
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
flask since we're on the topic.

4053
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,000
You have,

4054
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
locked in effectively,

4055
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:12,000
the fact that there's

4056
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
a mana flask there now.

4057
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:13,000
So,

4058
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
there's always going to be

4059
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,000
a mana flask slot.

4060
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:16,000
And,

4061
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
how does that tie into

4062
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
your design for mana?

4063
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:19,000
And,

4064
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:20,000
are we always going to be

4065
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
using a mana flask slot?

4066
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Or,

4067
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
if we solve another way,

4068
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
what does it do?

4069
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
You can absolutely solve

4070
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:25,000
another way,

4071
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
and then you'll just have

4072
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
a flask slot that isn't

4073
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:27,000
doing anything,

4074
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
for sure.

4075
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:28,000
But,

4076
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
I think it kind of has to

4077
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:29,000
work that way,

4078
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
because we really don't want,

4079
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,000
yeah,

4080
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,000
because,

4081
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:33,000
like,

4082
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
once you sort of start

4083
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
getting into changing that around,

4084
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I feel like the system

4085
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:38,000
sort of starts to break

4086
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
with regard to,

4087
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:39,000
like,

4088
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:39,000
you know,

4089
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
the feeling of,

4090
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:41,000
like,

4091
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I know where mana is,

4092
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I know where my health is,

4093
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:43,000
like that kind of stuff.

4094
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
That being said,

4095
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:44,000
you know,

4096
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
we've always got uniques

4097
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
and stuff like that.

4098
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I believe there's already...

4099
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Yeah,

4100
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
there is a unique

4101
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
that allows you to equip

4102
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
two more flasks.

4103
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:50,000
But the thing is,

4104
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
then that's a build choice

4105
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
that you're making,

4106
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
so it's a little bit different,

4107
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:53,000
and that's fine.

4108
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:54,000
But,

4109
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
yeah,

4110
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I think the system

4111
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:56,000
as it works now,

4112
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
just,

4113
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:57,000
yeah,

4114
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
it's a lot easier.

4115
01:52:59,000 --> 01:52:59,000
So,

4116
01:52:59,000 --> 01:52:59,000
it does sound like

4117
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
on the mana side of things,

4118
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:01,000
then,

4119
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
edition number 475

4120
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
is how it works.

4121
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:09,000
And,

4122
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
we've finally got it right

4123
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:11,000
this time.

4124
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:12,000
So,

4125
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
you know,

4126
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
the,

4127
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,000
and,

4128
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,000
yeah,

4129
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
I think it works,

4130
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
and I think it's good,

4131
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
so I think that Leech

4132
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
will be more common.

4133
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I'm not going to have to,

4134
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,000
like,

4135
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
crack out the Leech diagram

4136
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
showing the different buckets

4137
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:23,000
and things like that.

4138
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I was saying,

4139
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I think that Leech might be,

4140
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
no,

4141
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I think,

4142
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I was going to say,

4143
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Leech is one of the topics

4144
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:29,000
in the studio

4145
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
that has wasted

4146
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
the most designer time

4147
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
of anything in the industry.

4148
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
But I actually don't think it's that.

4149
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
I think the actual worst offender

4150
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
is what stats should Dex give you?

4151
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I think that that is,

4152
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:39,000
like,

4153
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
that one has wasted so,

4154
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
there's so many arguments about that.

4155
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I feel like that one's never come to the fore.

4156
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Like,

4157
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
we know about the Leech one.

4158
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
But no one is happy about it giving accuracy,

4159
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
but no one has a better idea

4160
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
than what accuracy that it can give.

4161
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:51,000
And,

4162
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:51,000
like,

4163
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
everyone's going to come up and chat a bit.

4164
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I bet they'll be,

4165
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,000
like,

4166
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,000
saying,

4167
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,000
oh,

4168
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:54,000
you know,

4169
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:54,000
it can give this or this,

4170
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:55,000
whatever.

4171
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
But,

4172
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:56,000
there's,

4173
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:56,000
like,

4174
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:57,000
yeah,

4175
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:57,000
seriously,

4176
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
there's been endless arguments about that topic.

4177
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:00,000
It's,

4178
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:00,000
like,

4179
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
it's outrageous.

4180
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Yeah,

4181
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,000
you've got me thinking about it now.

4182
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Yeah.

4183
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:07,000
I mean,

4184
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
speed would be good,

4185
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:09,000
but then,

4186
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
it's probably too much.

4187
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Something like Dex,

4188
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:12,000
you just can't.

4189
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Yeah,

4190
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Dex talking speed.

4191
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:16,000
We can get all the designers down here right now.

4192
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Yeah,

4193
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I know,

4194
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
we'll just have it out again.

4195
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
We'll just have it out again.

4196
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
The longest Q&A of all time.

4197
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Yeah,

4198
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,000
yeah,

4199
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,000
yeah.

4200
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
It's already going to be that.

4201
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Sometimes you're just,

4202
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:24,000
like,

4203
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
you start the day,

4204
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:26,000
you're like,

4205
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
here are the problems we need to solve.

4206
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
And then you're like,

4207
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
oh,

4208
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:29,000
no,

4209
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
it's 3pm,

4210
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
and we're still discussing Dexterity.

4211
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Yeah,

4212
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
yeah.

4213
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,000
It's like,

4214
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
all right,

4215
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
just make it accuracy again.

4216
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Exactly,

4217
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:38,000
exactly.

4218
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
And that is literally how it comes back to accuracy every time.

4219
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
This is okay.

4220
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Yeah.

4221
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Rewinding a little bit,

4222
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
we can't forget our roots with Path of Exile 1,

4223
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
of course.

4224
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:50,000
So,

4225
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
for the POE 1 enjoyers,

4226
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
what is the plan for POE 1 during the course of this beta?

4227
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Is there going to be leagues launching?

4228
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Is it on the back burner?

4229
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Yeah,

4230
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
there absolutely will be leagues launching.

4231
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Now,

4232
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I can't,

4233
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I don't know the exact date,

4234
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,000
but the plan is kind of late February.

4235
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Yeah.

4236
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
But,

4237
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I mean,

4238
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:03,000
look,

4239
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
it's,

4240
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
we'll see what happens.

4241
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I will admit,

4242
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
unfortunately,

4243
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
we did have to steal a few POE 1 resources just towards the end here,

4244
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
which has kind of been a bit unfortunate.

4245
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I really wish we didn't have to.

4246
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
But,

4247
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:15,000
yeah,

4248
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:15,000
as I said,

4249
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
we kind of underestimated some of the stuff.

4250
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:17,000
But,

4251
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,000
everyone is going to be going back to POE 1 again for the February,

4252
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
for the February league.

4253
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
And,

4254
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:24,000
you know,

4255
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
we're going to make sure that we can,

4256
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
we can do that.

4257
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Like,

4258
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
one of the things that was a big problem for our studio,

4259
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
when we had a long-term project and a short-term project.

4260
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Yeah.

4261
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Is that,

4262
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
you know,

4263
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
you've always had that thing of like,

4264
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:34,000
it's always,

4265
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
you always want to work on the short-term thing.

4266
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Yeah.

4267
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:36,000
So,

4268
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
now that we've got two short-term things coming up,

4269
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:39,000
actually,

4270
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
it's going to be a bit easier to prioritize in some respects.

4271
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Funnily enough.

4272
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:42,000
You know,

4273
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:42,000
it's like,

4274
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:42,000
it's all,

4275
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:43,000
it's just like,

4276
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
it's all that stuff is then,

4277
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
you know,

4278
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
is like coming up soon.

4279
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:46,000
So,

4280
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
but we'll see,

4281
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:48,000
we'll see how it goes.

4282
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
But,

4283
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:49,000
yeah,

4284
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
we need to get that POE 1 expansion up next.

4285
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Yeah.

4286
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Obviously,

4287
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
you know,

4288
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I just want to always make it clear that,

4289
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:57,000
you know,

4290
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
the reason why things can't be so planned out is,

4291
01:55:59,000 --> 01:55:59,000
again,

4292
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
we're just releasing this game.

4293
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Yeah.

4294
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Obviously,

4295
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
we pivoted to end game and then that needed more resources.

4296
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:05,000
And then,

4297
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
of course,

4298
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
combined with the fact that,

4299
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
you know,

4300
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
things obviously change.

4301
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
There are unpredictable things in the environment.

4302
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
We can't necessarily guarantee.

4303
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:15,000
And then,

4304
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
of course,

4305
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:16,000
you have,

4306
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
you know,

4307
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Christmas coming up and all of that,

4308
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:22,000
right?

4309
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
There's so many variables to consider.

4310
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:24,000
And,

4311
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:31,000
but we also don't know how much time is going to be invested necessarily or need to be invested into live operations for post-release.

4312
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
How many problems are going to go wrong?

4313
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
How many builds are there?

4314
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
How many of the uniques are broken?

4315
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:36,000
How many,

4316
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:36,000
you know,

4317
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
and where do all these resources go?

4318
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
There are like just millions of variables here to consider.

4319
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:41,000
And so,

4320
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:42,000
like,

4321
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:42,000
it can get very,

4322
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:43,000
very difficult,

4323
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
especially at this time.

4324
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
But once you release,

4325
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
you have a bit of a grace period.

4326
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
So to speak,

4327
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
we're more like a period of extreme amounts of fire where we're putting out fires everywhere.

4328
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
But we have a,

4329
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
we have a period where we're fixing everything.

4330
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
You get everything stable.

4331
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
And then we're going to be like,

4332
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
all right,

4333
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
let's recalibrate,

4334
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
figure everything out.

4335
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
And what is our plans?

4336
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,000
And then establish all of that based also on the feedback we get from that,

4337
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
you know,

4338
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
period where everything's on fire.

4339
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Not to make it sound like it's going to be bad,

4340
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
but that is the inevitability is that there's always problems.

4341
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Hopefully it appears good from a player perspective,

4342
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
but there's always going to be,

4343
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
there's always going to be like,

4344
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
oh my God,

4345
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,000
people found this.

4346
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,000
And you know,

4347
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,000
like,

4348
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,000
yeah.

4349
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
We don't have to see all the fires.

4350
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Yeah.

4351
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Like ideally,

4352
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:29,000
ideally the best thing is when we're able to fix some kind of exploit before people even hear about it.

4353
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Yeah.

4354
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,000
And when I say exploit,

4355
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I'm just talking about some broken thing.

4356
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Like if we,

4357
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:32,000
like,

4358
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
so we obviously normally have to worry about like the whole mid league nerf concept,

4359
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
but it's like,

4360
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
if you can,

4361
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
if you can deal with something within like an hour or two of it happening,

4362
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
then it's like,

4363
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
you're kind of okay.

4364
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Because,

4365
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
you know,

4366
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
no one had a chance to kind of like everyone,

4367
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
everyone didn't swap their build over to it or whatever.

4368
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Yeah.

4369
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
But yeah,

4370
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
we're going to be really on the ball for Pee Wee 2,

4371
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
just because there's so many things that are new.

4372
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Wow.

4373
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:53,000
I mean,

4374
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:53,000
look,

4375
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
we have several bosses with several elevators.

4376
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
How many of them can be pushed up the elevator?

4377
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:00,000
You know what I mean?

4378
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I'll try it out.

4379
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
When I say fire,

4380
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
I'm talking about bosses getting pushed up elevators.

4381
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Like that's not okay.

4382
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I am liking my mercenary flashbang knockback is very fun.

4383
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Right.

4384
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Yeah.

4385
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
You need to look into that,

4386
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:12,000
by the way.

4387
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
The whole flashbang.

4388
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I feel like you're going to nerf my build.

4389
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Yeah.

4390
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Yeah.

4391
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Stay away from my grenade up.

4392
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
He's finding fires already.

4393
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Yeah.

4394
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
No,

4395
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:20,000
no.

4396
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
These are the fun things.

4397
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Discovering that stuff can be very fun for the players.

4398
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,000
It's just internally.

4399
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,000
It's like,

4400
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,000
oh no,

4401
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,000
what are we doing?

4402
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
It can get a little bit panicky after release,

4403
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
you know,

4404
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:28,000
and it,

4405
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
you know,

4406
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
there's lots of things going on.

4407
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:30,000
You're like,

4408
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
oh geez,

4409
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,000
what do I solve first?

4410
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
But obviously,

4411
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
you know,

4412
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,000
it's the same as PeeWee 1.

4413
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
We're good at it at this point.

4414
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Got some experience.

4415
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Yeah.

4416
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,000
New belts.

4417
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:44,000
You aren't going to be torturing us with like releasing beta stuff at the same time as PeeWee 2 league launch,

4418
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
PeeWee 1 league launch is like.

4419
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Yeah.

4420
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
The plan is to keep them separated a bit from each other so that,

4421
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
you know,

4422
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:49,000
you get a chance to play with both teams.

4423
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Don't make me choose.

4424
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Yeah,

4425
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
yeah,

4426
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:51,000
yeah.

4427
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:52,000
So,

4428
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,000
we saw a cinematic.

4429
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Mm-hmm.

4430
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Mm-hmm.

4431
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
To put it lightly.

4432
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:56,000
It was pretty,

4433
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:57,000
that was quite epic.

4434
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:58,000
And,

4435
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
and I know it's been cooking for quite some time.

4436
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Mm-hmm.

4437
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:01,000
And,

4438
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,000
that was pretty exciting,

4439
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
but we've also seen just a lot of story stuff happening,

4440
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:06,000
you know,

4441
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
on a much higher level than previously now.

4442
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:09,000
So,

4443
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
stepping up your storytelling game here a bit.

4444
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Yeah,

4445
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,000
so we're really wanting to make sure that the storytelling in PeeWee 2 is much better than what it was in PeeWee 1.

4446
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Like,

4447
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:17,000
you know,

4448
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
there's a lot more kind of,

4449
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I guess,

4450
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,000
like,

4451
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
that kind of like stuff with the,

4452
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
like the introductions to boss fights and the outros and things like that.

4453
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Like,

4454
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
all that stuff,

4455
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
we've just got a lot more storytelling going in,

4456
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:28,000
all of those,

4457
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
all of those things.

4458
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
We do have the intro cutscene.

4459
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:31,000
There's also,

4460
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
can kind of like light,

4461
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
like between the acts,

4462
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
there's these kind of like more kind of motion graphic type cutscenes,

4463
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
just kind of established things.

4464
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:39,000
And,

4465
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
there might be some more surprises later on in the game as well.

4466
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Not in early access,

4467
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:42,000
unfortunately,

4468
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
later on that,

4469
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
that we can,

4470
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
that you can see as well.

4471
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:46,000
But,

4472
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:46,000
ultimately,

4473
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:47,000
we just want to make sure that,

4474
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:48,000
like,

4475
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I think a lot of people who got through the PeeWee 1 story had no idea what was happening by the end.

4476
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:53,000
And so,

4477
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:54,000
effectively,

4478
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
we want to make sure that that is not the case this time around,

4479
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
that people really are able to absorb things.

4480
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Guilty.

4481
01:59:59,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Guilty.

4482
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
One thing I will say,

4483
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
though,

4484
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,000
is that it's ultra important to us that we don't break the feeling that,

4485
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:05,000
like,

4486
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
when you're playing a second time,

4487
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:07,000
that it,

4488
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:07,000
like,

4489
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:07,000
that it feels,

4490
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:08,000
like,

4491
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
we don't want it to feel annoying the second time.

4492
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Yeah.

4493
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
We were talking about this this morning.

4494
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Yeah,

4495
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
yeah.

4496
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
We don't take the control out of the player's hands.

4497
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Exactly.

4498
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
So,

4499
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:14,000
yeah,

4500
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I'm,

4501
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I'm a personally,

4502
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
a believer of the fact that if you just change,

4503
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:17,000
if,

4504
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
when you change the camera position for a cutscene,

4505
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
immediately it feels way more annoying.

4506
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Like,

4507
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:23,000
cause there's this whole,

4508
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,000
this whole thing of like,

4509
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:24,000
like,

4510
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
if you click on an NPC and like the camera changes position,

4511
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,000
that kind of thing is like,

4512
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:30,000
you know,

4513
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
like that can be cool.

4514
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
But then the,

4515
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:33,000
the,

4516
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:33,000
if,

4517
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
if you're like,

4518
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:36,000
you're playing through the,

4519
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:36,000
you know,

4520
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,000
second,

4521
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:37,000
third,

4522
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:37,000
fourth,

4523
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
fifth time,

4524
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
you want to just be able to go to the NPC and click,

4525
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:39,000
click,

4526
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:39,000
click,

4527
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
click,

4528
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
and just get past without feeling like you've,

4529
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
you've had to sort of worry about anything.

4530
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
So,

4531
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:45,000
yeah,

4532
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
like effectively we want to make sure that it's still,

4533
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
that we still have that,

4534
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,000
you know,

4535
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:49,000
because ultimately,

4536
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:50,000
you know,

4537
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
we're a game you expect people to,

4538
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
people to play through many times.

4539
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So ideally we can kind of deliver both the situation where the first time you play

4540
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:56,000
through it,

4541
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
it feels like an amazing story that you're getting,

4542
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
that you're taking seriously,

4543
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
that you're understanding that you,

4544
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:00,000
you know,

4545
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
there's like all those sort of touch points and,

4546
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,000
you know,

4547
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
little,

4548
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,000
little,

4549
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
you know,

4550
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
things just all through while also maintaining the fact that if you know what

4551
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:07,000
you're doing,

4552
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
it's like,

4553
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
you don't have to go talk to some quest giver just to get a quest.

4554
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Like you could just go do the thing,

4555
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
you know,

4556
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
without having to talk to someone about it first.

4557
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,000
So,

4558
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
you know,

4559
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
that kind of stuff is really important just to make the,

4560
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:17,000
you know,

4561
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
that,

4562
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
that stuff work well when you,

4563
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
when you know what you're doing.

4564
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Yeah.

4565
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
You said something this morning that stuck with me where you said like part of

4566
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
exile is a game where the player's meta knowledge is allowed and encouraged.

4567
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Absolutely.

4568
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Absolutely.

4569
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:26,000
You're allowed to cheat.

4570
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:27,000
There's quests.

4571
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
There's what the character knows and there's what the player knows.

4572
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
And in our game,

4573
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000
what the player knows is,

4574
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
is needs to be sufficient as far as like being able to progress the storyline.

4575
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,000
If you can,

4576
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:37,000
you're not,

4577
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
you don't want to have it.

4578
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
So you just talk to NBC just to find out something you already knew as a

4579
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:41,000
player.

4580
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Yeah.

4581
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Like if you know,

4582
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,000
you kill this boss,

4583
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
you get the next area's waypoint.

4584
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
So you just like kill it,

4585
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:46,000
log out,

4586
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:46,000
log in.

4587
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
I love doing that.

4588
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Yeah.

4589
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:54,000
So you explained to me the other day,

4590
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:59,000
the kind of the context for the beast and how that leads into the cut scene

4591
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
in the beginning of Pee Wee 2 from Pee Wee 1.

4592
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
And that I think helped put it in a lot more perspective for me and made me

4593
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
appreciate and understand what's going on.

4594
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Yeah.

4595
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,000
So effectively what you're seeing in the opening cut scene is effectively the,

4596
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,000
a new,

4597
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
a new seed of a beast that is going to be,

4598
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:16,000
is growing.

4599
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Now in Pee Wee 1,

4600
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:18,000
you know,

4601
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
the beast,

4602
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,000
the beast was killed.

4603
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
And then what happened in response to that is a bunch of all of the,

4604
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
the gods in the world were able to,

4605
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
you know,

4606
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
were able to effectively rise again.

4607
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
And you killed a bunch of them,

4608
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,000
but there are more,

4609
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:31,000
you know,

4610
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:31,000
in the world.

4611
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
And effectively,

4612
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
you know,

4613
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:34,000
we,

4614
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
we don't want to spoil too much about the storyline overall,

4615
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
but effectively,

4616
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
obviously someone here,

4617
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:39,000
you know,

4618
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
the count is wanting to harness the power of the beast once again.

4619
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Um,

4620
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
and then we have the mysterious figure there who is saying,

4621
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:47,000
you know,

4622
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:48,000
uh,

4623
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:48,000
no,

4624
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,000
don't do this.

4625
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
This always turns out badly.

4626
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Uh,

4627
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:51,000
you know,

4628
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
comment in chat that I loved that was like,

4629
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
stop opening Eldritch boxes.

4630
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Exactly.

4631
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Exactly.

4632
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Why do people keep doing this?

4633
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Yeah.

4634
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Yeah.

4635
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I,

4636
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I would.

4637
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Yeah.

4638
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
If someone handed you a mysterious orb,

4639
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:05,000
wouldn't you press the button?

4640
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I mean,

4641
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I mean,

4642
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I'm going to try,

4643
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
but who knows how many hours it's going to take me.

4644
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Indeed.

4645
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Indeed.

4646
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
So,

4647
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:19,000
um,

4648
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
we had a fun moment earlier where you were watching it and you were like,

4649
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Oh,

4650
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
we really need to,

4651
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
need to rename that passive.

4652
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Cause he's a Karooey and,

4653
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
and it's a wolf.

4654
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
It's called a wolf.

4655
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Great wolf's howl.

4656
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Great wolf obviously being in it.

4657
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
So he went out there.

4658
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Is a mite history.

4659
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
You started telling him.

4660
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I stomped out of the room.

4661
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
And I was like,

4662
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
we need to rename that notable.

4663
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
He's Karooey.

4664
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:43,000
And then I was kindly reminded that actually he was,

4665
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:43,000
uh,

4666
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
an orphan who,

4667
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
uh,

4668
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
an orphan and was adopted by a isomite and raised.

4669
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
And so,

4670
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,000
yes,

4671
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
there is a mixture of Karooey and isomite background.

4672
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
And I was like,

4673
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
it works.

4674
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
You were wrong.

4675
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Fair enough.

4676
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I walked back in here or sad and yeah,

4677
02:03:59,000 --> 02:03:59,000
whatever.

4678
02:03:59,000 --> 02:03:59,000
My bad.

4679
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It's fine.

4680
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
The name is good.

4681
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
He looked so chastised when he came back in,

4682
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
but that just like points to,

4683
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
the fact that I feel like you're doing a lot more with the characters here.

4684
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
For sure.

4685
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
You even mentioned that ascendancy stuff is going to have an impact story wise.

4686
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
So,

4687
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:12,000
um,

4688
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:12,000
like with,

4689
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
that's why we just think a lot about this kind of stuff.

4690
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:15,000
So the,

4691
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:15,000
uh,

4692
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:15,000
the,

4693
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
the acolyte of,

4694
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
and I always get this name wrong.

4695
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,000
The acolyte of,

4696
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:18,000
is it Chalula?

4697
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Chayula.

4698
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Chayula.

4699
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:20,000
I always say this wrong.

4700
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Um,

4701
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:21,000
so,

4702
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:22,000
uh,

4703
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
the acolyte of Chayula,

4704
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:23,000
for example,

4705
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:24,000
um,

4706
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
so that we have this sort of storyline with the origins of the monks,

4707
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
where there's like an order of monks who,

4708
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:28,000
uh,

4709
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
worship a,

4710
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
uh,

4711
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
thing they call the dreamer.

4712
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:31,000
And,

4713
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:31,000
uh,

4714
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
the dreamer is actually,

4715
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
uh,

4716
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:33,000
uh,

4717
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Chayula.

4718
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
So,

4719
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:35,000
um,

4720
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
and they don't know this.

4721
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
They're effectively worshiping a breach demon.

4722
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:38,000
So,

4723
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:38,000
uh,

4724
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
the acolyte of Chayula is effectively you embracing the fact that I'm

4725
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
worshiping a breach demon.

4726
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I'm just going to go all the way.

4727
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:44,000
And,

4728
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:44,000
uh,

4729
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
you know,

4730
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I'm in too deep now.

4731
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Yeah,

4732
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
exactly.

4733
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:46,000
We're just gonna,

4734
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
we're just gonna do it.

4735
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
So,

4736
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,000
uh,

4737
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,000
yeah,

4738
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
there's a lot of thinking like that that goes into these things.

4739
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Like,

4740
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:50,000
you know,

4741
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
what is the history of these people?

4742
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Like,

4743
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:52,000
you know,

4744
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
because I think a lot of that stuff inspires,

4745
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,000
uh,

4746
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
interesting mechanics as well.

4747
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:56,000
So,

4748
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:56,000
for example,

4749
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
on that one,

4750
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
you've got that into the breach skill,

4751
02:04:59,000 --> 02:04:59,000
which kind of means,

4752
02:04:59,000 --> 02:04:59,000
you know,

4753
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
you're always in a breach all the time.

4754
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
You can see the like,

4755
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:01,000
you know,

4756
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
things going on like that.

4757
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:03,000
That stuff is,

4758
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
I think that just,

4759
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
there's a lot of cool inspiration there.

4760
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:05,000
So,

4761
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
uh,

4762
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,000
coming up with that storyline stuff,

4763
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
um,

4764
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:08,000
for,

4765
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
for that stuff,

4766
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:09,000
just,

4767
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I think just,

4768
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:10,000
yeah,

4769
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
there's a couple other little,

4770
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
little things that I think is cool as well.

4771
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
And hopefully people will notice and pay attention to.

4772
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:19,000
So there's one of the bosses that was shown as,

4773
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:19,000
uh,

4774
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
uses a lot of time or chronomancy.

4775
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:22,000
And,

4776
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:22,000
um,

4777
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:30,000
you are a sorceress and you ascend to chronomancy and you then go to fight that boss.

4778
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Um,

4779
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,000
if you,

4780
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:31,000
for example,

4781
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
try to use time freeze,

4782
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:33,000
uh,

4783
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:34,000
the boss is like,

4784
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
yeah,

4785
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:35,000
there are,

4786
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:35,000
no,

4787
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
that doesn't work on me.

4788
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
And there's a dialogue line.

4789
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
And if you cast temporal chains on them,

4790
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:40,000
he's like,

4791
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:41,000
you know,

4792
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
just puts it back on you.

4793
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
And it's like,

4794
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,000
yeah.

4795
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
And so there's interesting things like that.

4796
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
And it doesn't like change things on a grand scale,

4797
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
right?

4798
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
It doesn't make a certain class not viable or anything like that.

4799
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,000
But there's this interesting little quirks and quips everywhere.

4800
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Different bosses have different intro lines,

4801
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
depending on what class you're playing.

4802
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Um,

4803
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
they have different skill lines sometimes,

4804
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
depending on what class you're playing.

4805
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Yeah.

4806
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Um,

4807
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
we've got different dialogue all through the campaign for different classes,

4808
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
like the,

4809
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:05,000
um,

4810
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
the sorceress was obviously from the Mariketh.

4811
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
When she goes back to the Mariketh,

4812
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
there's kind of a little backstory there about how she was banished originally.

4813
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Um,

4814
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:12,000
so,

4815
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:12,000
you know,

4816
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
she needs to find a way that,

4817
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:13,000
you know,

4818
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
to be,

4819
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
she needs to be accepted back into their culture again.

4820
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Uh,

4821
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000
you know,

4822
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
like we've got things like,

4823
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:17,000
uh,

4824
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
you know,

4825
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
the character we talked about earlier.

4826
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Um,

4827
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
so the warrior,

4828
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:20,000
you know,

4829
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
was an orphan.

4830
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Um,

4831
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
you know,

4832
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:22,000
he,

4833
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
uh,

4834
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,000
he was brought up by actually one of the NPCs in act one town.

4835
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
So obviously there's a whole different dialogue there because he's effectively,

4836
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
his adopted son,

4837
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:29,000
you know,

4838
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
we've got things like that.

4839
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Um,

4840
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:31,000
there's,

4841
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
there's a lot of thought that's gone into,

4842
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
you know,

4843
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
just trying to make it feel like all these character classes have some level of

4844
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
involvement with the world,

4845
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:37,000
you know,

4846
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
that didn't just come into existence the moment that you.

4847
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:40,000
There's,

4848
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:40,000
um,

4849
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
other little things.

4850
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,000
So like more on the narrative side,

4851
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:43,000
you,

4852
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
obviously we saw the world map,

4853
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,000
you have the icons that show different things that are in each act,

4854
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
like all the things you want to explore,

4855
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
find and,

4856
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:50,000
yeah,

4857
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
awesome.

4858
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,000
But each of them also has a little bit of a kind of little bit of text on them,

4859
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
as well.

4860
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,000
And like,

4861
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:57,000
for example,

4862
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
the,

4863
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,000
um,

4864
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
there's one in one of the first areas in the game.

4865
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
That's just like a camp of iron count guards.

4866
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,000
And,

4867
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,000
um,

4868
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:06,000
you know,

4869
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
we showed it in a trailer when the,

4870
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
when the Ranger class trailer we did,

4871
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:10,000
um,

4872
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:11,000
you know,

4873
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
whenever it was,

4874
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
you saw the Ranger shoot some of the,

4875
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,000
kill some of them because they were trying to like hurt a child,

4876
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:17,000
you know,

4877
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:22,000
and the child was just trying to get some food and the Ranger just like snipes them

4878
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
with arrows and kills them ruthlessly.

4879
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
And so you read this thing and you're like,

4880
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:25,000
you know,

4881
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,000
you hear whispers of an iron count,

4882
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
you know,

4883
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:29,000
uh,

4884
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:32,000
scouting party that was slain by a rogue archer or something like that.

4885
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
So you get these little things where we like connecting a lot of little dots.

4886
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
And even that you absorb a little bit of interesting little information.

4887
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Um,

4888
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
you've got other things,

4889
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
for example,

4890
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
when you enter an area,

4891
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,000
it don't,

4892
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
not only says the name at the top.

4893
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Now it has a,

4894
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
almost a subtitle text.

4895
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
That's giving you a little bit,

4896
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
a little bit of history.

4897
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
These little things like somehow make the world building feel so much better.

4898
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:55,000
And when you approach certain landmark rooms and you walk into them,

4899
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
you'll get a banner at the top as well,

4900
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
which says what it is and gives again,

4901
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
a little bit of a thing.

4902
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
And all these little micro,

4903
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
uh,

4904
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
narrative delivery mechanisms,

4905
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:07,000
like make you feel way more immersed in the world and way more aware of what's

4906
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
going on and way more connected to your character,

4907
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
way more connected to the bosses,

4908
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
to the NPCs.

4909
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Um,

4910
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
it's,

4911
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
yeah,

4912
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
there's a lot we're doing now that we certainly never did before.

4913
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
We didn't even think of before.

4914
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Um,

4915
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:19,000
but yeah,

4916
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,000
it's,

4917
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:20,000
it's,

4918
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I like that a lot.

4919
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Cause like as an action RPG gamer,

4920
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
I don't really care too much about plot,

4921
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:29,000
but I do want a really cool world to be blowing monsters up in.

4922
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Basically that's like,

4923
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I want the characters to be cool.

4924
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I want the baddies to be cool.

4925
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
And I want like the things happening around me that like,

4926
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:35,000
in,

4927
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
you know,

4928
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
build out a bit of that story without me having to stop killing stuff.

4929
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Yeah.

4930
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
And it sounds like there's more of that going on as well,

4931
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:42,000
which is great.

4932
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
There's the baddies being cool.

4933
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:44,000
I mean,

4934
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:49,000
that's how we almost designed an ascendancy class in here just before when we

4935
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
were watching that trailer earlier.

4936
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
So what you were,

4937
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
you were saying a shadow,

4938
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
you came up with a shadow ascendancy.

4939
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Yeah.

4940
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Yeah.

4941
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:57,000
We were,

4942
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:57,000
well,

4943
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
internally we had some developers watching the trailer yesterday,

4944
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
getting excited about,

4945
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
and then I was like,

4946
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I want to play that.

4947
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I want to play that character.

4948
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I want to be that character.

4949
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
That's awesome.

4950
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
That like kind of Val Thormaturge type character.

4951
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
And so like,

4952
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:12,000
cool.

4953
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
All of a sudden it's like,

4954
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
we should make that a class.

4955
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
And then we had another guy like suggest it should be a shadow.

4956
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:18,000
And so now I'm like,

4957
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Oh yeah,

4958
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:19,000
we're definitely,

4959
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
come on.

4960
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
We have to do a Val Thormaturge shadow ascendancy.

4961
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Like that's going to be cool.

4962
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
And you can do awesome things now.

4963
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Even when I,

4964
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I know it's hard to see because you hide it under all the armor,

4965
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
but you can do things like,

4966
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:31,000
you know,

4967
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:32,000
with our character classes,

4968
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
just due to the upgrades and models,

4969
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:39,000
where all of a sudden now the character can have tattoos added to them and stuff like that is completely feasible in the future.

4970
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:40,000
And like,

4971
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I would,

4972
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I want to do a lot more of that stuff.

4973
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Like for the,

4974
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
there's little things that for the war bringer,

4975
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
I think was the class name on the warrior.

4976
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,000
When you take that ancestral totem node,

4977
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,000
all your totems now have like an extra blue glow to them,

4978
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
kind of like they're enhanced by this ancestral magic.

4979
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,000
And what we also want to do is has,

4980
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,000
add tattoos as well that like glow blue when you're using certain skills and all that.

4981
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
So heaps of little things that again,

4982
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,000
connects all the culture and all that stuff together and make you feel like,

4983
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:07,000
you know,

4984
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
it's believable as opposed to,

4985
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
and this is a character as opposed to,

4986
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
this is just a mechanic.

4987
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:12,000
And,

4988
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:12,000
you know,

4989
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
it makes picking an ascendancy more epic.

4990
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I know that there was a part in the trailer that was like not fully finished where you ascend and it doesn't really do anything,

4991
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,000
but I know you want it to be like a cool moment where some power goes.

4992
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Yeah,

4993
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
absolutely.

4994
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
We just hadn't finished the VFX yet.

4995
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Even the,

4996
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
uh,

4997
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:25,000
another one,

4998
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
the blood mage,

4999
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,000
when you like,

5000
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
you know,

5001
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,000
play the blood mage and now you can add a surge on your character.

5002
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Whenever you cast spells,

5003
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,000
you're getting like almost blood bending kind of vibe going on and like,

5004
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
drawing it from their veins and sending out a fireball.

5005
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:38,000
It's cool.

5006
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Yeah.

5007
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
It's real cool.

5008
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Yeah.

5009
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
You can have like the tattoos get tattooed on them as they,

5010
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
as they ascend and things like that.

5011
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I mean,

5012
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
that just makes taking an ascendancy way more cool,

5013
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,000
which is,

5014
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:47,000
it's already,

5015
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I think I almost feel like ascendancy is more important than the classes for

5016
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,000
players kind of like feeling the vibe of what they want to do with their

5017
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:55,000
character.

5018
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,000
For sure.

5019
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Cause I,

5020
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I mean,

5021
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
the classes are pretty open.

5022
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
You can play whatever skills,

5023
02:10:59,000 --> 02:10:59,000
whatever weapon.

5024
02:10:59,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Sure.

5025
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
You're on a passive tree at a start point,

5026
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:01,000
but you know,

5027
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
by high level,

5028
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
you kind of go wherever you want to go using jewels,

5029
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
especially getting off class stuff.

5030
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
You can kind of be whatever you want with the base class.

5031
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Yeah.

5032
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:09,000
So eventually,

5033
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:10,000
yeah,

5034
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
the ascendancy is what becomes more of that important identity.

5035
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Feature.

5036
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Cause that's what you have actually chosen.

5037
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
That makes you distinct.

5038
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,000
That another different class wouldn't be able to actually have.

5039
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:21,000
So,

5040
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:21,000
yeah.

5041
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Yeah.

5042
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
So you want to make that super,

5043
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:23,000
super cool.

5044
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
And on that note,

5045
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I,

5046
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I know I was definitely confused.

5047
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
I know people were definitely confused and a little worried about ascendancy

5048
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
and what's happening with that.

5049
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
And people were like watching the,

5050
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,000
like the second trial and being like,

5051
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Oh,

5052
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
what if I don't like this?

5053
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Oh,

5054
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
it's just another lab again.

5055
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:39,000
And,

5056
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
but I want you to like lay it out as like simply as possible.

5057
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Like how,

5058
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:45,000
how do you ascend?

5059
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Yeah.

5060
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
So effectively in the full game,

5061
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
there's going to be three ascendancy trials for early access.

5062
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
There's two.

5063
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
And effectively you can use any of those ascendancy trials to be able to do

5064
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:54,000
your ascension.

5065
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:55,000
You choose.

5066
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Yeah.

5067
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:56,000
You choose which one.

5068
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
And effectively if you,

5069
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
as you get to higher level,

5070
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
like higher level keys for those trials,

5071
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
that will unlock more points.

5072
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Like if you do it at a certain level break points,

5073
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
that will allow you to get more points for those classes.

5074
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
So if you want to just play the entire,

5075
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:10,000
just,

5076
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,000
just only the trial of the chaos God with,

5077
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
you know,

5078
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:14,000
to get all your points,

5079
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
then you can just decide to do that.

5080
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Just play at a higher and higher levels and you get more points as you go

5081
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:18,000
through.

5082
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
You know,

5083
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:19,000
if you want to do a mix,

5084
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
that's fine too.

5085
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Personally,

5086
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
I think people will want to try out all the different content.

5087
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:23,000
I mean,

5088
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
you might think that you,

5089
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
but even within the trials,

5090
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
there's,

5091
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:27,000
there's choices,

5092
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:27,000
right?

5093
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Like I know that there's always contention around traps,

5094
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
but because in the,

5095
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,000
because in the trial of the Sekimers,

5096
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
you can choose which rooms you want to go to.

5097
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:38,000
If you don't want to deal with traps,

5098
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
you just don't pick those rooms,

5099
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:39,000
right?

5100
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Like,

5101
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
don't go to the gauntlet rooms.

5102
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
You can just go to other things.

5103
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Do the combat ones.

5104
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Do the combat ones and that's fine too.

5105
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
So effectively it's like,

5106
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
you always get to choose like what you're doing there.

5107
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Like,

5108
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
it's funny because like,

5109
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:50,000
I know traps are so contentious,

5110
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
but also there are other people who just enjoy that stuff.

5111
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:52,000
So,

5112
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:52,000
you know,

5113
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
you want to have something for all those people too.

5114
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
there's these like path of exile,

5115
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
divisive content,

5116
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,000
but lots of choice and you can choose what to do and what not to do.

5117
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,000
And then we're embracing that here now.

5118
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
And that is clearly leaning into that.

5119
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Now you have,

5120
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
you have,

5121
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:05,000
I mean,

5122
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:09,000
such a competitive advantage in that you have so much content and even with Peewee 2,

5123
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
that's still going to be the case.

5124
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
So you can lean into that,

5125
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
like making content that is spicier,

5126
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
but divisive.

5127
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:15,000
For sure.

5128
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:21,000
And now you're like separating trees and having these things be a little able to be focused on a lot more.

5129
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,000
And you're doing that with the trials,

5130
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:24,000
with the ascendancies.

5131
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:25,000
So,

5132
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,000
and you can like,

5133
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,000
you can kind of do all of them and drip feed yourself smaller.

5134
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,000
And there's also stuff that you're going to be getting from those like specific rewards and everything that might incentivize you to do that.

5135
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
But of course,

5136
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,000
on the other hand,

5137
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
if you don't want to do that content,

5138
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:38,000
we have open,

5139
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:39,000
full open trade,

5140
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:39,000
right?

5141
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
You can just trade for the rewards and that's fine too.

5142
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:42,000
So,

5143
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
you know,

5144
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
like that's always part of the,

5145
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:44,000
yes.

5146
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Like the rewards there,

5147
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
for example,

5148
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
like jewels drop throughout the world.

5149
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
But if you want to get more jewels,

5150
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:52,000
you go and run Sanctum.

5151
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Now,

5152
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,000
if you want to get the radius jewels,

5153
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:54,000
you,

5154
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:54,000
you,

5155
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:54,000
you,

5156
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
well,

5157
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Sanctum,

5158
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
I can't,

5159
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
it's a trial of the second mode.

5160
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:00,000
So just for anyone who isn't a Path of Exile 1 player,

5161
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,000
this is effectively a sequel to Sanctum League that we did in Path of Exile 1.

5162
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
So it's mechanically very similar,

5163
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
but it's obviously,

5164
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:07,000
you know,

5165
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:08,000
America,

5166
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
you know,

5167
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
like America trial now,

5168
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:11,000
and,

5169
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:11,000
you know,

5170
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:11,000
we've changed it.

5171
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,000
A lot of things about it have changed and all like the content is new,

5172
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
but it is effectively the same overall mechanic,

5173
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
you know,

5174
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
in terms of that sort of roguelike mechanic that we have.

5175
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
And it's the same with the other one.

5176
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
You have ultimatum and POE 1 being the theme.

5177
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
And of course now it's redesigned and it's evolved into a trial of,

5178
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
of chaos.

5179
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
So yeah,

5180
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
a lot of people in chat would have been spamming ultimatum.

5181
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
And for those who haven't played,

5182
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:33,000
we'd probably be like,

5183
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:34,000
what?

5184
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
I don't understand.

5185
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Yeah.

5186
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Effectively,

5187
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:40,000
the trial of the cast of chaos is a sequel to ultimatum,

5188
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
which is,

5189
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
and we just have to get used to the new names,

5190
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
which is very hard.

5191
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
But yeah,

5192
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:46,000
anyway,

5193
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
the point being,

5194
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:47,000
of course,

5195
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
and Val orbs drop in the world as well.

5196
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
And if you want a larger dose of Val orbs and,

5197
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
you know,

5198
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,000
you don't want to trade,

5199
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
go feel free to run some ultimatums.

5200
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Thing is,

5201
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
cause they're all item generated keys as well.

5202
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
It's not like you have to do it right then and there.

5203
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
You can trade the keys away.

5204
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
At any point you can also buy more keys if you want to farm more of that

5205
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:06,000
thing.

5206
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,000
And if you just want to do it later,

5207
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
just stockpile a bunch of them,

5208
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:10,000
run them all at your,

5209
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:11,000
at your leisure.

5210
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
You know what I mean?

5211
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
It's like you have the freedom.

5212
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
They are itemized,

5213
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
tradable as,

5214
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
as a lot in path of exile tradition,

5215
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:19,000
but as,

5216
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:20,000
as is everything,

5217
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:20,000
right?

5218
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
We don't,

5219
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:21,000
the only,

5220
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
the only thing you can't trade is gold.

5221
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,000
So we're like the exact opposite of most games where it's like the gold is

5222
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
freely tradable and the items get locked.

5223
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:28,000
We're like,

5224
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:32,000
the gold is the only thing you can't trade and every other item is free and

5225
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:32,000
open.

5226
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Yeah.

5227
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,000
And that's because you've made gold be this like way to be like,

5228
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
you're playing the game.

5229
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:38,000
So you have access to this.

5230
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:38,000
And absolutely.

5231
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
You don't want to trade that away.

5232
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Effectively.

5233
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Yeah.

5234
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Um,

5235
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
so how,

5236
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:43,000
uh,

5237
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
on the ascendancies and the trials,

5238
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,000
how hard do you foresee getting your ascendancy to be while leveling?

5239
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Do you expect people to fail out and attempt these things multiple times?

5240
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
And what does that look like if you do?

5241
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Well,

5242
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I failed the first time I did this.

5243
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,000
It is important to know that that first itemized key,

5244
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
um,

5245
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,000
is a quest key.

5246
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,000
And we have special rules around it that if you do fail,

5247
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
you can just repeat it,

5248
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:04,000
right?

5249
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
You changed that recently because,

5250
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:06,000
uh,

5251
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
that was something that I didn't actually realize you'd changed.

5252
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Uh,

5253
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
I guess it was a little bit too harsh to require to get in,

5254
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:11,000
another one.

5255
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Yeah.

5256
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
You weren't the only one failing it.

5257
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Yeah.

5258
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Um,

5259
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:15,000
but,

5260
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:15,000
uh,

5261
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
yeah,

5262
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
so pretty much you get to reattempt it.

5263
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,000
And,

5264
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:18,000
um,

5265
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:18,000
you know,

5266
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,000
for something like ultimatum,

5267
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
you know,

5268
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
you know,

5269
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
just to immediately start thinking of exploits.

5270
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:23,000
It's like,

5271
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
I can just do three of the waves,

5272
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
then intentionally fail and then repeat them.

5273
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Well,

5274
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
we've thought of that.

5275
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Don't worry.

5276
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,000
You can't.

5277
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:29,000
But,

5278
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
um,

5279
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:30,000
yeah,

5280
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
the first ones are repeatable.

5281
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
You're not going to be like,

5282
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
you know,

5283
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Oh,

5284
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,000
what the heck now I have to just play to the whims of random generation to

5285
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
ascend like that.

5286
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Yeah.

5287
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:38,000
So it is,

5288
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I certainly don't think you'll do it on your first attempt.

5289
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Um,

5290
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I did not to brag.

5291
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:45,000
You did?

5292
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
I did.

5293
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:46,000
I did pass.

5294
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
I was clenched though.

5295
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Yeah.

5296
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Okay.

5297
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Yeah.

5298
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Especially in that boss fight.

5299
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I was watching,

5300
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
I was watching him do the boss fight.

5301
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
You came by right as I was doing the boss fight.

5302
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,000
But you had some like kind of powerful boons there to be perfectly honest.

5303
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
I got 60% move speed.

5304
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Yeah.

5305
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
That was part of my strategic choice.

5306
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I was watching you from,

5307
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I'm like,

5308
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,000
how is he so fast?

5309
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
This isn't the peewee too we just lied.

5310
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I was like,

5311
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
what was Dodger?

5312
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
I was going across half the arena.

5313
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
This game is supposed to be slow.

5314
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:10,000
No.

5315
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
So yeah,

5316
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:12,000
it was good.

5317
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
It was good fun.

5318
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I quite liked it.

5319
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
I'm,

5320
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I like mostly like Sanctum.

5321
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I'd not,

5322
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I don't want to do it all the time,

5323
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
but I did quite like the trial of Sekima,

5324
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
but knowing that there's other choices,

5325
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
so I can do ultimatum instead or something like that.

5326
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:24,000
It's fun.

5327
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:24,000
100%.

5328
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
So you've got these,

5329
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,000
you've got these like two roguelike dungeons that are going into the beta

5330
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:28,000
that launch,

5331
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
but they've done very differently.

5332
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
One's got the honor system,

5333
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
which is like a separate health,

5334
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
but it's based on and scaled by your health,

5335
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
which I noted is quite interesting.

5336
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
And your defenses now,

5337
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
it can be fully mitigated and everything.

5338
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Fully scaled by your character.

5339
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
You go in in a tanky character,

5340
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
you'll be tanky in the dungeon,

5341
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:42,000
which is really cool.

5342
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
And then with ultimatum,

5343
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
and just because people will ask,

5344
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:46,000
in ultimatum,

5345
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
there aren't any traps.

5346
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Yes.

5347
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
No traps in ultimatum

5348
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
and no honor system in ultimatum.

5349
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,000
If you just want more of a pure combat experience,

5350
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
then that's your choice.

5351
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
And then there's going to be a third one as well,

5352
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
which is secret for now.

5353
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
So once act four goes in,

5354
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,000
then we'll have a third trial.

5355
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,000
So, you know,

5356
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
people sort of broadly know that the crew are in act four.

5357
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
So it's the question of how would the crew ascend

5358
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
is the question there.

5359
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Yes.

5360
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,000
And if there's any other things that have been called trials

5361
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
associated with the crew at some point in the past

5362
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
and how likely that is to be related.

5363
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I'm just thinking now,

5364
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
we're just thinking of that Vile Thormaturge class before,

5365
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
and I'm already thinking,

5366
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:22,000
like,

5367
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:22,000
oh,

5368
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
it'd be so cool if you ascend in ultimatum.

5369
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,000
We want the trial master to say different lines to you

5370
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:27,000
because you're,

5371
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:27,000
like,

5372
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
choosing the way of the Vile.

5373
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I'm just,

5374
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I'm,

5375
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:30,000
you can't,

5376
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
I can't stop thinking about all this stuff.

5377
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
I did hear a few of his lines

5378
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
in some of the gameplay Jonathan was showing me.

5379
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
It was quite good.

5380
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I love,

5381
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
I love that he's back,

5382
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
the trial master.

5383
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Yeah,

5384
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,000
he's cool.

5385
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
A little salty sometimes that you're taking this power,

5386
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,000
it seems.

5387
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:44,000
So,

5388
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
we have,

5389
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
we have the unique rewards from each of them.

5390
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:48,000
We got like the,

5391
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:49,000
like you said,

5392
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,000
the jewels are global,

5393
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
but there are unique jewels,

5394
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,000
and then there are,

5395
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,000
um,

5396
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
unique socketables from the other one.

5397
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Yep.

5398
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:57,000
And is it,

5399
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,000
there's something planned to be unique from the final third trial

5400
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:00,000
that will be added later?

5401
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Of course.

5402
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Uh,

5403
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:03,000
yes,

5404
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
there is already.

5405
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I know what they,

5406
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I'm not going to say it,

5407
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:06,000
don't worry.

5408
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Keep some secrets.

5409
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Fine then.

5410
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Again,

5411
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
again,

5412
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I value the discovery,

5413
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:12,000
right?

5414
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,000
I'm certainly,

5415
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
if I accidentally say it,

5416
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,000
it is certainly by mistake.

5417
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:17,000
But yes,

5418
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:17,000
don't.

5419
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:20,000
And that Vile Orbs from the ultimatum in particular,

5420
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:21,000
um,

5421
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
is,

5422
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
they seem like they're a lot more important,

5423
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
a lot more powerful.

5424
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I mean,

5425
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I certainly think that like,

5426
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
some of the stuff is a lot better with how they work.

5427
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:30,000
So,

5428
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:31,000
um,

5429
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:31,000
yeah.

5430
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:35,000
So one of the things that we wanted to change was that implicits on items are truly implicit.

5431
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Like you can't get rid of them.

5432
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:36,000
They stay there.

5433
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,000
And so that means that when you do a Vile,

5434
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:39,000
uh,

5435
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:39,000
a Vile Orbs,

5436
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,000
the mod that you get there now is an addition to whatever implicit already had,

5437
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:43,000
um,

5438
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
which is obviously good.

5439
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,000
And then the next one being that,

5440
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:45,000
yeah,

5441
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:45,000
you can get plus,

5442
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
plus one socket above the normal limit,

5443
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:48,000
um,

5444
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:48,000
which is,

5445
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
uh,

5446
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:49,000
you know,

5447
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
also kind of powerful.

5448
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Um,

5449
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
so especially with the soul cause.

5450
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
So in,

5451
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:53,000
um,

5452
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
in,

5453
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:54,000
in,

5454
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:54,000
in the,

5455
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
uh,

5456
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
trial of the trial of chaos,

5457
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:57,000
you,

5458
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:58,000
uh,

5459
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:58,000
get,

5460
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:58,000
uh,

5461
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
soul cause that you can't get from anywhere else.

5462
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:01,000
And those effectively are,

5463
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:01,000
uh,

5464
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
mods that are typically a bit beyond what you would normally get,

5465
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:04,000
um,

5466
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,000
uh,

5467
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,000
like in,

5468
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:06,000
on regular items.

5469
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Um,

5470
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
whereas runes,

5471
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
which kind of drop everywhere,

5472
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
those ones are just kind of normal everyday mods that you would expect to find.

5473
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Resists and things like that.

5474
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Yeah,

5475
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,000
just resists and damage and that kind of stuff.

5476
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
So effectively the soul cause is,

5477
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:16,000
um,

5478
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:16,000
you know,

5479
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
is,

5480
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:17,000
is,

5481
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
is kind of the more end gamey,

5482
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:19,000
uh,

5483
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
socketables that you might want to be using.

5484
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:21,000
And,

5485
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:21,000
um,

5486
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
yeah,

5487
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
obviously being able to get,

5488
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:23,000
um,

5489
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:23,000
plus one socket,

5490
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:23,000
I mean,

5491
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
it's something that everyone will want.

5492
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Um,

5493
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
but on the other hand,

5494
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
there is that risk of,

5495
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:28,000
uh,

5496
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:28,000
you know,

5497
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
just bricking your item.

5498
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:30,000
So,

5499
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:30,000
uh,

5500
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
you know,

5501
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:31,000
that's a,

5502
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,000
the deadly gamble you have as your final crafting step there.

5503
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
It's what they are.

5504
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Val orbs are more forgiving though.

5505
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:37,000
They are.

5506
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Yeah.

5507
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:38,000
But like,

5508
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:38,000
you know,

5509
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
if you think about,

5510
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:40,000
um,

5511
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:40,000
we,

5512
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,000
we talked about enchantment.

5513
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Yeah.

5514
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,000
So some slots you might value the enchantment over a rune or a socket slot,

5515
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:45,000
right?

5516
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
That probably,

5517
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
especially towards end game,

5518
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I'd say that's probably going to tilt that way because,

5519
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,000
you know,

5520
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:50,000
well,

5521
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
maybe a soul core contests with it,

5522
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:52,000
but you know,

5523
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,000
the whole point is that there's,

5524
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:54,000
you know,

5525
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,000
choice there involved,

5526
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:56,000
um,

5527
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,000
you know,

5528
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:57,000
and then there,

5529
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
so there's enchantment.

5530
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
We just talked about the socket.

5531
02:20:59,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Um,

5532
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
there's obviously always the case of doing nothing,

5533
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
um,

5534
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
which happens,

5535
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
but you know,

5536
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:04,000
for,

5537
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
um,

5538
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,000
just say regular rare items,

5539
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
uh,

5540
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:13,000
it will re-roll like one to three modifiers at ran effectively do a chaos orb on one to three modifiers,

5541
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,000
not all six.

5542
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
And as much as that can often be a downside,

5543
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
because if you're using on a very good item,

5544
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,000
um,

5545
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
obviously it's going to take away the good ones.

5546
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Um,

5547
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
but if you're using it on a mid item,

5548
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
you can actually turn it very good.

5549
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Now I've had this happen.

5550
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Like I,

5551
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
when I've been playing,

5552
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:28,000
I've got like,

5553
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:28,000
ah,

5554
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
it's just,

5555
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:29,000
you know,

5556
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,000
life defense,

5557
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,000
defense,

5558
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
double res,

5559
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
and something else that I don't want.

5560
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:34,000
And,

5561
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:35,000
um,

5562
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I'm like,

5563
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:35,000
ah,

5564
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
I'll just start valing everything.

5565
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Cause why not?

5566
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
You know,

5567
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I've got my val orbs and I val it and it re-rolls that bottom mod into a tri-res,

5568
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
and now I've got a tri-res,

5569
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
double defense,

5570
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:43,000
life helmet.

5571
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:44,000
And I was like,

5572
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:44,000
yo,

5573
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:45,000
awesome.

5574
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,000
So even that,

5575
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
which is,

5576
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
can often be perceived as a bad outcome.

5577
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Now it isn't going to completely break your item.

5578
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:51,000
And so,

5579
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:52,000
for example,

5580
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
if you have a weapon,

5581
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
you know,

5582
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
you've got your three damage mods,

5583
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
um,

5584
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
and you've got some bad suffixes,

5585
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
it could even be an option,

5586
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:58,000
you know,

5587
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
like,

5588
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:02,000
or hopefully it doesn't just remove all three damage mods,

5589
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:02,000
you know,

5590
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
whereas before it's like,

5591
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
if it bricked it,

5592
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:07,000
it often was almost always a brick,

5593
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:07,000
right?

5594
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Like that item is now dead.

5595
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:09,000
So.

5596
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
And then you told me about a new unique,

5597
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
uh,

5598
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:12,000
yeah,

5599
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:12,000
result,

5600
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
which I don't know if you want to spoil it.

5601
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:15,000
100%.

5602
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Yeah.

5603
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Yeah.

5604
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:16,000
It's cool.

5605
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
It's so cool.

5606
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I'm surprised you even got that pass with that one pass,

5607
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Rishi,

5608
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:20,000
honestly.

5609
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I mean,

5610
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
he got it made.

5611
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Okay.

5612
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Great.

5613
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,000
We discussed it.

5614
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,000
I,

5615
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:25,000
I,

5616
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:25,000
I,

5617
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
you know,

5618
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I agree.

5619
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
I messaged it to him thinking he'll be like,

5620
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:28,000
no way,

5621
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
this is unacceptable.

5622
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
He was,

5623
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,000
he was all for it.

5624
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
It didn't turn into a dexterity chat.

5625
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:34,000
And so,

5626
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:34,000
um,

5627
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:35,000
yeah.

5628
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Um,

5629
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:36,000
pretty,

5630
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:39,000
what it effectively does is it just takes the mod values and it multiple,

5631
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
it,

5632
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,000
it,

5633
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
it goes up to,

5634
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
uh,

5635
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,000
I can't remember exactly the values,

5636
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,000
but let's just say it's,

5637
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:44,000
it,

5638
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:44,000
um,

5639
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:50,000
it changes all the values to between 0.8 and 1.2 of what they were multiplied,

5640
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
but it doesn't care about the minimum and maximums.

5641
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
So for example,

5642
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
if you had a thousand life calms heart,

5643
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,000
you can use this to get,

5644
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,000
again,

5645
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:00,000
this is me assuming it's 20% variance,

5646
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
but I,

5647
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
cause I can't remember what we balanced it to,

5648
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
but you'll be able to get a 1200 life calms heart,

5649
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
for example.

5650
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Now that's obviously giving up the enchantment and a socket.

5651
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Um,

5652
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
just thinking about sockets on calms heart.

5653
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I can't remember what we did,

5654
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:11,000
but whatever.

5655
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Um,

5656
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I think you can actually,

5657
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
uh,

5658
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:15,000
do that,

5659
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
which is interesting,

5660
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:16,000
but,

5661
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:17,000
um,

5662
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
uh,

5663
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
ultimately it's like,

5664
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:19,000
yeah,

5665
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,000
now I'm choosing,

5666
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:20,000
am I,

5667
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,000
do I want the enchantment?

5668
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Do I want an extra,

5669
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,000
you know,

5670
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
100 something,

5671
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
200 life,

5672
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
whatever that ends up being?

5673
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Um,

5674
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
or do I want the socket?

5675
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Um,

5676
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,000
so it's quite an interesting choice and adds an extra access of corruption to unique items.

5677
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,000
That is,

5678
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I think,

5679
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
corrupted divining of uniques.

5680
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Yeah.

5681
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Yeah.

5682
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Effectively.

5683
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Yeah.

5684
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:39,000
It's divining them,

5685
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
but with,

5686
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:40,000
um,

5687
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
higher maximums and lower minimums.

5688
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Surely there's going to be some broken things like max res or something like that.

5689
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I mean,

5690
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:46,000
we'll guess we'll find out.

5691
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Cross that bridge when it comes to it.

5692
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Yeah.

5693
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
It's fine.

5694
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
So that was all just talking about the trials,

5695
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,000
how you actually get your ascendancies,

5696
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
but what about the actual ascendancies themselves?

5697
02:23:59,000 --> 02:23:59,000
How are they,

5698
02:23:59,000 --> 02:23:59,000
uh,

5699
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:00,000
how are they cooking?

5700
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Um,

5701
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
well,

5702
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:04,000
they're fun.

5703
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
They're cool.

5704
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Yeah.

5705
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Um,

5706
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,000
we certainly try to get,

5707
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
what we've tried to do is for the,

5708
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:09,000
the class,

5709
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
we've tried to have one that's a bit more out there.

5710
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Yeah.

5711
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:12,000
You know,

5712
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:13,000
something that isn't just,

5713
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:13,000
you know,

5714
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
like if you think even about in Pee Wee One,

5715
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
you've got the dualist,

5716
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
you can go like champion or slayer or,

5717
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:20,000
um,

5718
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,000
holy words.

5719
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I don't remember,

5720
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I don't remember,

5721
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:22,000
but you know,

5722
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:22,000
the drill,

5723
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:23,000
um,

5724
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:24,000
and the,

5725
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,000
oh,

5726
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:25,000
gladiator.

5727
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,000
And the problem is like,

5728
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:27,000
okay,

5729
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:30,000
they're all just about like hitting stuff with weapons and they haven't,

5730
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
there's nothing really out there.

5731
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:32,000
They,

5732
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:32,000
they,

5733
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:32,000
sure,

5734
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
they,

5735
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:33,000
they all sound cool.

5736
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Like don't get me wrong.

5737
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
And they can be cool and they do have differences,

5738
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
but there's nothing that's like kind of crazy.

5739
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Um,

5740
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,000
so all of a sudden now when you're like,

5741
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:41,000
you know,

5742
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
sorceress,

5743
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,000
you're using all your elemental skills and now you can just like go into this

5744
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,000
thing that can stop time.

5745
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:46,000
You know,

5746
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
it's a little bit more,

5747
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
uh,

5748
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,000
crazy.

5749
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:49,000
And you've got the,

5750
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:54,000
the mercenary and you can turn into a gemling legionnaire and effectively fuse

5751
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,000
gems into your flesh to like,

5752
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:56,000
you know,

5753
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,000
mutate yourself.

5754
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:58,000
You know,

5755
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:01,000
it's like not just talking about crossbows and projectiles over and over and over

5756
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,000
and over again.

5757
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
It's like doing kind of whack stuff.

5758
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
So I really like that.

5759
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:06,000
That's awesome.

5760
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
And we're going to make sure every single class has one thing that is like

5761
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,000
definitely out there.

5762
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Um,

5763
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:12,000
and then one thing that's,

5764
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:12,000
you know,

5765
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,000
more predictable,

5766
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
more to the expectation of the trope,

5767
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:15,000
you know,

5768
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,000
for example,

5769
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,000
the dead eye to the Ranger.

5770
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:18,000
And,

5771
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,000
um,

5772
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:19,000
but yeah,

5773
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:20,000
lots and lots of,

5774
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
uh,

5775
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
cool interactions,

5776
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,000
just cool and playing with different mechanics.

5777
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
And we've tried to make them like,

5778
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:26,000
for example,

5779
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
none of them call out a weapon,

5780
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:29,000
right?

5781
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:30,000
None of them.

5782
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:30,000
So you,

5783
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
we're trying to make sure that they're broad.

5784
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:37,000
enough to be that you might be a Ranger going a dead eye,

5785
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
but playing a caster,

5786
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:39,000
right?

5787
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Playing spells,

5788
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
like keeping all of that open,

5789
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,000
that flexibility,

5790
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:43,000
that kind of crazy,

5791
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:44,000
you know,

5792
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,000
for the Johnny players,

5793
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,000
as we call it out there,

5794
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,000
who want to just completely experiment and figure out,

5795
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:49,000
you know,

5796
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,000
the most broken,

5797
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
weird stuff,

5798
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:52,000
you know,

5799
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
and you get things with that when you're still like,

5800
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:54,000
okay,

5801
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:54,000
okay,

5802
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I'm a Ranger.

5803
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Uh,

5804
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
and I'm using a Quill Rain in one weapon set,

5805
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
specced into a bunch of prod speed,

5806
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:01,000
attack speed.

5807
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
And in my second weapon set,

5808
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I'm using a spellcaster staff with a bunch of projectile stuff.

5809
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:08,000
And I'm invested into more spell damage side.

5810
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,000
And you've got a whack tree.

5811
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:09,000
And all of a sudden,

5812
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
now you're this like dead eye,

5813
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,000
archer,

5814
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,000
spellcaster,

5815
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:13,000
mage hybrid,

5816
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
doing all kinds of wacky stuff,

5817
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
or like even,

5818
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
or let's say the same build and experimenting with a bunch of triggers.

5819
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
And so you're using your bow as a,

5820
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,000
as Quill Rain,

5821
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:25,000
as a higher attack speed delivery mechanism for,

5822
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:25,000
you know,

5823
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:29,000
laying down a bunch of either CCs or slows,

5824
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
or building up crowd controls.

5825
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,000
And then you're using the caster stuff.

5826
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,000
And like,

5827
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
you get some pretty out there things going on.

5828
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
And the important thing is it's not like just like,

5829
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,000
uh,

5830
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,000
benefiting only arrows or only bow attacks or anything like that.

5831
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
It's broad.

5832
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:44,000
And now,

5833
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:45,000
you know,

5834
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
it opens up the world to what you can do and same like the,

5835
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:53,000
the gemling legionnaire on the mercenary is entirely just about gem slots,

5836
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:53,000
skills,

5837
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
support,

5838
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:54,000
et cetera.

5839
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,000
There's no,

5840
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,000
you don't have to be anything.

5841
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
You can be literally whatever build you want.

5842
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Um,

5843
02:26:59,000 --> 02:26:59,000
and yeah,

5844
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
so that,

5845
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
that's embracing that and making sure that people still,

5846
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,000
even though we have all these classes,

5847
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:04,000
you are,

5848
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:05,000
we're embracing that path of exile.

5849
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:09,000
You can do anything fantasy that we want people to be able to do.

5850
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
And yeah,

5851
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
if you don't want to go with the trope,

5852
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,000
perfectly fine.

5853
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Yeah.

5854
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,000
And you'll still be powerful.

5855
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
It sounds like you're really trying to avoid that thing that we've had a

5856
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:21,000
couple of times in POE one where like a certain niche is relegated to

5857
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,000
on ascendancy.

5858
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Like that's the only way to go for it.

5859
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
It sounds like that's not going to be the case here.

5860
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Well,

5861
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,000
at least if we're doing our job right,

5862
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,000
that should we,

5863
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:28,000
yeah.

5864
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:31,000
And with so many of the ascendancies as well,

5865
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:32,000
got a lot of choices.

5866
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Um,

5867
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,000
originally the plan was to like have all of the POE one ascendancies available

5868
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
and it was some sort of weird split campaign stuff and all that.

5869
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Uh,

5870
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,000
I don't really know at this point.

5871
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:42,000
It's a bit confusing.

5872
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:43,000
It's,

5873
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
you mentioned dead eye though.

5874
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,000
So it sounds like some of them are coming forwards,

5875
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
but is it all just being redone at this point?

5876
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:48,000
At this point,

5877
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:48,000
yeah,

5878
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:49,000
at this point they'll just be different,

5879
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
right?

5880
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Like originally way back when we were planning on just keeping the

5881
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:54,000
ascendancies as they were and putting them over.

5882
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
But at this point,

5883
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
um,

5884
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
that wouldn't even be a good enough because like,

5885
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:01,000
it doesn't fit the kind of like path of XL two way of designing this

5886
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,000
thing.

5887
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:02,000
So yeah,

5888
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I mean,

5889
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:05,000
like we might have a class called the dead eye and it might have the

5890
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:05,000
same themes,

5891
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
but it'll be like different actual mechanics and different things.

5892
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Yeah.

5893
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:09,000
I mean,

5894
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:10,000
yeah,

5895
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,000
even the dead eye,

5896
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
you got tailwind works differently.

5897
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
You've still got an additional projectile,

5898
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,000
you know,

5899
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:16,000
like there,

5900
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
there are things that certainly carry over.

5901
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Um,

5902
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,000
but it's,

5903
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
it's really easy.

5904
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
And it's honestly been fun just looking at them going like,

5905
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,000
you know,

5906
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
now we have all these system changes,

5907
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
all these skills and everything works like this.

5908
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Just what would the perfect class be?

5909
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Not like,

5910
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
how can we retrofit and bandaid appear we won class to work?

5911
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
It's just way better to look at it and go,

5912
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:35,000
here's,

5913
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
here's all the things we want.

5914
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Yeah.

5915
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:37,000
So,

5916
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:38,000
well,

5917
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:38,000
yeah,

5918
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,000
like when you only have now the life and mana flask and stuff,

5919
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:41,000
it could,

5920
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:44,000
obviously things don't work quite the same,

5921
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
but then now you have the charm system and all of a sudden,

5922
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I actually do wonder if path of one would be cool with that.

5923
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Exactly.

5924
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Like stacking charms.

5925
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:50,000
So,

5926
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
so it's,

5927
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
it's just,

5928
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
here are,

5929
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
you know,

5930
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:54,000
12,

5931
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
eventually 36 classes.

5932
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Um,

5933
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
it's not really like,

5934
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
here's the Peewee one counterpart and they're identical kind of thing

5935
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
anymore,

5936
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:02,000
for sure.

5937
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Too many things changed for that to even be possible anyway.

5938
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Yeah.

5939
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
All right.

5940
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:08,000
That sounds very epic.

5941
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Um,

5942
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
we can skip over the flask and trinkets as we did cover that,

5943
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:12,000
uh,

5944
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
very well.

5945
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:13,000
So,

5946
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:13,000
uh,

5947
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,000
moving into,

5948
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
um,

5949
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
skills,

5950
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
I realized I was like,

5951
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
had many pages of questions here.

5952
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:19,000
And then I was like,

5953
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:20,000
wait,

5954
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
we haven't even talked about like skills here.

5955
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,000
It's so much to,

5956
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
so much to,

5957
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
for us to discover over the course of this beta.

5958
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Um,

5959
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
how has the list of skills been shaping up overall?

5960
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:29,000
I mean,

5961
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
it's certainly getting there.

5962
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I mean,

5963
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:31,000
look,

5964
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:31,000
there,

5965
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
there are even certain skills that won't even make it,

5966
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:35,000
even just within the classes we have,

5967
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:36,000
like there are still going to be more,

5968
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:36,000
some more skills coming,

5969
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:37,000
uh,

5970
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
later on as well for the,

5971
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,000
for these classes,

5972
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,000
because,

5973
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,000
um,

5974
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:39,000
there,

5975
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
there are more skills that we got,

5976
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:41,000
um,

5977
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
just about there and,

5978
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:42,000
um,

5979
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:42,000
yeah,

5980
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,000
but just didn't quite,

5981
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,000
didn't quite make it.

5982
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Um,

5983
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:45,000
so,

5984
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:45,000
uh,

5985
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:45,000
yeah.

5986
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,000
And like getting a class finished in terms of the skills you need,

5987
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:48,000
like,

5988
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:49,000
um,

5989
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,000
it,

5990
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:51,000
it sort of seems very easy when you,

5991
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,000
um,

5992
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:52,000
okay,

5993
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
we need like,

5994
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:53,000
you know,

5995
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
22,

5996
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
when you actually come up with all of the things,

5997
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:01,000
you know,

5998
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:01,000
the,

5999
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:02,000
the way they interact together,

6000
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:03,000
um,

6001
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:03,000
you know,

6002
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
the number of prototypes you have to do that kind of don't really work and,

6003
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:06,000
you know,

6004
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
like you end up not being fun.

6005
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Um,

6006
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,000
and then of course the support gem stuff,

6007
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:16,000
like you need to make sure that every skill has enough viable supports so that you can actually even recommend to people to do.

6008
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Yeah.

6009
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Uh,

6010
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,000
then you need things like the,

6011
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:18,000
uh,

6012
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:18,000
you know,

6013
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
the passive tree support for all of them.

6014
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,000
You need to have,

6015
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:21,000
um,

6016
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
all of the,

6017
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
uh,

6018
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:23,000
the,

6019
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,000
the stuff with like buff,

6020
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:24,000
uh,

6021
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
the buff gems for each character class as well.

6022
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Um,

6023
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:27,000
you know,

6024
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
you need to be thinking about uniques for the,

6025
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:29,000
for the type of,

6026
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
uh,

6027
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:30,000
you know,

6028
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:30,000
for the,

6029
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:30,000
uh,

6030
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
that can work with these things.

6031
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:32,000
It's just like,

6032
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,000
there's so many different elements to actually make skills work.

6033
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:35,000
And,

6034
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
uh,

6035
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:36,000
once again,

6036
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
it's another area I think that,

6037
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:37,000
um,

6038
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
was underestimated to some degree,

6039
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:39,000
um,

6040
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:40,000
uh,

6041
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:40,000
before,

6042
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,000
uh,

6043
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:41,000
and,

6044
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:41,000
you know,

6045
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
like it does take a,

6046
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,000
um,

6047
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:44,000
you know,

6048
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,000
to actually get that finished,

6049
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:45,000
it takes a lot.

6050
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Um,

6051
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,000
so,

6052
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:47,000
uh,

6053
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:47,000
yeah,

6054
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:47,000
that's been,

6055
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
um,

6056
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:48,000
a total struggle.

6057
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,000
And we,

6058
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
we didn't think we would have to have only six character classes initially,

6059
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:52,000
uh,

6060
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,000
at the start of early access,

6061
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:54,000
we were thinking we would have eight,

6062
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
um,

6063
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:55,000
uh,

6064
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:56,000
to begin with,

6065
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:56,000
but,

6066
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,000
uh,

6067
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:57,000
yeah,

6068
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,000
when it actually came down to actually getting to actually finish something,

6069
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:00,000
uh,

6070
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:01,000
you know,

6071
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:02,000
like it just ended up being too much.

6072
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Um,

6073
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,000
so,

6074
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:03,000
uh,

6075
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:03,000
you know,

6076
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
now obviously we've got a bunch,

6077
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:05,000
I mean,

6078
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
we've got a bunch of work on more of the classes that we've done,

6079
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:07,000
you know,

6080
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:08,000
there's things there,

6081
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,000
but,

6082
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:09,000
um,

6083
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,000
it's that finishing work of like making sure that all the systems in the game come

6084
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,000
together to support,

6085
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,000
um,

6086
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:14,000
you know,

6087
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:14,000
the,

6088
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:15,000
how that,

6089
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:15,000
how that works.

6090
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Um,

6091
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,000
that requires a lot.

6092
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Doing all of that as we're still discovering how we want those systems to work,

6093
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:21,000
you know,

6094
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
like the changes to support gems and all that,

6095
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
as we're also making support gems,

6096
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,000
as we're making character classes,

6097
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:29,000
just can cause things to slow down quite a bit.

6098
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
And then we have to recalibrate and all.

6099
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Yeah.

6100
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Like it is,

6101
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,000
it was an extreme amount of work that we certainly,

6102
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:36,000
uh,

6103
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
predicted poorly.

6104
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Um,

6105
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
but that was also because we are making all these cool systems,

6106
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,000
all these changes,

6107
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:43,000
uh,

6108
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:44,000
changes to all these systems,

6109
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
which are having like immense benefits as well.

6110
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,000
So,

6111
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,000
yeah,

6112
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I would say it's pretty safe to expect that,

6113
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:50,000
you know,

6114
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
as much as you can't play them on day zero,

6115
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:53,000
um,

6116
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,000
a lot of some of those other classes that we have shown in the past,

6117
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,000
um,

6118
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,000
and some of the skills and stuff,

6119
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
there's a lot there,

6120
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,000
like just not to make it seem like it's shallow or anything,

6121
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
but we will be adding those classes in for sure.

6122
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Yeah.

6123
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:09,000
The thing that keeps like surprising me is,

6124
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:09,000
um,

6125
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:10,000
well,

6126
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,000
when you click that old gems tab,

6127
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,000
when you're doing an uncut,

6128
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
there's quite a lot of skills in there,

6129
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
but you initially kind of box yourself away,

6130
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:17,000
where you think,

6131
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:17,000
okay,

6132
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,000
so I'm playing the mercenary.

6133
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:20,000
So I'm just looking at the crossbow skills.

6134
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,000
And then I was like,

6135
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:21,000
well,

6136
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:24,000
what if I go look at the elemental skills and then I find a flame wall and I'm like,

6137
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Oh,

6138
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,000
I can shoot my projectiles through that.

6139
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Okay,

6140
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
cool.

6141
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:26,000
I like that,

6142
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:32,000
but that's like surface level because you also have the weapon swap thing and you can actually viably do with the automated weapon swapping.

6143
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:36,000
It's not like toxic where you have to push the button a bunch of times.

6144
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:40,000
And you've got the trees that like customize whenever you do it automatically on the fly.

6145
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,000
So that's like,

6146
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,000
all of a sudden I'm like,

6147
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Oh,

6148
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:42,000
well,

6149
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,000
why can't I use a sword on the other hand?

6150
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Yes.

6151
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,000
You absolutely can do other stuff.

6152
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
That's actually a very cool mercenary vibe sword and crossbow.

6153
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:50,000
So,

6154
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:50,000
um,

6155
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:50,000
yeah,

6156
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:51,000
I mean,

6157
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:51,000
that stuff is like,

6158
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:52,000
is,

6159
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:52,000
is crazy.

6160
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I mean,

6161
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:53,000
like in the,

6162
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:53,000
in the,

6163
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:55,000
actually there was one in the,

6164
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,000
the,

6165
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:56,000
the,

6166
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:56,000
uh,

6167
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:57,000
community guys recorded where they were using,

6168
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,000
um,

6169
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:58,000
a bell,

6170
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
the,

6171
02:32:59,000 --> 02:32:59,000
the,

6172
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
the bell skill with the quarterstaff with the,

6173
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:02,000
um,

6174
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:02,000
uh,

6175
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
the rapid,

6176
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,000
the rapid shot,

6177
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:04,000
uh,

6178
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
mercenary skill.

6179
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,000
And when I saw it,

6180
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:06,000
oh man,

6181
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
you know,

6182
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:07,000
it's like,

6183
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
it's like a whole other thing.

6184
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Um,

6185
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:09,000
yeah,

6186
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:09,000
like that,

6187
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
I didn't even know about that,

6188
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,000
about that particular combo,

6189
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:12,000
uh,

6190
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,000
until I saw it in the,

6191
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:13,000
uh,

6192
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:14,000
some of the footage they recorded.

6193
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I started,

6194
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:15,000
uh,

6195
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:15,000
yeah,

6196
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
I started thinking about that too with like multiplayer.

6197
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:17,000
I was like,

6198
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
so I was throwing my gas grenades,

6199
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
which you can blow up with your explosive grenades.

6200
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:25,000
But then I was throwing it at a boss that was doing burning ground and they were blowing up instantly.

6201
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:25,000
I'm like,

6202
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:25,000
oh wait,

6203
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,000
so it reacts to the environment.

6204
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Well,

6205
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,000
it's obviously going to react to my friends doing burning ground then.

6206
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Oh yes.

6207
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Oh yes.

6208
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,000
It's my flame wall friend.

6209
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:31,000
And this,

6210
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
and this is the reason,

6211
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:37,000
like this conversation here is the reason why there's going to be crazy builds that we don't anticipate.

6212
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Because like,

6213
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:38,000
like,

6214
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:38,000
like,

6215
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:38,000
like,

6216
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,000
like the,

6217
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:39,000
the,

6218
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:39,000
the,

6219
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
some of the stuff that can happen between classes,

6220
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I just have no doubt we will not have discovered.

6221
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Yeah.

6222
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Like how much co-op have you really been able to test?

6223
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:46,000
I mean,

6224
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:46,000
we,

6225
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,000
I mean,

6226
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:47,000
like we,

6227
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
we do test party play all the time.

6228
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Like it marks,

6229
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
marks,

6230
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:50,000
marks like,

6231
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I'm the support character player.

6232
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Now I'm like freezing armor,

6233
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:55,000
breaking,

6234
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
putting down clouds slowly,

6235
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:57,000
you know,

6236
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:57,000
I'm like,

6237
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,000
holy,

6238
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
there's just a lot going on all of a sudden.

6239
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I'm not just standing there.

6240
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Like I got buffs coming out of me.

6241
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
You know,

6242
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:03,000
it's like,

6243
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,000
you know,

6244
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,000
you're like,

6245
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:09,000
I'm actually doing all this active support and like different conditions to synergize with the group.

6246
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:10,000
And how can it's like,

6247
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,000
okay,

6248
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
you're doing that skill.

6249
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Okay.

6250
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:16,000
What I'm going to do is I'm going to just do this and enhance my armor breaking and go ballistic armor breaking.

6251
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
And you just spam your thing that consumes it,

6252
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:19,000
you know?

6253
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
So you get a lot of that stuff going on for sure.

6254
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Where,

6255
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:21,000
um,

6256
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,000
I,

6257
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:24,000
but you know,

6258
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:24,000
it,

6259
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,000
it's kind of honestly the terrifying part as well,

6260
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,000
where it's like,

6261
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
you know,

6262
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:30,000
what do we have?

6263
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:33,000
We had the whole like vulnerability curse with,

6264
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
with gas cloud ticks or something.

6265
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:36,000
And it was like literally applying armor break,

6266
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:38,000
like every frame.

6267
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
And so you have the monsters going,

6268
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:39,000
tink,

6269
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:39,000
tink,

6270
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:39,000
tink,

6271
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,000
tink,

6272
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,000
tink,

6273
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,000
tink,

6274
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,000
tink,

6275
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,000
tink,

6276
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,000
tink,

6277
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:40,000
tink,

6278
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:41,000
tink,

6279
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:41,000
yeah.

6280
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:44,000
And then you have some other thing and you have some other guy consuming it.

6281
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:44,000
And again,

6282
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Oh my God,

6283
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:48,000
quill rain just don't even how many bloody synergistic things with quill rain.

6284
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,000
You can do a lot with that.

6285
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
All the lightning arrows on the ground.

6286
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,000
And cause they can,

6287
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:52,000
you know,

6288
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
lightning things hit them and explode.

6289
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
And all of a sudden now you're just,

6290
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
everyone's running around with quill rain,

6291
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:57,000
spamming lightning rods everywhere.

6292
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,000
And yeah.

6293
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
And frost wall somehow frost wall,

6294
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,000
we had about 15 abuse cases.

6295
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:03,000
And I mean,

6296
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
that's historically accurate.

6297
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Yeah.

6298
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Kinetic blast frost walls and all that.

6299
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
It returns.

6300
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Sounds like it's coming back.

6301
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:12,000
It's,

6302
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:12,000
it'll be fun.

6303
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:13,000
It's cool.

6304
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Even finding all the stuff so far has been really fun.

6305
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:16,000
But yeah,

6306
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I generally play multiplayer.

6307
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Most of the alpha I've done is being in multiplayer,

6308
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
play with other people.

6309
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
It's good to get a lot of that testing in there as well.

6310
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Cause not a lot of others do it.

6311
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
That's really good.

6312
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:28,000
And then yeah,

6313
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,000
try and see what we can break just for good fun.

6314
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Honestly,

6315
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
the thing that's like hard is to then like,

6316
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
cause you get this thing,

6317
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:40,000
which is quite interesting where you have a staff is both the player and a

6318
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:40,000
developer.

6319
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
And I'm off the like,

6320
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:42,000
don't you,

6321
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
you better not keep that X that,

6322
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:45,000
you know,

6323
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,000
something that's,

6324
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:47,000
I wouldn't say exploit,

6325
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:47,000
but you know,

6326
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,000
something that's OP,

6327
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
a secret,

6328
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:49,000
right?

6329
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:52,000
You better tell me because the exact reaction you had earlier.

6330
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
You were saying people weren't telling you about their build.

6331
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Exactly.

6332
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Like you get a situation,

6333
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
someone doesn't want to tell you about their build.

6334
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:57,000
That's cause they're like,

6335
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Oh,

6336
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Mark will nerf it then.

6337
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
You're supposed to be making games.

6338
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Exactly.

6339
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,000
I legitimately had a Monday meeting and you know,

6340
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,000
whatever.

6341
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:07,000
I was like,

6342
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:11,000
I swear if I see any of you at the top of the ladder on day one,

6343
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:12,000
we're going to have a talk.

6344
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,000
Exactly.

6345
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
I know you've hidden something from me.

6346
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Exactly.

6347
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:16,000
No,

6348
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
I did tell you about my flash bangs and I good,

6349
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,000
but maybe it's fine.

6350
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:19,000
I just don't,

6351
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I just wanted them to check.

6352
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
That is the thing that is hard.

6353
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,000
No one knows if their thing is actually,

6354
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:24,000
look,

6355
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:25,000
there's a line that gets crossed.

6356
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Yes.

6357
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Yeah.

6358
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:27,000
But sometimes you don't know,

6359
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:27,000
is it just,

6360
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:31,000
I found something cool and it's powerful or have I found something cool and it's broken,

6361
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:32,000
you know,

6362
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:32,000
and,

6363
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
and those things,

6364
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:34,000
I mean,

6365
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
we have to make those decisions of course.

6366
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:36,000
And a lot of the time,

6367
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
what is reported is just fine.

6368
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:38,000
And it's like,

6369
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:39,000
yeah,

6370
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:39,000
you've,

6371
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
you've got a good weapon and you've got the right,

6372
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:42,000
you've got this combat.

6373
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:42,000
You,

6374
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:42,000
you're strong.

6375
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:43,000
If it's,

6376
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:44,000
if it's supported by items,

6377
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,000
then it's like fine to be very powerful.

6378
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:46,000
But if you're just like,

6379
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
I just pick these skills and no matter what weapons I'm wearing,

6380
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
I'm just like completely ridiculous.

6381
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Then that's a different situation.

6382
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:55,000
Cause now it's just a thing that anyone can do at a moment's notice rather than actually requiring like,

6383
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:55,000
you know,

6384
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:55,000
Oh,

6385
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I have to find the big,

6386
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:56,000
you know,

6387
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
this combo of items and things like that.

6388
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:58,000
That,

6389
02:36:58,000 --> 02:36:59,000
so that's a much different story.

6390
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Um,

6391
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:01,000
yeah.

6392
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:02,000
We've had a lot of good testing,

6393
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,000
a lot of good feedback,

6394
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:04,000
a lot of good,

6395
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,000
um,

6396
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:06,000
people reporting that stuff,

6397
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:07,000
especially in the last month,

6398
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,000
it's like coming in a lot.

6399
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Cause as the systems and everything's kind of stabilizing,

6400
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
you start to get a lot more of that.

6401
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
And people are understanding what the,

6402
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:16,000
uh,

6403
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:19,000
difficulties meant to be and what the power of characters is meant to be.

6404
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
As all of that came and started to stabilize,

6405
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
we got a lot more of this coming in and we are kind of getting more understanding,

6406
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:25,000
but again,

6407
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
you'll never find them all,

6408
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:27,000
but,

6409
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:27,000
uh,

6410
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:28,000
you know,

6411
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:29,000
it's fun,

6412
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:29,000
good,

6413
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,000
fun journey.

6414
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Support gems have changed a lot.

6415
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:35,000
How have you found the changes to them being now having no levels and,

6416
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:36,000
uh,

6417
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:39,000
the restriction of having only one support gem on your character of a type,

6418
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:40,000
but having a lot more of them.

6419
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,000
I really like how this works.

6420
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Like I think that it adds so much more build diversity and interest,

6421
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:45,000
um,

6422
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
to have to be making the decision of like,

6423
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:47,000
you know,

6424
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,000
where is this going to go?

6425
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
And the thing that's been important though,

6426
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:51,000
with that system is it's required.

6427
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,000
It requires a lot more support gems to exist because you need,

6428
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,000
because you don't have one on your character.

6429
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:55,000
You need,

6430
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:56,000
you need tons of them.

6431
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:57,000
And like,

6432
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:57,000
you need like,

6433
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
you need a lot of different ways to increase damage and a lot of ways to

6434
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,000
support different mechanics.

6435
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:01,000
It's like,

6436
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
if you're going to have something like freeze,

6437
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:03,000
like,

6438
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:03,000
you know,

6439
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:04,000
if you're going to have a freezing skill,

6440
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:07,000
you need to be able to support that and augment that in like many different ways.

6441
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:11,000
And there needs to be more options than what you can even like.

6442
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
there needs to be in order to have choice.

6443
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,000
You can't just have five.

6444
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,000
Here's your five freeze things.

6445
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:16,000
And that's all you do,

6446
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:16,000
right?

6447
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
There has to be more than that in order to be able to have it.

6448
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:19,000
So you actually have some choices as well.

6449
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
So,

6450
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:20,000
uh,

6451
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:23,000
that kind of stuff has meant that you just need a lot of things going on there.

6452
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:24,000
But I think that,

6453
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,000
um,

6454
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
the choices that you end up with as a player of like,

6455
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:27,000
you know,

6456
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:28,000
where do I put my model projectiles?

6457
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Where do I put my PS?

6458
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Where do I put like,

6459
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
I think that leads to a lot more interesting decisions,

6460
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:32,000
um,

6461
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,000
with how you build.

6462
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,000
And,

6463
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:34,000
um,

6464
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:35,000
uh,

6465
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:35,000
you know,

6466
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:36,000
like,

6467
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:36,000
uh,

6468
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:36,000
yeah,

6469
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
I think that,

6470
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:38,000
that to me is where a lot of the,

6471
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:40,000
why it just works so much better.

6472
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:42,000
And we were certainly hesitant about the whole,

6473
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:43,000
um,

6474
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:43,000
you know,

6475
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:47,000
you can only have one support per character thing because it sounds bad.

6476
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
If you just hear about it as a player without actually playing it,

6477
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
like your first reaction is you just hear that and you're like,

6478
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:50,000
oh,

6479
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,000
it's just a restriction.

6480
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
And it is arbitrary in some sense,

6481
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:53,000
right?

6482
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:54,000
There's no,

6483
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,000
like we can't justify it thematically really.

6484
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Um,

6485
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,000
it's just a,

6486
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:58,000
it's just,

6487
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,000
it just is what it is.

6488
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
And so that,

6489
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
I really don't like that kind of thing usually because,

6490
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:02,000
um,

6491
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
if I'm going to,

6492
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:06,000
I want the theme to match the mechanic as much as possible,

6493
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,000
but in this case it just made the gameplay so much better that,

6494
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:09,000
um,

6495
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:10,000
like it just had to happen.

6496
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Um,

6497
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,000
so arguably if you,

6498
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,000
if you need to like,

6499
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
if you end up in a situation where you like,

6500
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I have to put the support on every slot.

6501
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Exactly.

6502
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,000
That,

6503
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:18,000
that is less choice.

6504
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
And that's the reason why the gameplay is less choice,

6505
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,000
less interest.

6506
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,000
And also you may as well just bake that now into the skills and or

6507
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,000
100%.

6508
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
And so this is the thing.

6509
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
It is actually much worse to have that because it,

6510
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
it results in this outcome,

6511
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
but like,

6512
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
that's a kind of more subtle argument that's like,

6513
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:35,000
you have to kind of make to people if you want to kind of convince them

6514
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,000
that this is actually the right way.

6515
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Um,

6516
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
because when you tell people,

6517
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Oh,

6518
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
there's this restriction,

6519
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
it doesn't sound like what they're getting out of that is more choice.

6520
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,000
It sounds like they're getting less.

6521
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Um,

6522
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
but the reality is it is actually more choice because you no longer have

6523
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,000
like mandatory,

6524
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,000
uh,

6525
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:46,000
like here's the,

6526
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
here's the five mandatory things you have to put on the skill.

6527
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Um,

6528
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:49,000
it's like,

6529
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
it's actually much more going on.

6530
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:54,000
I think it's much better helped realize my experience on the mercenary

6531
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:54,000
that you,

6532
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:55,000
uh,

6533
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:56,000
your vision of,

6534
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:56,000
uh,

6535
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:01,000
having like all of these skills available to you and them actually being worth

6536
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:01,000
using.

6537
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:02,000
For sure.

6538
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Because if you had all the same support gems,

6539
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
I feel like you just pick the one that does the most damage.

6540
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,000
And you make it do the most damage.

6541
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:08,000
And that's the only skill you use.

6542
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:08,000
And I mean,

6543
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,000
the great thing is,

6544
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
is now it's completely reasonable to have a skill in your character that you

6545
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,000
just use occasionally,

6546
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:12,000
right?

6547
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Like every five minutes you might have a situation where you need to use

6548
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:15,000
that.

6549
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
And that's actually fine and completely reasonable.

6550
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Yeah.

6551
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:18,000
So I'm playing a grenade or,

6552
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:19,000
and I would be like,

6553
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:19,000
okay,

6554
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:23,000
I should only use this grenade normally is what I would be like in part of

6555
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:23,000
exile.

6556
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Cause this is the best grenade or maybe this one that does like interacts

6557
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:27,000
with it in some way,

6558
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:28,000
the obvious combo.

6559
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
But now I'm actually like,

6560
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:30,000
well,

6561
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:34,000
there's a reason I could use those lightning ones to apply a shock because I

6562
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
have all these shock support gems that I'm not using anywhere else.

6563
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Cause I'm using the damage and the LMP on my big damage dealers.

6564
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:41,000
I can use,

6565
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
I can put the shock things on there and I can actually have a shock set up.

6566
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I can incorporate that into my build.

6567
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:48,000
I can incorporate poison into my build to strip their armor and whatnot.

6568
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:50,000
And that actually is something I can support.

6569
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
And maybe you only use that occasionally when you face something that's got heavy

6570
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:52,000
armor,

6571
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:52,000
you know?

6572
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Yeah.

6573
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Yeah.

6574
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:54,000
But it's like,

6575
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:54,000
it's like that,

6576
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
that kind of stuff I really want to be viable.

6577
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
And that situational stuff I think just makes the game way more interesting.

6578
02:40:59,000 --> 02:40:59,000
It's,

6579
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:02,000
it's really feeding into the flavor of the mercenaries like this,

6580
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:05,000
like prepared kind of fighter who has all these tools at their disposal as

6581
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:05,000
well.

6582
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Like,

6583
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:06,000
you're like,

6584
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:07,000
I have this grenade for,

6585
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:08,000
if I get into this situation,

6586
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:09,000
this grenade for this one.

6587
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,000
It's like,

6588
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:10,000
good.

6589
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:11,000
I love it.

6590
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
A couple of questions here.

6591
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:17,000
People definitely been asking about like vile skills and transfigured gems and

6592
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:17,000
stuff like that.

6593
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
I feel like this sort of thing doesn't make sense at launch.

6594
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Yeah.

6595
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Because ultimately if we were going to add something like that,

6596
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
it would make sense to add it just as another skill.

6597
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:25,000
So at this point,

6598
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:26,000
there's no real reason to do that.

6599
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Like that kind of stuff comes in where we want to have a specific reward system

6600
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:30,000
somewhere that wants to be able to do that.

6601
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
And so we don't really need to do it right now,

6602
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:33,000
but you look,

6603
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
we might decide to bring that theme back and,

6604
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:35,000
you know,

6605
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,000
in a reward system.

6606
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Yeah.

6607
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:37,000
I think for vile skills,

6608
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:38,000
especially it's a,

6609
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,000
it's a cool flavor.

6610
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Yeah,

6611
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
for sure.

6612
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
But I think the transfigured thing is also interesting.

6613
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Like,

6614
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:42,000
you know,

6615
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,000
if you're looking to be able to like,

6616
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
the reason why transfigured was nice is because it's like,

6617
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,000
we got to sort of iterate on a bunch of different themes around the same

6618
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:49,000
skill,

6619
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:53,000
which obviously at this point we don't need to do that because we've got,

6620
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
we're already still adding the skills,

6621
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:55,000
you know what I mean?

6622
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:59,000
So all the iterations of it are like less of a necessary thing.

6623
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,000
But yeah,

6624
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:00,000
I mean,

6625
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:01,000
I'm just like,

6626
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:02,000
I'm sure we'll be doing more stuff like that in the future.

6627
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:03,000
Like we absolutely will be.

6628
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Do you know how many skills roughly you have,

6629
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Sasha going to end up with?

6630
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:08,000
You know,

6631
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
I actually don't know the number off the top of my head,

6632
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,000
but what I will say is,

6633
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:12,000
is that we initially,

6634
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
I think when we announced like what the full game would have,

6635
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:15,000
we said 240.

6636
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I'm pretty sure we're actually nearing that.

6637
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
I feel definitely,

6638
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:20,000
it's going to be way higher than that.

6639
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Yeah.

6640
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Yeah.

6641
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Cause I think we're nearing that now when we've only added half the

6642
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:22,000
classes.

6643
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:26,000
So I think that that means that there's going to be a lot more than that.

6644
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:27,000
I know a hundred of them or whatever,

6645
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
like some little utility skill or whatever,

6646
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:29,000
but there's,

6647
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,000
even if you discount for those,

6648
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:34,000
it's still many major skills.

6649
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Yeah.

6650
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:34,000
You got what?

6651
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Like,

6652
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:35,000
cause there's 20 to,

6653
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
there's 20 to 25 for each of those,

6654
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,000
for each class.

6655
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:39,000
And so just with six of those,

6656
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
I'm terrible at math in my head,

6657
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
but I feel like that's 120.

6658
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Well,

6659
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:44,000
let's,

6660
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:49,000
let's say it's just a bit over 110 or something.

6661
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:50,000
End up around there,

6662
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,000
120,

6663
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,000
something like that around.

6664
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Yeah,

6665
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I think probably 120 around there like that.

6666
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:57,000
But then you've also got all the buff gems as well.

6667
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
And like each character class has nine of those.

6668
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,000
So that then sort of adds up.

6669
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:04,000
So you've already reached probably 200 just by the time you've got to there.

6670
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Um,

6671
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:05,000
and then,

6672
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:06,000
uh,

6673
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
and then it doesn't even count things that really are skills,

6674
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:09,000
but like are not,

6675
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:11,000
you don't get them via a skill gem.

6676
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Um,

6677
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:16,000
so like we're talking about all the ascendancy little skills and there's like uniques that have little skill things on them.

6678
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Well,

6679
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,000
all,

6680
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,000
all staffs,

6681
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
wands and scepters have a skill back in.

6682
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Exactly.

6683
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:21,000
We're not even counting that,

6684
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:21,000
right?

6685
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Like,

6686
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:22,000
cause the staffs,

6687
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
wands and scepters have skills built in.

6688
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Yeah.

6689
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Uh,

6690
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:24,000
and then those are like,

6691
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:25,000
that's another,

6692
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:25,000
how many of those?

6693
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
There's like 20 of those probably.

6694
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Yeah.

6695
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:28,000
I mean.

6696
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Like if you add them all up.

6697
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I don't know who remembers all these things.

6698
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:34,000
No one has counted recently,

6699
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:34,000
uh,

6700
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:35,000
but,

6701
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:35,000
uh,

6702
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:36,000
there's a bunch.

6703
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Countless,

6704
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,000
countless skills.

6705
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Um,

6706
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
ascendancy classes with skills.

6707
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Yeah.

6708
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Yeah.

6709
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Yeah.

6710
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:42,000
That's tons.

6711
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Yeah.

6712
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,000
That's tons.

6713
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Yeah.

6714
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:44,000
And those skills,

6715
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:45,000
those skills,

6716
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:45,000
by the way,

6717
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,000
ascendancy class skills are fully supportable.

6718
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Yeah.

6719
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Yeah.

6720
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:49,000
That's wild.

6721
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Cause I remember you did the thing with the fault attack where you can support that.

6722
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,000
you can support the fault attack.

6723
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Um,

6724
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
and you can support any skill that comes from something.

6725
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,000
That one caught me by surprise.

6726
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
I was like,

6727
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Oh wow,

6728
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,000
you can actually link those up.

6729
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Yep.

6730
02:43:59,000 --> 02:43:59,000
It's a,

6731
02:43:59,000 --> 02:43:59,000
yeah.

6732
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,000
So you're,

6733
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
you're going to end up with quite a lot going on there.

6734
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,000
I was even surprised when I was like,

6735
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Oh,

6736
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,000
I can add,

6737
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:04,000
you know,

6738
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:06,000
additional accuracy to herald of ice.

6739
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
And it like provides a buff to my character.

6740
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
I can like add buffs through support.

6741
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Well,

6742
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,000
you know why that is though?

6743
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Because,

6744
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:12,000
uh,

6745
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:12,000
those,

6746
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:16,000
those things like heralds are so hard to find like a good set of supports to

6747
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,000
recommend.

6748
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:17,000
So we're like,

6749
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,000
damn it,

6750
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,000
we have to come up with like tons of these now.

6751
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,000
They're like really difficult.

6752
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
You can like create a custom aura.

6753
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:22,000
absolutely.

6754
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Absolutely.

6755
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:23,000
So yeah,

6756
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:24,000
it's,

6757
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:24,000
um,

6758
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
that,

6759
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:25,000
that actually means it's,

6760
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:26,000
it's actually nice because,

6761
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:27,000
um,

6762
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:27,000
part of the,

6763
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,000
um,

6764
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:31,000
it means that you get the feeling of having more aura effects on your

6765
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
character without having to have the spam of actual auras that,

6766
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:33,000
um,

6767
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:34,000
every,

6768
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
many characters had in here we won,

6769
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:37,000
but you get to kind of have all that stuff as well.

6770
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Um,

6771
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:38,000
so,

6772
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
uh,

6773
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:39,000
that's,

6774
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:39,000
that's been really nice.

6775
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Thanks for the,

6776
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:41,000
uh,

6777
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,000
invisible or MTX.

6778
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Well,

6779
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
it does remind me though.

6780
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Um,

6781
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,000
so with all the,

6782
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
this is very off topic,

6783
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
but with all the,

6784
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:48,000
uh,

6785
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:52,000
very good teasers you've been doing for like new 3d art for uniques and

6786
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:53,000
stuff like that,

6787
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,000
have you had any thoughts about,

6788
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,000
uh,

6789
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:55,000
reworking,

6790
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:55,000
um,

6791
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,000
the transfer skin transfer?

6792
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Yeah.

6793
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Um,

6794
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
honestly,

6795
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
it's not an hour thing about stuff we're thinking about,

6796
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,000
you know,

6797
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:05,000
like it'll work the same way it works for now at least.

6798
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Um,

6799
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:06,000
but obviously,

6800
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,000
uh,

6801
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,000
skin transfer and PeeWee too.

6802
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
There's a lot more cool base art.

6803
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Yeah.

6804
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
That's going to make people actually want to use it.

6805
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:13,000
So yeah,

6806
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:16,000
it'd be cool to see something for that in the future potentially.

6807
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Um,

6808
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
so onto the end game,

6809
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:19,000
which was,

6810
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
I feel like a big bulk of the announcement for sure.

6811
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Yeah.

6812
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Um,

6813
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:26,000
so just as like an overview.

6814
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:30,000
So we have the end game versions just for beta launch,

6815
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:30,000
by the way,

6816
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
because it's going to be a lot more later.

6817
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Yeah.

6818
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:33,000
We don't have the,

6819
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
we have the end game pinnacle versions of the two,

6820
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:36,000
um,

6821
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,000
trials.

6822
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Yep.

6823
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:40,000
So as like fully farmable content,

6824
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,000
they don't have trees though.

6825
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Those ones.

6826
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:42,000
They don't have trees,

6827
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
but they do have a progression system of some kind.

6828
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,000
So you've got the relics in,

6829
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:45,000
um,

6830
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:45,000
in,

6831
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:46,000
in,

6832
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:46,000
in the sanctum,

6833
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:47,000
uh,

6834
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:47,000
sequel.

6835
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:48,000
And then,

6836
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:48,000
um,

6837
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:49,000
for the trial of chaos,

6838
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:49,000
you have,

6839
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:49,000
um,

6840
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:50,000
the,

6841
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,000
uh,

6842
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
the inscribed,

6843
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:53,000
uh,

6844
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
ultimatums have getting mods,

6845
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:56,000
uh,

6846
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:56,000
uh,

6847
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:56,000
from,

6848
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:57,000
from the end.

6849
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:58,000
So when you kill the,

6850
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:58,000
um,

6851
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
final,

6852
02:45:59,000 --> 02:45:59,000
um,

6853
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,000
uh,

6854
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:00,000
the,

6855
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:01,000
the,

6856
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:02,000
the final boss of that,

6857
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:02,000
uh,

6858
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:03,000
which is,

6859
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:03,000
you know,

6860
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:04,000
alleged to be the trial master.

6861
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Um,

6862
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:05,000
then,

6863
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:05,000
uh,

6864
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:06,000
you,

6865
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:06,000
um,

6866
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:06,000
alleged.

6867
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Yeah.

6868
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Then,

6869
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:08,000
uh,

6870
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:08,000
you know,

6871
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:09,000
he'll drop,

6872
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:09,000
uh,

6873
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:10,000
uh,

6874
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:11,000
items that can,

6875
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:11,000
um,

6876
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
then have mods on them to make the trial itself harder.

6877
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:16,000
And there's also some pretty interesting ones on there that we actually were going to put in the video,

6878
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,000
but it was starting to get a bit long,

6879
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:17,000
um,

6880
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:18,000
which was that,

6881
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:18,000
um,

6882
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:19,000
you've got the thing which I,

6883
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:20,000
uh,

6884
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,000
where you've got the,

6885
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:21,000
uh,

6886
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:21,000
the,

6887
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
the bets that you can make of like,

6888
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:23,000
you know,

6889
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
uh,

6890
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,000
put up,

6891
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:25,000
uh,

6892
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:25,000
you know,

6893
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
13 exalts and then,

6894
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:27,000
uh,

6895
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
you might get double that back if you're able to complete the thing.

6896
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
So those are some of the mods that can spawn on there.

6897
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Um,

6898
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:32,000
and,

6899
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:32,000
uh,

6900
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
as well as mods that make the actual trial harder as well.

6901
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:34,000
So,

6902
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:34,000
um,

6903
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:35,000
there's things like that as well.

6904
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:35,000
So yeah,

6905
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:38,000
those two have those kind of like different outside the outstriks.

6906
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Cause they're not really part of the Atlas.

6907
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
Like you'll get keys for them while you're playing in game,

6908
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,000
but technically speaking,

6909
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:43,000
they're kind of like,

6910
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:44,000
they,

6911
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:44,000
they,

6912
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:44,000
they go,

6913
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,000
they scale to end game,

6914
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
but they're not like sort of part of the,

6915
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:47,000
the whole Atlas,

6916
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:48,000
um,

6917
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:48,000
um,

6918
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
like play them there.

6919
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Yeah.

6920
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:51,000
So their own distinct.

6921
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Exactly.

6922
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Exactly.

6923
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
So there'll be three roguelike dungeon things that will be.

6924
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Sure.

6925
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Sure.

6926
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Sure.

6927
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Um,

6928
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,000
I wouldn't,

6929
02:46:58,000 --> 02:46:59,000
I wouldn't say three roguelike dungeons.

6930
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:02,000
I will say there'll be three trials that have various mechanics that are,

6931
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:03,000
you know,

6932
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:03,000
different.

6933
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Yeah.

6934
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:04,000
But,

6935
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:04,000
uh,

6936
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:05,000
then,

6937
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:06,000
then of course you've got the,

6938
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:06,000
um,

6939
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,000
uh,

6940
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
for kind of what I guess would say sort of,

6941
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:09,000
um,

6942
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:10,000
I don't,

6943
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:11,000
we actually need a name for what,

6944
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:12,000
what are we calling,

6945
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
what are we calling the things that are icons on the,

6946
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:15,000
on the,

6947
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:15,000
on the,

6948
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
cause they were called leagues,

6949
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:17,000
but they're not really.

6950
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Yeah.

6951
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,000
It doesn't really make sense to call it a league.

6952
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:19,000
Exactly.

6953
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:20,000
That is what we call them internally.

6954
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,000
We just call them as like,

6955
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:25,000
there are four leagues that you have that appear there.

6956
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:26,000
It doesn't really work.

6957
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Um,

6958
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,000
uh,

6959
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:28,000
I don't have a good idea right now.

6960
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Yeah.

6961
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:30,000
We probably have actually named it.

6962
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
I just don't remember what it is.

6963
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:33,000
And then you've got,

6964
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:33,000
uh,

6965
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
the kind of boss hunting kind of element as well.

6966
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Uh,

6967
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:36,000
and then the kind of,

6968
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:39,000
I guess what you would say is the pinnacle of the kind of boss hunting thing is then,

6969
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:39,000
you know,

6970
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:42,000
you've got the cities with the lieutenants and then the Uber act bosses.

6971
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,000
And then above that,

6972
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:44,000
you have the pinnacle boss who,

6973
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:45,000
uh,

6974
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:45,000
we don't want to spoil.

6975
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Um,

6976
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:47,000
although I did,

6977
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:47,000
uh,

6978
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,000
show you a little bit about it,

6979
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:49,000
uh,

6980
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:49,000
just in private,

6981
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:50,000
uh,

6982
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:50,000
before.

6983
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Um,

6984
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:51,000
but,

6985
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:51,000
uh,

6986
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,000
yeah,

6987
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:52,000
that's,

6988
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:52,000
uh,

6989
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,000
that one's going to be,

6990
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:53,000
that one's going to be hard.

6991
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Like,

6992
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:54,000
uh,

6993
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:55,000
I know you're,

6994
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:58,000
you're cooking up some pretty difficult mechanics there.

6995
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Um,

6996
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
yeah,

6997
02:47:59,000 --> 02:47:59,000
it's fun.

6998
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,000
I asked the,

6999
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,000
that's the fun stuff.

7000
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Yeah.

7001
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Cause now you don't need to worry about if people can't progress through,

7002
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,000
it's not a progression blocker.

7003
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,000
You can just kill them.

7004
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Yeah.

7005
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Yeah.

7006
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:08,000
It's a progression,

7007
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:10,000
it's a progression blocker to,

7008
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:10,000
uh,

7009
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:10,000
difficulty,

7010
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:11,000
uh,

7011
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:12,000
to the higher difficulties though,

7012
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:12,000
because yeah,

7013
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:12,000
once you,

7014
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:13,000
once you kill that,

7015
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:13,000
of course,

7016
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
then you get the increase of the difficulties and then it's like,

7017
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:15,000
okay,

7018
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:16,000
now try it again,

7019
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,000
but way harder.

7020
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:18,000
And then,

7021
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:18,000
you know,

7022
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:18,000
like,

7023
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,000
and then there's four,

7024
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
there's four levels of difficulty for each of those,

7025
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:21,000
um,

7026
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,000
for each end game system like that.

7027
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:23,000
So yeah,

7028
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
like apart from the trials,

7029
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:25,000
the end game trials,

7030
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:31,000
everything has like its own distinct passive tree and progression through them is also by doing them.

7031
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Yes,

7032
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
exactly.

7033
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Yeah.

7034
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,000
So we really wanted to prevent the situation where you feel like you,

7035
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:35,000
um,

7036
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:41,000
allocate points for a certain piece of content and then you feel like you can't do the other content because you're kind of wasting the points that you've got.

7037
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Yeah,

7038
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:41,000
the lock in.

7039
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,000
And,

7040
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:42,000
uh,

7041
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:42,000
we kind of,

7042
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:43,000
uh,

7043
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:46,000
band-aided that in POE1 by adding multiple Atlas trees as a way,

7044
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:49,000
but I think the solution is much better where effectively you can progress all of them and you can either do like,

7045
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:49,000
you know,

7046
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
just all in a one for a while,

7047
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:51,000
or you can just like,

7048
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:52,000
you know,

7049
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,000
do each of them as you come to them and,

7050
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:53,000
you know,

7051
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,000
just add them kind of piecemeal.

7052
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Um,

7053
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:55,000
um,

7054
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:55,000
but either way,

7055
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
however you want to do it,

7056
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:57,000
um,

7057
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:57,000
you know,

7058
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:58,000
you,

7059
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:58,000
you can make progress,

7060
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
progress on your character.

7061
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Um,

7062
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:00,000
well,

7063
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:01,000
I should say in your league,

7064
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:01,000
uh,

7065
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:02,000
uh,

7066
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:02,000
for all,

7067
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
for all of those.

7068
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Um,

7069
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:03,000
because,

7070
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,000
uh,

7071
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:04,000
the,

7072
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:05,000
the progress and all that stuff is of course,

7073
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:05,000
um,

7074
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,000
you know,

7075
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:06,000
for the whole league,

7076
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:07,000
not just for a single character.

7077
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Yeah.

7078
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:09,000
And previously we use the Atlas tree,

7079
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:15,000
I would say very much so to make sure that we were doing the type of content that we wanted to do.

7080
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Yeah.

7081
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:18,000
So now it's not so much about finding the content because that's what the tablets are for.

7082
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Yeah.

7083
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Now it's more about,

7084
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:20,000
um,

7085
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
improving your ability to,

7086
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:22,000
um,

7087
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:22,000
like,

7088
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:23,000
uh,

7089
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,000
uh,

7090
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,000
sustain effectively.

7091
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Like you,

7092
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:25,000
you,

7093
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:25,000
you're,

7094
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:28,000
you're going to want to have those points to sort of get sustainability for the next level up.

7095
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:31,000
And we want to make sure that there is sustain if you're doing,

7096
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:31,000
you know,

7097
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:32,000
engaging with those mechanics well.

7098
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Yeah.

7099
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Um,

7100
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:34,000
but effectively you do have to actually like to,

7101
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
to get sustain at higher difficulties.

7102
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Um,

7103
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,000
you will need to be able to,

7104
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:38,000
you know,

7105
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:42,000
be making smart choices in terms of allocating and like using the tablets correctly and that kind of stuff.

7106
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Um,

7107
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:44,000
like it is part of that sort of story of all of that.

7108
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Um,

7109
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:45,000
so,

7110
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,000
um,

7111
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:46,000
yeah,

7112
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,000
that's the,

7113
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:47,000
that's,

7114
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:48,000
that's kind of the main thing with that.

7115
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Yeah.

7116
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:56,000
This idea of like sustaining the content you want to do by doing it is a little different to how it's been in P1 a lot of time where it's like you had to fuel it by going back to maps.

7117
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Right,

7118
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:57,000
right,

7119
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:57,000
right.

7120
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Yeah.

7121
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Get your old juice.

7122
02:49:58,000 --> 02:49:58,000
I mean,

7123
02:49:58,000 --> 02:49:59,000
you're still doing maps ultimately,

7124
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:00,000
you know,

7125
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:00,000
in terms of like,

7126
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:01,000
but yeah,

7127
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:01,000
but,

7128
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:01,000
but effectively,

7129
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:02,000
like,

7130
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:03,000
so long as you're doing the content that you,

7131
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:03,000
um,

7132
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:04,000
uh,

7133
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:05,000
that you,

7134
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:06,000
that you want to do,

7135
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:06,000
you should,

7136
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:06,000
and,

7137
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,000
and as well,

7138
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:08,000
and making it harder.

7139
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Um,

7140
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:08,000
you know,

7141
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
so your build has to be good enough to be able to,

7142
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:11,000
to be able to sustain it.

7143
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:11,000
Then,

7144
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
then you will be able to sustain that stuff.

7145
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:13,000
And,

7146
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:13,000
you know,

7147
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:13,000
uh,

7148
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
like if you want every single map to have a breach in it,

7149
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:16,000
that's absolutely doable.

7150
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Um,

7151
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:17,000
by,

7152
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:17,000
uh,

7153
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:18,000
by,

7154
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:18,000
by,

7155
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:18,000
by,

7156
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:18,000
by,

7157
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,000
you know,

7158
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:20,000
using the tablets correctly.

7159
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Yeah.

7160
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:21,000
So the,

7161
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:21,000
um,

7162
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:27,000
atlas passive trees and the trees for each of the distinct types of content is about scaling the reward and difficulty primarily.

7163
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Yeah.

7164
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Yeah.

7165
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Yeah.

7166
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Yeah.

7167
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Absolutely.

7168
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Um,

7169
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,000
and what does,

7170
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I saw like on the breach nodes,

7171
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,000
it said like increased difficulty.

7172
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,000
What does that mean?

7173
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:36,000
Um,

7174
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
it's somewhat arbitrary and asymmetric,

7175
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:40,000
but,

7176
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:40,000
um,

7177
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:41,000
it will feel like,

7178
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:42,000
for example,

7179
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:46,000
some of the difficulties will actually change the boss's skills and how they work.

7180
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Um,

7181
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:50,000
generally that will increase like the level of the area,

7182
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:50,000
right?

7183
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,000
So you get the general,

7184
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:51,000
uh,

7185
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,000
monster and life scaling.

7186
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Um,

7187
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:54,000
but,

7188
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:54,000
uh,

7189
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
arguably to a player that's arbitrary as well,

7190
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:57,000
cause they don't know how that scales.

7191
02:50:58,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Um,

7192
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:00,000
uh,

7193
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:03,000
and another context here might be more of certain monster types,

7194
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
less of others and stuff like that.

7195
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Um,

7196
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,000
it is generally,

7197
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,000
uh,

7198
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:07,000
that,

7199
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:07,000
yeah,

7200
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:11,000
so the small nodes will increase difficulty of the meta content,

7201
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,000
whereas the large,

7202
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
the notables will increase the reward of the in map content.

7203
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Um,

7204
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:16,000
but when I say difficulty,

7205
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
that is reward as well.

7206
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:18,000
So,

7207
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:21,000
an example of how this works is like,

7208
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:22,000
um,

7209
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:25,000
let's say the boss has six uniques it could drop,

7210
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,000
or five or six uniques.

7211
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Um,

7212
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,000
it can drop three at difficulty zero.

7213
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Then at say,

7214
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:30,000
um,

7215
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:31,000
difficulty one,

7216
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:32,000
it can drop,

7217
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:33,000
you know,

7218
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
maybe has increased level or higher item level,

7219
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:36,000
um,

7220
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:36,000
some rarity.

7221
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Um,

7222
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:38,000
you know,

7223
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
now also that when I say rarity,

7224
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:44,000
also do note rarity does increase the grade of items,

7225
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:47,000
not just making them yellow or orange.

7226
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
It does make them better yellows or better or,

7227
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:49,000
uh,

7228
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:49,000
no,

7229
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:50,000
not better oranges.

7230
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Um,

7231
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:51,000
it does affect,

7232
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:52,000
yeah,

7233
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
it affects other things about items than just the rarity.

7234
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Yes.

7235
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Um,

7236
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:56,000
and so,

7237
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:56,000
yeah,

7238
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:57,000
when I talk about just getting rarity here,

7239
02:51:58,000 --> 02:51:58,000
I don't want people to,

7240
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
and PeeWee1 players in particular to think,

7241
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:00,000
ah,

7242
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
they're just going to go from yellow to more yellow.

7243
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Um,

7244
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:04,000
so anyway,

7245
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:05,000
and you know,

7246
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
maybe the next tier will add a unique to the pool,

7247
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:08,000
like a more,

7248
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:09,000
uh,

7249
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:09,000
you know,

7250
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
what we hope will be more valuable unique.

7251
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
And then the next one can do a bit more rarity,

7252
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:14,000
something else,

7253
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
maybe introduce a different unique perhaps.

7254
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:20,000
And then the last difficulty introduces something ideally,

7255
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:21,000
you know,

7256
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
without giving away exact specifics of them,

7257
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
more in the line of a,

7258
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:26,000
um,

7259
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,000
modular unique item,

7260
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,000
say like megalomaniac or like,

7261
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:31,000
um,

7262
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
forbidden flesh and flame from PeeWee1.

7263
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:37,000
So a unique item that is like ideally very powerful,

7264
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:37,000
very chase.

7265
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Um,

7266
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,000
but,

7267
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:39,000
uh,

7268
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
has a lot of different combinations.

7269
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Watchers eyes,

7270
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:42,000
another good example,

7271
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:42,000
right?

7272
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
So a new series of jewels,

7273
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:45,000
um,

7274
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:46,000
is a good example.

7275
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
There are other uniques that are modular and stuff,

7276
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:49,000
and that comes in at the last tier.

7277
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
And so you want to really be getting to that hardest difficulty.

7278
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
So you can be getting these like,

7279
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
farming for these extremely good,

7280
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:56,000
powerful,

7281
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:57,000
unique items.

7282
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Um,

7283
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
but of course you have the thing if you're never ready for it.

7284
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:02,000
If you try it and you're like,

7285
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:02,000
oh,

7286
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:03,000
this is too hard.

7287
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:04,000
You can always just respect the nodes.

7288
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:06,000
You can unspec them away and,

7289
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:06,000
uh,

7290
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,000
then not,

7291
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:07,000
you know,

7292
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:07,000
like,

7293
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:08,000
uh,

7294
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:09,000
just effectively decide,

7295
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:09,000
like,

7296
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,000
I've got these points,

7297
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:10,000
but,

7298
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:10,000
um,

7299
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:10,000
I'm not,

7300
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,000
yeah,

7301
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I want,

7302
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:12,000
I want to go back and do this later.

7303
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
And so that ability to effectively configure the difficulty like that,

7304
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:15,000
I think.

7305
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
So if you're maybe target farming one of the base,

7306
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:18,000
one of the uniques,

7307
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,000
the difficulty zero drops,

7308
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,000
you might want to just be like,

7309
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:21,000
I'll do that.

7310
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:24,000
I'll do the difficulty stuff later and I'll just farm it at this difficulty.

7311
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:25,000
So,

7312
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:25,000
and I,

7313
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
I think that's a much better way than the,

7314
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
than some of the systems we've used to scale that in the past.

7315
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:30,000
And the nice thing is,

7316
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:30,000
of course,

7317
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
the difficulty is that we can effectively get what,

7318
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:35,000
use whatever scaling levers we want to make that more difficult without

7319
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:36,000
necessarily having,

7320
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:36,000
like,

7321
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:36,000
like,

7322
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:37,000
because we could have been like,

7323
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Oh,

7324
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:38,000
you know,

7325
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:38,000
you increase the difficulty.

7326
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
It's like 200% life or something like that.

7327
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
But by effectively being a bit more vague about it,

7328
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:45,000
we can actually like specifically tailor the difficulties of the different

7329
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:45,000
tiers,

7330
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:45,000
like,

7331
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:45,000
you know,

7332
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,000
with more specific changes.

7333
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Yeah.

7334
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
This like multiple projectile thingy shoots has more projectiles.

7335
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:49,000
Sure.

7336
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:50,000
And that kind of thing.

7337
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:50,000
So,

7338
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:50,000
you know,

7339
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:50,000
we just,

7340
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:53,000
whatever we feel works best for making this particular fight more difficult.

7341
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
It seems like there's a lot more for players to kind of discover

7342
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
experimentally there as they progress.

7343
02:53:58,000 --> 02:53:58,000
For sure.

7344
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:00,000
In what way they're getting harder.

7345
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,000
And that,

7346
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:01,000
um,

7347
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
it's going to be different for different players too,

7348
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:06,000
where like a different build is affected by a difficulty change more so than others.

7349
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Potentially.

7350
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:07,000
And,

7351
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:08,000
uh,

7352
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:08,000
that,

7353
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
that's an interesting question as well.

7354
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:14,000
I think where how much are you guys pitching these sorts of distinct end game pieces of

7355
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:20,000
content at being like completable by the same build or by encouraging players to make a

7356
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:21,000
different build that's better at certain.

7357
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:22,000
So this is,

7358
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:23,000
this is a very difficult one.

7359
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Um,

7360
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:23,000
and,

7361
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:24,000
uh,

7362
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:28,000
it's something that we've discussed a bit recently is like the harder you make the

7363
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,000
hardest content,

7364
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:32,000
the less builds will be considered viable by the players because,

7365
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:32,000
um,

7366
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
effectively like a build's only viable if it can defeat like,

7367
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:35,000
you know,

7368
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
the,

7369
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:38,000
the pinnacle boss at difficulty for,

7370
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:38,000
like,

7371
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:39,000
that will be kind of the general perception.

7372
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:41,000
So we have to be really like,

7373
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,000
I actually don't know necessarily what the right answer here is.

7374
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Um,

7375
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:45,000
like we,

7376
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:45,000
uh,

7377
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:46,000
have the ability.

7378
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:46,000
I mean,

7379
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,000
maybe you feel like you do,

7380
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:48,000
but I don't think I,

7381
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:51,000
I wouldn't say I'm a hundred percent confident on it,

7382
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:51,000
but like,

7383
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:52,000
you know,

7384
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:53,000
I'll,

7385
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:53,000
I'll,

7386
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:54,000
I'll have a go at it.

7387
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Look,

7388
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,000
there's going to be iteration here because what we'll see is like,

7389
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:57,000
you know,

7390
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:58,000
if we find that like,

7391
02:54:58,000 --> 02:54:59,000
um,

7392
02:54:59,000 --> 02:54:59,000
you know,

7393
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
there's only like some particularly abusive,

7394
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:06,000
like only the most abusive stuff is possibly able to defeat the hardest content that we might have to dial it back a bit.

7395
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Yeah.

7396
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Um,

7397
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:12,000
but it's kind of going to be a bit of experimentation and it's very hard at this point to be able to pitch that because we don't have the,

7398
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:12,000
um,

7399
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:13,000
crazy history.

7400
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:13,000
you know,

7401
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Pee Wee 2 does not have the history of Pee Wee 1 to be able to,

7402
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:16,000
you know,

7403
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:17,000
to know kind of what,

7404
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:22,000
like what is the right life value to have on a difficulty for pinnacle boss?

7405
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Like,

7406
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:25,000
how do we even know that at this point really without,

7407
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:25,000
you know,

7408
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:26,000
that being said though,

7409
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:30,000
like the bosses are a lot more skill based and tactical,

7410
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:30,000
right?

7411
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Like at the end of the day,

7412
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:32,000
uh,

7413
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:39,000
the gear is to some degree necessary because no one can really make no mistake for some amount of time,

7414
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:40,000
you know?

7415
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
So you do have that thing and you do need to mitigate certain things,

7416
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:45,000
but like a lot of these are like very dodge roll tactical,

7417
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:46,000
um,

7418
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:50,000
or using certain skills or mitigation tactics or whatever you do.

7419
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,000
There's heaps of different things to bypass the things that make them hard for sure.

7420
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
But I would say it is very much,

7421
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
a lot of skill is involved.

7422
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Um,

7423
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:02,000
especially when it comes to some of these with dodge rolling,

7424
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
like I'm trying to emphasize that quite a bit,

7425
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:05,000
um,

7426
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:05,000
or blocking,

7427
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:06,000
you know,

7428
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:07,000
if you want to do a different way about it,

7429
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:08,000
um,

7430
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,000
not to say you must block,

7431
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:09,000
but yes,

7432
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
dodge roll is a pretty key mechanic here.

7433
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:14,000
And I'd say we're certainly upping the emphasis on using and using it well,

7434
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,000
as you get into these higher tiers,

7435
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
but gears,

7436
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:21,000
always a way in combinations of uniques and passive tree and build is always a way to go.

7437
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:23,000
I'm not good at dodge rolling.

7438
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:28,000
I'm going to gear around that skill check and become strong enough to defeat the boss,

7439
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:28,000
you know,

7440
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:29,000
or another skill,

7441
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:33,000
like some sort of skill that helps you block using skills in the mix is fine.

7442
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Yeah.

7443
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:36,000
But I would say pretty generally you can take,

7444
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:37,000
I'd say any decent character,

7445
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:38,000
you get pretty damn,

7446
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
you gear up all the way.

7447
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:41,000
And as long as you're good enough,

7448
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
that is a way to defeat them.

7449
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:47,000
I would say there's no real hard requirement on doing something crazy niche or out there or complicated.

7450
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:48,000
You're certainly not going the route of like,

7451
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:49,000
Oh,

7452
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:50,000
this boss is fire immune or something.

7453
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Oh,

7454
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:51,000
no,

7455
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:51,000
no,

7456
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:51,000
no,

7457
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:51,000
no,

7458
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:52,000
no,

7459
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:52,000
no,

7460
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:52,000
no,

7461
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:52,000
no,

7462
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:52,000
no,

7463
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:53,000
no,

7464
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:53,000
no,

7465
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7466
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7467
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7468
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7469
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7470
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7471
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7472
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7473
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7474
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7475
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7476
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7477
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:54,000
no,

7478
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:55,000
no,

7479
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:55,000
no,

7480
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
no,

7481
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:57,000
no,

7482
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:04,000
map-esque Atlas,

7483
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:06,000
which I know you're particularly fond of,

7484
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Jonathan.

7485
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Yep.

7486
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:09,000
What's the,

7487
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
what's kind of the idea here?

7488
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:11,000
Like,

7489
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:12,000
is the layout the same for everyone?

7490
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Is it the same across the league?

7491
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
So it's the same for all your characters in the league,

7492
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
but the layout is different for everyone.

7493
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:18,000
It is random.

7494
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Oh,

7495
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:18,000
okay.

7496
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:19,000
So you're going to have to find stuff.

7497
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Like,

7498
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,000
it works like Delve in this respect,

7499
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
which is obviously a league that I was particularly a fan of.

7500
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Yeah.

7501
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:24,000
So,

7502
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:24,000
yeah,

7503
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:25,000
I'm just a really,

7504
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:25,000
I,

7505
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I,

7506
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I,

7507
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:30,000
what I really wanted is I wanted a feeling of exploration in the Atlas.

7508
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
And it's something,

7509
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:37,000
that we sort of tried to do with the Atlas and Peewee 1 with that feeling of kind of,

7510
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:37,000
you know,

7511
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
having the connected areas and exploring,

7512
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:39,000
but it never really,

7513
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:42,000
it didn't feel like exploration quite in quite the same way that this does.

7514
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Yeah.

7515
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
So that's the feeling I loved.

7516
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:45,000
And it's,

7517
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:46,000
it's one of the reasons I love Delve.

7518
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:48,000
And so that's,

7519
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:48,000
you know,

7520
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:48,000
kind of,

7521
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:50,000
kind of where this was coming from.

7522
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,000
And at the same time,

7523
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:55,000
it's sort of solving various other problems that we've always had where,

7524
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:56,000
like,

7525
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:59,000
one of the things that's really cool to do is to be able to have things like,

7526
02:57:59,000 --> 02:57:59,000
okay,

7527
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:01,000
like in this area,

7528
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
you've got like this item drops and like that kind of thing,

7529
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:03,000
you know,

7530
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,000
like I guess in Peewee 1,

7531
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:04,000
you had div cards,

7532
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:11,000
but yet there was always a problem where if you have differences between in-game areas in a system that works like Peewee 1 does,

7533
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
then effectively that's the only map people,

7534
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:14,000
like whatever the best map is,

7535
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
that's the one everyone will run continuously forever.

7536
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
So effectively,

7537
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:24,000
we wanted to try and make sure that you actually like had an experience that had more variety while still retaining the whole,

7538
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:24,000
like,

7539
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:25,000
I get to play the content that I want.

7540
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:27,000
So ideally with the,

7541
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:28,000
with the Atlas,

7542
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:29,000
we kind of get that we've got in Peewee 2,

7543
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:32,000
we get to kind of have both of the best of both worlds.

7544
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:33,000
We get to make sure that there is some variety,

7545
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:34,000
you know,

7546
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:35,000
you feel like you're exploring,

7547
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:36,000
but because once you've run a map,

7548
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
that's run and now you have to,

7549
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:38,000
you know,

7550
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:39,000
move on and find another one.

7551
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:41,000
It's not just like the,

7552
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:41,000
you know,

7553
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:44,000
like just play one map again and again and again,

7554
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:45,000
but yet the content,

7555
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:45,000
you know,

7556
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:46,000
can be added to it.

7557
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:46,000
You can do things,

7558
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
if you like the,

7559
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:48,000
you know,

7560
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:48,000
particular maps,

7561
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:49,000
you know,

7562
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
because there are biomes and you can see them from far away,

7563
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:51,000
you can be like,

7564
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:51,000
okay,

7565
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,000
I know there's a particular desert map.

7566
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:53,000
That's great.

7567
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
So I'm going to go for deserts and that's fine.

7568
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:55,000
You can do that kind of thing.

7569
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:56,000
So,

7570
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:57,000
you know,

7571
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:57,000
like you've,

7572
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:58,000
you've both got controllability,

7573
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:59,000
but also,

7574
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:00,000
you know,

7575
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
the ability for us to kind of make more variants.

7576
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:05,000
You get a lot more very high satisfying spikes.

7577
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:05,000
Yeah.

7578
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Well,

7579
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:07,000
like for example,

7580
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:08,000
you get more variables where you just have,

7581
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:08,000
okay,

7582
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
there are like four towers really.

7583
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:14,000
You've got a good tower cluster and you've got really good maps in,

7584
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:15,000
in that range.

7585
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:16,000
So like,

7586
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:17,000
you know,

7587
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:18,000
there are maps.

7588
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:19,000
So in,

7589
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:20,000
in PathXL1,

7590
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:20,000
for example,

7591
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
you know,

7592
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
the range is effectively say,

7593
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
how do I quantify this?

7594
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Like say 350 monsters up to 700 monsters.

7595
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Yeah.

7596
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:33,000
Whereas the range here is like 300 monsters up to like,

7597
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
1500 monsters,

7598
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:36,000
you know,

7599
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:36,000
much,

7600
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:36,000
much,

7601
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:37,000
much more drastic range.

7602
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Now those numbers are arbitrary,

7603
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,000
but it is approximately the representation of the range.

7604
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:45,000
Obviously you then modified and add more to it and all of that.

7605
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:49,000
So you will have some maps that are like extremely good with Delirium.

7606
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Um,

7607
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:50,000
um,

7608
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:53,000
and some maps that are like way better with something more like breach.

7609
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:54,000
Yeah.

7610
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Because Delirium enhances the monsters of the map.

7611
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Whereas breach entirely adds the monsters.

7612
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:03,000
And you will even have things where there are maps that are like way more magic monsters,

7613
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:04,000
way more rare monsters.

7614
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,000
And so you probably want that with,

7615
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:07,000
you know,

7616
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
pick your league of your choosing and whatnot.

7617
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
You have all these variables that are at play.

7618
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:16,000
And so you all of a sudden find a really good set of towers with some really good maps and radius.

7619
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:19,000
And then you'll get really good tablet modifiers.

7620
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:22,000
And then you'll get really good maps with really good prefixes.

7621
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:25,000
And you want to just combine all of us and to,

7622
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:28,000
and you obviously instill them all and you corrupt them all.

7623
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
And there's the corruption influence.

7624
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:30,000
We didn't show that.

7625
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
And so then there's a corruption influence on them.

7626
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:33,000
And it's like,

7627
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:34,000
yeah,

7628
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:34,000
okay.

7629
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:37,000
Like it is possible for this on one map to be many,

7630
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:40,000
many mechanics stacks to the point of craziness.

7631
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Hmm.

7632
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:41,000
So it sounds like the,

7633
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:42,000
the juicing is definitely there.

7634
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:43,000
Well,

7635
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:43,000
yeah,

7636
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:43,000
I mean,

7637
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:43,000
that's,

7638
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:44,000
that's important,

7639
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:44,000
right?

7640
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:45,000
I mean,

7641
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
like that's part of the PeeWee experience.

7642
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Yeah.

7643
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:49,000
For a hundred percent.

7644
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:50,000
But,

7645
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:50,000
uh,

7646
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:51,000
how,

7647
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:52,000
um,

7648
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:53,000
how much control do you have as a player though,

7649
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:57,000
over min-maxing your just exploration of the Atlas map?

7650
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:58,000
So effectively,

7651
03:00:58,000 --> 03:00:58,000
um,

7652
03:00:58,000 --> 03:00:59,000
can you do better in some way?

7653
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Um,

7654
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:03,000
so effectively what you're going to be wanting to do is the towers are where you go to like

7655
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:04,000
see areas around.

7656
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,000
And then there's the,

7657
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:06,000
the,

7658
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:06,000
the,

7659
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
the structure of the connections is quite open.

7660
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:09,000
So like you can beeline for things,

7661
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:09,000
um,

7662
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:10,000
pretty well.

7663
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:11,000
Like if you,

7664
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
like you can certainly see a lot more maps than what you play,

7665
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:14,000
if you know what I mean.

7666
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Um,

7667
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:15,000
so,

7668
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:15,000
uh,

7669
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:16,000
because of that,

7670
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:16,000
um,

7671
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:16,000
like,

7672
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:17,000
you know,

7673
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:18,000
choosing what you want is,

7674
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:18,000
is,

7675
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:18,000
is,

7676
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:18,000
is,

7677
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:19,000
is,

7678
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:20,000
is easy to do.

7679
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
And you can kind of see the towers in the fog.

7680
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Yes.

7681
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
You can see the towers in the fog from a distance,

7682
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:25,000
which means that,

7683
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:25,000
um,

7684
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:25,000
you know,

7685
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:26,000
you don't like a lot of the time it's like,

7686
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:27,000
you know,

7687
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:27,000
go to a tower,

7688
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,000
you'll see some maps you want to play.

7689
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:29,000
You go play those.

7690
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Then it's like the next tower is just a few other maps away.

7691
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Go to that tower,

7692
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:32,000
see the,

7693
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:33,000
see the next area and so on.

7694
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
I'm guessing that's like a certain range out.

7695
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:35,000
You can see.

7696
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:35,000
Yeah.

7697
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:35,000
Yeah.

7698
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
The fog kind of lift,

7699
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:37,000
uh,

7700
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:38,000
in 3d kind of,

7701
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:39,000
the fog's actually a 3d thing and it like,

7702
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:43,000
it like rises slowly as he gets away from where the thing is.

7703
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:44,000
So that's how you kind of get the towers to.

7704
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Oh,

7705
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:45,000
so you,

7706
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
you might see a cluster of towers off somewhere.

7707
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Yeah,

7708
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,000
absolutely.

7709
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:48,000
You can see that.

7710
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:54,000
It sounds like this is like potentially an infinitely expanding map that is going to be by the end of someone's league quite big.

7711
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,000
Yes.

7712
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:55,000
Um,

7713
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,000
so we haven't,

7714
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:57,000
we actually need to add a search feature.

7715
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:00,000
I don't know if they've done it yet for finding specific maps that haven't been run yet.

7716
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
We have a few things.

7717
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:05,000
There's a button you can press and it like goes to your last map round one that goes back to a home,

7718
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
base and one that goes to some of the special,

7719
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:09,000
uh,

7720
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:09,000
you know,

7721
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:10,000
more iconic things you find.

7722
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:10,000
But,

7723
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:11,000
um,

7724
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:11,000
this,

7725
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:12,000
we certainly need more,

7726
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:13,000
um,

7727
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:14,000
a hundred percent.

7728
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
So that is something we will be working on.

7729
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Hopefully it's there.

7730
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:19,000
Who knows?

7731
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:20,000
And,

7732
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:20,000
uh,

7733
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
so way stones have a tier,

7734
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
but they don't have specific maps on them anymore,

7735
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:27,000
which obviously shrinks that whole map pool thing down substantially.

7736
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:28,000
Um,

7737
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:29,000
it'll make,

7738
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
it'll make the maps dash tab a little easier to manage.

7739
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:32,000
Yeah.

7740
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:33,000
So,

7741
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:33,000
uh,

7742
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:33,000
that's good.

7743
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Yeah.

7744
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:34,000
So,

7745
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:35,000
uh,

7746
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:35,000
the,

7747
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
have you thought about like what sort of,

7748
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:37,000
I don't know,

7749
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:40,000
economic consequences that have for like how players progress through maps?

7750
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:45,000
Is it easier to do when you don't have to collect all of these individual maps to get the completion bonuses and stuff like we do currently?

7751
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Like we have that whole,

7752
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:47,000
you know,

7753
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
hunting down over a hundred maps to get completion for.

7754
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:50,000
I mean,

7755
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:50,000
yeah,

7756
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:51,000
now you're hunting,

7757
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:51,000
you know,

7758
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
you're hunting certain valuable maps,

7759
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:54,000
you're hunting towers,

7760
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:56,000
you're hunting content,

7761
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:57,000
you're hunting,

7762
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:57,000
um,

7763
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:58,000
you know,

7764
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:58,000
the,

7765
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:59,000
the warlord,

7766
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,000
the faction leaders to,

7767
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:01,000
to get the pinnacle.

7768
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:02,000
Yeah.

7769
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:02,000
You know,

7770
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:02,000
you're hunting,

7771
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:03,000
uh,

7772
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:03,000
unique maps,

7773
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:05,000
very different thing for sure.

7774
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:06,000
Um,

7775
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:07,000
as opposed to,

7776
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:08,000
and then the item is all about,

7777
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:09,000
I've just got a key.

7778
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:11,000
I just want good modifiers.

7779
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:11,000
You know,

7780
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:14,000
there's not really all that whole other variable to it.

7781
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:14,000
So there's still a lot of,

7782
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
a lot of interesting choice and axes.

7783
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:16,000
Um,

7784
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:20,000
but we've taken it from the item and put it on the actual world map.

7785
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:20,000
Um,

7786
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:21,000
but it's cool.

7787
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
It also makes you just feel like you're traversing a world,

7788
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:24,000
you know,

7789
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
you're not instantly like finishing the campaign,

7790
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:27,000
very grounded.

7791
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:28,000
And now I'm in space,

7792
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:29,000
you know,

7793
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:30,000
like public.

7794
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:30,000
I was going to ask,

7795
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
I only literally just thought about that.

7796
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:33,000
I was going to ask about that.

7797
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:33,000
So,

7798
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:34,000
you know,

7799
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:38,000
the mapping system was always this like extra dimensional kind of unknown thing.

7800
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:39,000
It's pretty interesting,

7801
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:40,000
but it is a little weird.

7802
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
So we wanted to start with actually like,

7803
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:42,000
at least,

7804
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:43,000
I mean,

7805
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:43,000
look,

7806
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
I'm sure we'll get to the extra dimensional beings eventually,

7807
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,000
but,

7808
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:46,000
um,

7809
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:47,000
but,

7810
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:47,000
uh,

7811
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:48,000
at least to start with,

7812
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:48,000
you know,

7813
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:48,000
we,

7814
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:49,000
uh,

7815
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:50,000
have a bit more grounded initially.

7816
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:51,000
Yes.

7817
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:51,000
So,

7818
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:52,000
you're on the planet,

7819
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,000
right?

7820
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:54,000
You're on the planet.

7821
03:03:54,000 --> 03:04:01,000
We haven't gone to the moon yet.

7822
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Well,

7823
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:03,000
even then we were saying like,

7824
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,000
can we at least,

7825
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
at least before we go to outer space,

7826
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,000
go to the moon first.

7827
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:09,000
Whoa,

7828
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:09,000
actually,

7829
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:09,000
well,

7830
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:10,000
how many moons are,

7831
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:11,000
we don't know.

7832
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:11,000
There's,

7833
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:14,000
there's a whole complicated thing we need to figure out there.

7834
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:14,000
Oh,

7835
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
I feel like there's a delve,

7836
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:18,000
but up league coming.

7837
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:21,000
All right.

7838
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:22,000
So we've got this,

7839
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:23,000
uh,

7840
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:24,000
one in four maps is boss maps.

7841
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:25,000
And then the,

7842
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
that means the other three are not boss maps.

7843
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:27,000
Yes.

7844
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
What does a non boss map look like?

7845
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:29,000
How do you win it?

7846
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
So effectively what you need to do is,

7847
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:31,000
um,

7848
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:32,000
kill the,

7849
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:32,000
uh,

7850
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:33,000
kill the rares,

7851
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:33,000
um,

7852
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:34,000
in the map to,

7853
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:35,000
to remove the corruption and finish it.

7854
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:36,000
Um,

7855
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:37,000
once you get down below 50 monsters,

7856
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:38,000
it will point out,

7857
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:38,000
uh,

7858
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:39,000
any rares that are remaining.

7859
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:41,000
There'll be a little marker just so you know.

7860
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:42,000
I was worried about that.

7861
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:42,000
Honestly,

7862
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:46,000
I wouldn't expect that to even be necessary most of the time because the layouts are kind of designed so that,

7863
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:46,000
you know,

7864
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:47,000
like,

7865
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:47,000
you know,

7866
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:48,000
if you generally speaking,

7867
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
you want to clear the maps to find the rares anyway,

7868
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:50,000
because those are the one,

7869
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:50,000
you know,

7870
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:51,000
those have good drops.

7871
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:52,000
Um,

7872
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:53,000
and effectively,

7873
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:53,000
um,

7874
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:54,000
the,

7875
03:04:54,000 --> 03:05:00,000
the only reason that you would need that marker thing is just occasionally you get some slightly weird degenerate layout where there's some side bit you didn't notice or something like that.

7876
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:00,000
And that's like,

7877
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:01,000
that's where you have to go.

7878
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:02,000
So generally speaking,

7879
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:03,000
you'll be able to make your way around and kill them all.

7880
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:06,000
The goal of the player is you're cleansing corruption from the world.

7881
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,000
You're bringing water back,

7882
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:08,000
um,

7883
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:08,000
you know,

7884
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:09,000
stuff like that.

7885
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
So you even get the thing on the map where you're like,

7886
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:12,000
you know,

7887
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:15,000
there's some corruption-y looking stuff around the map.

7888
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:16,000
When you complete the map,

7889
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:17,000
that gets purged away.

7890
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:17,000
Um,

7891
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:18,000
you know,

7892
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
so you feel like you're reverse painting the map a little bit.

7893
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:20,000
Oh,

7894
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:21,000
we're cleaning up.

7895
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:27,000
It can actually be quite satisfying as you're like changing all the nodes from one color to another and you're like,

7896
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:27,000
yeah,

7897
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:27,000
this is fun.

7898
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:27,000
I'm like,

7899
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:28,000
you know.

7900
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:28,000
Ultimately,

7901
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:30,000
what we wanted to do is,

7902
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:30,000
um,

7903
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
we wanted boss combat in PoE 2 to matter when we have it.

7904
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:33,000
Yeah.

7905
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:34,000
And so in order,

7906
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:35,000
like if you have a map,

7907
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:36,000
uh,

7908
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:36,000
boss every area,

7909
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
then if we made it so the boss combat mattered enough,

7910
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
like in order to actually balance it that way,

7911
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:41,000
it's,

7912
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:42,000
it's too much.

7913
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
Like it actually is like,

7914
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:44,000
you know,

7915
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:44,000
you,

7916
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
you spend too much of your time fighting bosses.

7917
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Yeah.

7918
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Um,

7919
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:48,000
so effectively if,

7920
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:49,000
if that's what you want to do now,

7921
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:50,000
you can do it because there's bosses there.

7922
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:51,000
You know,

7923
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:52,000
like when I say one of four maps is a map boss,

7924
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
that doesn't mean that one of four maps you play is one.

7925
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:54,000
Um,

7926
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:55,000
because you know,

7927
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
obviously you can pick what content you're doing by exploring around.

7928
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:57,000
You can chain the map boss.

7929
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
You're picking your path and your path.

7930
03:05:59,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Yeah,

7931
03:05:59,000 --> 03:05:59,000
exactly.

7932
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:00,000
So effectively if,

7933
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:01,000
if you want to hunt the bosses,

7934
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:02,000
then that is the thing you can do.

7935
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:02,000
Um,

7936
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:05,000
if you want to just like do some mindless grinding for a while,

7937
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:05,000
uh,

7938
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:06,000
you can do that too.

7939
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:09,000
And what it means is we can actually make the bosses way more rewarding.

7940
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:09,000
Uh,

7941
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:13,000
they can drop way more items than they were going to because of the fact that there's not one at the end of every area,

7942
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:13,000
right?

7943
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:14,000
And then,

7944
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:14,000
and the,

7945
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:15,000
the fight is substantial.

7946
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:16,000
You get a lot of drops.

7947
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:16,000
Um,

7948
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:17,000
so,

7949
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:17,000
uh,

7950
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:18,000
that actually is something.

7951
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,000
And they get their own tree and they,

7952
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:20,000
what?

7953
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Oh yeah,

7954
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:21,000
I don't know.

7955
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:21,000
Right.

7956
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:21,000
You mean the boss,

7957
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:22,000
the boss killing tree.

7958
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:22,000
Yes.

7959
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:23,000
There's a tree for boss hunting.

7960
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:24,000
Sorry.

7961
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:25,000
I thought you meant every boss had its own tree.

7962
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:26,000
I was like,

7963
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:26,000
geez,

7964
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:27,000
did you do some design?

7965
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:27,000
Well,

7966
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:28,000
I wasn't looking at it.

7967
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:29,000
Not yet.

7968
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:29,000
Josh was like,

7969
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:30,000
wait,

7970
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:30,000
no,

7971
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:30,000
wait,

7972
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:30,000
stop.

7973
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:32,000
It's too much.

7974
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,000
That's like a year three feature.

7975
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:35,000
Yeah.

7976
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:35,000
Okay.

7977
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:35,000
Okay.

7978
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:36,000
We'll keep that in mind.

7979
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:37,000
Um,

7980
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:38,000
yeah.

7981
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:39,000
So there's actually like a,

7982
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:42,000
I do love that there's a boss hunting cause I'm super into that.

7983
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
There's a boss hunting tree that you can fill out as well.

7984
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:45,000
So how do you get points on that?

7985
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:45,000
Like,

7986
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:46,000
yeah.

7987
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:46,000
So effectively,

7988
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:47,000
I mean,

7989
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:47,000
well,

7990
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:48,000
you can,

7991
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:48,000
um,

7992
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
you get a lot of points for the core tree.

7993
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
There's a core tree that affects all mapping.

7994
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:53,000
Um,

7995
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:54,000
that a lot of things like pack size,

7996
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:54,000
quantity,

7997
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:55,000
rarity,

7998
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
and you've got multiple keystones that,

7999
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:58,000
um,

8000
03:06:58,000 --> 03:06:59,000
all work can work together and all can do.

8001
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:00,000
So I think there's three of them.

8002
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:01,000
Uh,

8003
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
one plays on like corrupted maps.

8004
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
One plays on like prefixes and suffixes.

8005
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:07,000
And I can't remember what the other ones,

8006
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:08,000
the other one does right in this very moment.

8007
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Um,

8008
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:13,000
but you obviously get that core tree and then you have,

8009
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:13,000
you know,

8010
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:17,000
a boss tree and then obviously all the different league and pinnacle content

8011
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:17,000
trees.

8012
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:20,000
So you get those points by just completing maps.

8013
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:21,000
It just has a,

8014
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
you effectively get a quest.

8015
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Um,

8016
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:27,000
and effectively it's like you complete 10 maps.

8017
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:31,000
You get your first two points and then like complete X maps and one,

8018
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:31,000
you know,

8019
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
but of certain tiers,

8020
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
like at least tier one,

8021
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:35,000
at least tier two,

8022
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:36,000
at least tier three.

8023
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:37,000
Climb effectively where it's like,

8024
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:40,000
as you get up the higher tiers and clear maps of certain tiers,

8025
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:41,000
that's when you start getting points for the Atlas.

8026
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:43,000
And like may I say the third one,

8027
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:44,000
I,

8028
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:45,000
I can't remember the exact specifics.

8029
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:49,000
It's like complete this and defeat a boss or,

8030
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
and then later it's defeat at least five bosses at something.

8031
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:52,000
And you know,

8032
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:53,000
so killing bosses get generated.

8033
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:54,000
It sounds way better for a fresh start.

8034
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:57,000
So I'm not having to like go and get that estuary map that I missed or

8035
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:57,000
something.

8036
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:57,000
It's like,

8037
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Oh yeah,

8038
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:58,000
for sure.

8039
03:07:58,000 --> 03:07:58,000
I'm just,

8040
03:07:59,000 --> 03:07:59,000
I'm just doing content.

8041
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:00,000
I'm just doing good content.

8042
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
But it is kind of the analog of that in a way,

8043
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:03,000
because like,

8044
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:03,000
it's that feeling of like,

8045
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
I've got a system to progress through.

8046
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:05,000
Like I just need to,

8047
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:08,000
I need to meet these objectives and I'm getting,

8048
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,000
and I'm getting from that,

8049
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:09,000
you're getting the,

8050
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,000
you know,

8051
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:10,000
the Atlas,

8052
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
the Atlas passive points and so on.

8053
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:12,000
Cool.

8054
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:13,000
Um,

8055
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:13,000
so yeah,

8056
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:14,000
that's kind of the idea.

8057
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:14,000
Yeah.

8058
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:19,000
So you can really like focusing on map blasting with the bossless maps and,

8059
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:20,000
or,

8060
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:20,000
you know,

8061
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:21,000
or on bossing content if you want to,

8062
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
or on breaches or on.

8063
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
And you can always put a breach on a map with a boss,

8064
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:26,000
right?

8065
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:26,000
You can do both.

8066
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:27,000
Yeah.

8067
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:27,000
Like they can have,

8068
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:28,000
they can have,

8069
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:28,000
you can have,

8070
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
you can have every type of content in one map if you want.

8071
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:31,000
Yeah.

8072
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:32,000
Is like a boss map,

8073
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:37,000
a kind of like a distinct thing from like a regular map in terms of like the,

8074
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
the layout or the thing you've done?

8075
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
Technically they are separate,

8076
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
but generally speaking,

8077
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:44,000
um,

8078
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:45,000
like similar.

8079
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:46,000
They're basically the same,

8080
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:47,000
but they're pretty similar.

8081
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
So they'll be like a boss history and a non-boss history.

8082
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:49,000
Yeah.

8083
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:49,000
There are,

8084
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:52,000
there are some cases at the moment where there are some maps that can't have a

8085
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:52,000
boss.

8086
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Um,

8087
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:53,000
and it's just,

8088
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:54,000
we haven't done the,

8089
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,000
you know,

8090
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:55,000
the,

8091
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:58,000
the one that would go here is not in early access yet and that kind of thing.

8092
03:08:58,000 --> 03:08:59,000
But effectively,

8093
03:08:59,000 --> 03:08:59,000
um,

8094
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:00,000
you know,

8095
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:01,000
as I said,

8096
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:02,000
generally speaking,

8097
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:02,000
it'll be one in four.

8098
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:04,000
Okay.

8099
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:05,000
Excellent.

8100
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:06,000
Um,

8101
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:07,000
so I think,

8102
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:08,000
I think that covers,

8103
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:10,000
did I miss some things from,

8104
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:10,000
you've got like the,

8105
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:11,000
all the smaller,

8106
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:14,000
contents like the strong boxes and essences.

8107
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:14,000
Yeah.

8108
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:14,000
Yeah.

8109
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:17,000
So initially we actually had a design where everything,

8110
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:17,000
um,

8111
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:18,000
like even all the smaller content,

8112
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,000
there was still going to be icons for it on the tree.

8113
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:21,000
I was around the Atlas.

8114
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:21,000
Yeah.

8115
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:24,000
But we actually found that it meant that when you were actually exploring,

8116
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:24,000
it didn't kind of,

8117
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:26,000
it felt like there was nothing random to find.

8118
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:29,000
So we wanted to make sure we also have kind of just completely random stuff.

8119
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:29,000
Yeah.

8120
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
Like it doesn't have a progression system that you just run into randomly.

8121
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:32,000
Cause that's fun too.

8122
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
And I will probably be adding more stuff like that as well over time.

8123
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:35,000
That's just like,

8124
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:35,000
just the,

8125
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:38,000
I randomly encountered this and that was like not expected.

8126
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:40,000
So that's all the stuff on the core Atlas tree.

8127
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:40,000
Yeah.

8128
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:43,000
So you can kind of like see more of that if you want to.

8129
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:43,000
Yeah.

8130
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:44,000
Great.

8131
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:44,000
And,

8132
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:47,000
and often mods on the items as well.

8133
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:47,000
On map.

8134
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:48,000
Keep waystones.

8135
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:49,000
Yeah.

8136
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:49,000
Cool.

8137
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:50,000
Yep.

8138
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:51,000
Lots of different names.

8139
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:51,000
Maps,

8140
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:52,000
waystones,

8141
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:52,000
same thing.

8142
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:54,000
Yes.

8143
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:55,000
So I've had to keep thinking,

8144
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:57,000
kind of correcting myself about that.

8145
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:57,000
I was like,

8146
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:58,000
yeah,

8147
03:09:58,000 --> 03:09:58,000
I don't know.

8148
03:09:58,000 --> 03:09:58,000
I mean,

8149
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
internally we cut,

8150
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:02,000
we definitely call them maps all the time.

8151
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:02,000
The thing is,

8152
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:05,000
is that the only reason why it doesn't make sense thematically is because a map does imply

8153
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:06,000
it's of a specific location,

8154
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:08,000
whereas a waste can take you to anywhere.

8155
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:09,000
Yeah.

8156
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
So that's the reason why the name change had to happen.

8157
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:13,000
But I think that probably even players will probably just call them maps.

8158
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:14,000
I bet.

8159
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:15,000
Just cause you know,

8160
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:16,000
if that's the period.

8161
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:19,000
So we've got,

8162
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:22,000
we've got the breach delirium ritual expedition,

8163
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:25,000
those like leagues that maybe need a new name.

8164
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:25,000
Yep.

8165
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:30,000
Is there another one that you're just both personally really keen to bring back in the future?

8166
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:30,000
I mean,

8167
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:31,000
you know,

8168
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
like I've always wanted to have a delve again,

8169
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
but I kind of got a bit of that wish with the system.

8170
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:35,000
Yeah.

8171
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:37,000
It's also a very like,

8172
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:42,000
like content heavy league to make because you need to make tons of encounters and like doing it properly is a huge thing.

8173
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:43,000
But I mean,

8174
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:43,000
I look,

8175
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:44,000
I love incursion as well.

8176
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:45,000
It's one of my favorites.

8177
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:46,000
Like I'm keen for that.

8178
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:48,000
I don't know if there's anything new other than that you're really keen for.

8179
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:50,000
There's a lot,

8180
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,000
especially because there's a lot I can do with,

8181
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:53,000
we can do with all this new art,

8182
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:53,000
new monsters,

8183
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:54,000
new monsters,

8184
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:54,000
right?

8185
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:56,000
Like for example,

8186
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:57,000
if you just take Legion,

8187
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:58,000
Legion had all those five civilizations.

8188
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:02,000
We've now got an entire new array of vile monsters,

8189
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:03,000
vile bosses,

8190
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:03,000
et cetera,

8191
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:05,000
that we can use as a baseline.

8192
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:09,000
We've got way better consistent direction on what's going on there.

8193
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:09,000
You know,

8194
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:10,000
heaps of stuff,

8195
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:13,000
new animation and the capacities are just like out of control.

8196
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:14,000
But then you've got,

8197
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:15,000
okay,

8198
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:16,000
incursion.

8199
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:16,000
We've got,

8200
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:17,000
you know,

8201
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:21,000
awesome vile artwork we can use there and make that all awesome and nice.

8202
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:24,000
New corruption mechanics that we can extrapolate on.

8203
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:25,000
You don't want to have a roof as the boss anymore?

8204
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:26,000
No,

8205
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:27,000
you're not just going to have a floating roof.

8206
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:32,000
The Omnitex is just a small floating roof.

8207
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:33,000
Oh,

8208
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:35,000
you're keeping with the theme of vacuum cleaners.

8209
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:35,000
Wow.

8210
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:37,000
Standing and then the brood.

8211
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:38,000
Mistakes were made.

8212
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:40,000
Now we have minimum,

8213
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:43,000
like that's a world where you had super uniques with one or two skills.

8214
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:44,000
Yeah.

8215
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:44,000
Yeah.

8216
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:44,000
Right.

8217
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:45,000
I don't,

8218
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,000
there's only so much you can do with a floating roof.

8219
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:49,000
So anyway,

8220
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:49,000
and then,

8221
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:50,000
um,

8222
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:50,000
I don't know,

8223
03:11:51,000 --> 03:11:55,000
even like bestiary coming back with something because we've got all these awesome bosses,

8224
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:57,000
way grander in scale.

8225
03:11:57,000 --> 03:12:00,000
And you can do these more grand hunts for them as opposed to just like,

8226
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:00,000
Oh,

8227
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,000
I'm like in a city and there's a rare spider,

8228
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:02,000
you know,

8229
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:05,000
you can just get way,

8230
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:06,000
way more epic and way more,

8231
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:07,000
um,

8232
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:07,000
you know,

8233
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:12,000
involved in with all the new art and so much stuff to like bestiary too.

8234
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:15,000
That's like hunting big beasts and preparing for them and tracking them.

8235
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:18,000
That'd be pretty cool.

8236
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:18,000
Exactly.

8237
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:21,000
I definitely take some mercenary action to that.

8238
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:22,000
It'd be a good fit I feel.

8239
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:24,000
Hmm.

8240
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:25,000
All right.

8241
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:25,000
Well,

8242
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:26,000
there's lots for us to look forward to there.

8243
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:29,000
You have some kind of like penned already for adding to the beta.

8244
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:30,000
I mean,

8245
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:30,000
we,

8246
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:32,000
all plans can change,

8247
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:32,000
but,

8248
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:33,000
uh,

8249
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:33,000
there are absolutely,

8250
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:33,000
I mean,

8251
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:34,000
look that we've,

8252
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:34,000
we've,

8253
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:36,000
we've done things like commissioning art assets and so on.

8254
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:37,000
Like we've got,

8255
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:38,000
uh,

8256
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:39,000
stuff coming along.

8257
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:40,000
It's just a question of like,

8258
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:40,000
you know,

8259
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:41,000
when we actually get there,

8260
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:42,000
what's it going to look like?

8261
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:43,000
Yep.

8262
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:43,000
All right.

8263
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:44,000
Um,

8264
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:47,000
let's talk about crafting a little bit because you've done a lot there and it's,

8265
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:48,000
uh,

8266
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:49,000
pretty fundamental to the game,

8267
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:49,000
I think.

8268
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:50,000
Um,

8269
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:54,000
so what's the core of what you're trying to do with crafting in part of exile two compared

8270
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:55,000
to part of exile one?

8271
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:56,000
Uh,

8272
03:12:56,000 --> 03:13:00,000
kind of noting that you've really kind of stepped back from the idea of like reforging

8273
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:02,000
an item many times or scouring it.

8274
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:02,000
So,

8275
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:02,000
um,

8276
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:04,000
we really want to make it so that you're,

8277
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:04,000
you're,

8278
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,000
you're finding crafting items all the time.

8279
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:08,000
You're using those crafting items way more often than you were in POE1.

8280
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:09,000
Um,

8281
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:09,000
that,

8282
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:09,000
you know,

8283
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:10,000
you're like the,

8284
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:10,000
the,

8285
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:11,000
the,

8286
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:12,000
the game of,

8287
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:13,000
of like picking something up,

8288
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:14,000
like seeing what I could modify it to,

8289
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
like then actually equipping those items is just happening way more often.

8290
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:18,000
And there's so many subtle changes around this,

8291
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:19,000
like in terms of,

8292
03:13:19,000 --> 03:13:20,000
um,

8293
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:21,000
uh,

8294
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:22,000
just like the way that,

8295
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:25,000
the way that the base mod scale and items and the,

8296
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:25,000
you know,

8297
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:25,000
like things like that,

8298
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
like all the stuff to kind of make it so that,

8299
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:27,000
um,

8300
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:29,000
as you find new base types and new things,

8301
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:30,000
like you've got a reason to craft them,

8302
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:31,000
you know,

8303
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:32,000
part of that is making sure that,

8304
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:33,000
um,

8305
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:33,000
you know,

8306
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:34,000
you've got enough of that currency.

8307
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:35,000
Um,

8308
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:35,000
you know,

8309
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:40,000
it actually took us a long time to even get comfortable with the idea of making something like an exalt drop that often.

8310
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:41,000
Yeah.

8311
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:43,000
Cause there's just this thing in your cemented in your mind of like,

8312
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:44,000
um,

8313
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:44,000
you know,

8314
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:44,000
Oh,

8315
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:44,000
this is,

8316
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:45,000
this is rare,

8317
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:45,000
right?

8318
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:46,000
Like it's an exalt.

8319
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:47,000
How can it possibly drop like,

8320
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:47,000
you know,

8321
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:48,000
multiple times in act one?

8322
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:49,000
Um,

8323
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:49,000
you know,

8324
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:50,000
like it just,

8325
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:51,000
it just seems crazy.

8326
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:52,000
Um,

8327
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:52,000
but,

8328
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:53,000
uh,

8329
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:58,000
with the way like removing scouring affected so much of the way that we craft,

8330
03:13:58,000 --> 03:13:58,000
like,

8331
03:13:58,000 --> 03:13:59,000
I know,

8332
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:00,000
I know that you noted earlier that,

8333
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:00,000
um,

8334
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:00,000
you can,

8335
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:01,000
uh,

8336
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:04,000
there's so many more things you're allowed to craft now that you weren't allowed to before.

8337
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:04,000
you can craft relics.

8338
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:04,000
Yes.

8339
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:07,000
And the reason why that's allowed is because without scouring,

8340
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:08,000
um,

8341
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:10,000
like those crafts become one time things,

8342
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:12,000
which means that it's actually okay to allow for that stuff.

8343
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:14,000
And I think that's opened up a huge amount of stuff.

8344
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:14,000
You know,

8345
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:15,000
there's just,

8346
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:15,000
yeah,

8347
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:16,000
there's so many more types that can be crafted.

8348
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:19,000
It adds so much more valuable value to the dropped.

8349
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:19,000
Exactly.

8350
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:20,000
Exactly.

8351
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:20,000
So,

8352
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:21,000
um,

8353
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:21,000
that stuff has just,

8354
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
I think opened up a huge amount there.

8355
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:24,000
And,

8356
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:24,000
um,

8357
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:25,000
it also has,

8358
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:28,000
and this wasn't necessarily an explicit goal right at the beginning,

8359
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:29,000
but it's also made that the,

8360
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:29,000
the,

8361
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:30,000
the,

8362
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:31,000
the game of like,

8363
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:32,000
I'm just going to click,

8364
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:33,000
click,

8365
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:33,000
click,

8366
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:33,000
click,

8367
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
click again and again as my crafting session is no longer really the meta.

8368
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:36,000
It's a spam.

8369
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:37,000
Yeah,

8370
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:37,000
exactly.

8371
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:40,000
Like everything kind of is something that you want to be able to use.

8372
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:42,000
You are still reforging and meta crafting things.

8373
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:42,000
Oh yeah.

8374
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:43,000
Yeah.

8375
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:44,000
We've still got stuff like that,

8376
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:44,000
right?

8377
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:45,000
We've got a noles.

8378
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:46,000
But that stuff is higher up.

8379
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:47,000
Like that,

8380
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:48,000
that's kind of more of a,

8381
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:49,000
of a later game thing.

8382
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:50,000
Yeah,

8383
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:50,000
exactly.

8384
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:51,000
Um,

8385
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
cause you have to think about it after each time of like,

8386
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:54,000
will I improve this?

8387
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:54,000
Will I make it worse?

8388
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:54,000
Yeah.

8389
03:14:55,000 --> 03:14:55,000
Um,

8390
03:14:58,000 --> 03:14:58,000
something that,

8391
03:14:58,000 --> 03:14:58,000
um,

8392
03:14:58,000 --> 03:14:59,000
omens can do,

8393
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:00,000
um,

8394
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:01,000
is also very interesting.

8395
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:02,000
Like there's some pretty powerful stuff there,

8396
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:02,000
but once again,

8397
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:04,000
we introduced that stuff later on.

8398
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:05,000
And so effectively we want to,

8399
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:06,000
uh,

8400
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:06,000
you know,

8401
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:07,000
I guess for lack of better,

8402
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:09,000
democratize crafting at early levels,

8403
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:09,000
like make sure that,

8404
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:10,000
uh,

8405
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:11,000
everyone's able to do that stuff,

8406
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:12,000
um,

8407
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,000
while having the more advanced stuff be kind of a little bit later.

8408
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:16,000
We certainly had a goal at one point where I was like,

8409
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:17,000
we're talking with Rishi and I'm like,

8410
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:18,000
if,

8411
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:21,000
if it's every single time we're doing alpha wipes or getting the stuff to play,

8412
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:22,000
I am like,

8413
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:27,000
if I am not seeing and hearing about people using exalts during act one,

8414
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:28,000
then we have failed.

8415
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:29,000
And we need to drop more of them.

8416
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:31,000
And so we ended up like,

8417
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:31,000
I would say honestly,

8418
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:35,000
in the last month we have like over like eight to 10 times the amount of

8419
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:36,000
currency dropping,

8420
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:37,000
you know,

8421
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:38,000
and you know,

8422
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:39,000
there's the cool things about it as well,

8423
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:43,000
which are the subtle things like a boss is way more likely to drop the

8424
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:44,000
higher tier currencies and stuff.

8425
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:44,000
Cause again,

8426
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:46,000
rarity affects that as well now.

8427
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:50,000
So you're like way more incentivized to go and kill bosses to get them.

8428
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:50,000
And there's,

8429
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:52,000
there's heaps of awesome stuff around there,

8430
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:54,000
but we're actually now finding people are exalting gear,

8431
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:55,000
um,

8432
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:56,000
during the campaign,

8433
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:59,000
throwing it on weapons and building weapons from scratch.

8434
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
You find a very good transmute,

8435
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:02,000
org,

8436
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:02,000
regal,

8437
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:03,000
exalt,

8438
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:03,000
exalt,

8439
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:04,000
you know,

8440
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,000
that process is like transmute,

8441
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:06,000
um,

8442
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:07,000
org,

8443
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:07,000
regal,

8444
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
exalt is like a thing that you're doing often.

8445
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:10,000
Yeah.

8446
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:10,000
And like,

8447
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:11,000
enjoy,

8448
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:11,000
and you know,

8449
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:13,000
like when you find good bases and you do stuff with that.

8450
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:14,000
I can speak to that experience.

8451
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,000
So I've played probably six ish hours,

8452
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:17,000
most of the way through act two on my mercenary.

8453
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
And I've found maybe six or seven exalts.

8454
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:23,000
I took a ring from like a one blue stat ring that had a nice role,

8455
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:24,000
maybe a nice life role or something,

8456
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,000
and crafted it up to six property rare.

8457
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:31,000
And I crafted a crossbow that I found with good sockets that had a good damage

8458
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:32,000
role in it.

8459
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:35,000
And I took that to six properties with multiple damage mods.

8460
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:35,000
And I'm like,

8461
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:37,000
each time that power is going up.

8462
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:39,000
And I was,

8463
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:39,000
I was,

8464
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:40,000
I was doing that.

8465
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:40,000
It feels good.

8466
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:42,000
I felt like the bottleneck was regals,

8467
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:44,000
which was actually kind of interesting because I don't know if that's intentional,

8468
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:45,000
just luck,

8469
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:50,000
because I did really have to think about which blue items were good enough to take to a rare.

8470
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:50,000
Yep.

8471
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:52,000
So that I could then put my exalts on them.

8472
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000
So you get more of those by disenchanting rares.

8473
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:54,000
Yeah,

8474
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:55,000
they are farmable.

8475
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:56,000
So they are farmable,

8476
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:57,000
which is,

8477
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:57,000
um,

8478
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
completely intentional.

8479
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:00,000
We want to make sure that like,

8480
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:01,000
if you don't have enough of those,

8481
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:01,000
like,

8482
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:02,000
so you get,

8483
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:03,000
so generally speaking,

8484
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:03,000
it's like,

8485
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:04,000
you're going to want to keep,

8486
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:04,000
uh,

8487
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:04,000
like,

8488
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
I feel like once you get like more than like five or six transmutes,

8489
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:09,000
then you stop disenchanting blues and start selling them instead.

8490
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
And the same thing can be true also for,

8491
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:11,000
um,

8492
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:12,000
for regals where it's like,

8493
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:12,000
okay,

8494
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:14,000
once you've got more than a certain amount,

8495
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:14,000
then you're like,

8496
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:14,000
okay,

8497
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:17,000
I can stop having to disenchant this stuff and kind of switch over.

8498
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:18,000
But the nice thing is,

8499
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:19,000
is like when you don't have enough,

8500
03:17:19,000 --> 03:17:20,000
there is a way to get them,

8501
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:20,000
um,

8502
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:21,000
which I think is really important.

8503
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000
And the same is true with the socket currency as well,

8504
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:23,000
where it's like,

8505
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:24,000
you know,

8506
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:24,000
when you don't have enough,

8507
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:25,000
if you can start salvaging,

8508
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:29,000
I know you were telling me you were buying stuff from the vendor with sockets in order to salvage it.

8509
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:29,000
I surprised them with my,

8510
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:29,000
uh,

8511
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:30,000
yeah,

8512
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:30,000
yeah.

8513
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:31,000
With my methods.

8514
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:31,000
Uh,

8515
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:32,000
yeah,

8516
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:32,000
yeah.

8517
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:33,000
So,

8518
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:34,000
uh,

8519
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:34,000
that stuff,

8520
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:34,000
um,

8521
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:35,000
you know,

8522
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:36,000
it's just really nice to have the,

8523
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,000
for people to have the ability to,

8524
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:38,000
um,

8525
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:39,000
uh,

8526
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:39,000
you know,

8527
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:39,000
to,

8528
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:39,000
to,

8529
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:40,000
to,

8530
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:41,000
to get that stuff when they need it.

8531
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:47,000
And so it's nice that like all that really basic stuff of just like getting items to better tiers and is now way easier to get.

8532
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:47,000
And that,

8533
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:49,000
that solved a problem that we had,

8534
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:49,000
um,

8535
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:53,000
through quite a lot of the betas where people were saying they didn't feel like they had enough control.

8536
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:57,000
Like they didn't feel like they had a way to advance their character when they needed to,

8537
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:58,000
um,

8538
03:17:58,000 --> 03:17:59,000
to be able to solve specific problems.

8539
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:01,000
And I think the socket thing really has helped a lot with that now,

8540
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:04,000
because now we've got a way finally to be like,

8541
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:04,000
okay,

8542
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:05,000
if I need a bunch of fire resist,

8543
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:06,000
there is a way to get that.

8544
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:07,000
And I've got the tools to do it.

8545
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,000
And I've got items I can use to do this stuff.

8546
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:09,000
So,

8547
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:10,000
um,

8548
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:10,000
that,

8549
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:11,000
um,

8550
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:12,000
has helped a huge amount,

8551
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:13,000
I think of,

8552
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:13,000
um,

8553
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:13,000
solving those like,

8554
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:14,000
uh,

8555
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:14,000
you know,

8556
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:14,000
you know,

8557
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:16,000
issues that come up with your character.

8558
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:19,000
And this is to confirm how you've solved bench crafting.

8559
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:20,000
Exactly.

8560
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:22,000
So we went through so many iterations of bench,

8561
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:23,000
uh,

8562
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:23,000
stuff.

8563
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:24,000
It was like a huge thing.

8564
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:26,000
We implemented tons of UI.

8565
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:27,000
Like there was tons of wasted time there,

8566
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:27,000
uh,

8567
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:28,000
implementing crafting things.

8568
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:31,000
The problem that we had was that the systems that we were making,

8569
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:34,000
it's like we could balance them in the ways the players were happy with.

8570
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:35,000
And,

8571
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:35,000
um,

8572
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:39,000
then the designers were very unhappy or we could balance them the way the designers were happy with and the players were unhappy.

8573
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:40,000
And it's like,

8574
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:43,000
when you've got a system where like you're fighting the players for what,

8575
03:18:43,000 --> 03:18:44,000
how the balance should be,

8576
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:46,000
but you can tell that means you have a system that is bad.

8577
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:47,000
Um,

8578
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:48,000
but I think we were very like,

8579
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:53,000
like I myself honestly was too slow to recognize the fact that a complete overhaul was needed.

8580
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:53,000
Um,

8581
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:54,000
and,

8582
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:54,000
um,

8583
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:55,000
then at some point we actually,

8584
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:57,000
the socket stuff originally came from,

8585
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:58,000
um,

8586
03:18:58,000 --> 03:18:58,000
the Valor,

8587
03:18:58,000 --> 03:18:59,000
like it was designed there.

8588
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:00,000
Yeah.

8589
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:01,000
And then at some point,

8590
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:02,000
I don't know who came up with it.

8591
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:02,000
I think it might've just been you,

8592
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:03,000
um,

8593
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:03,000
who said like,

8594
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,000
why don't we just put Rishi thought of that?

8595
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:06,000
Okay.

8596
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:06,000
Yeah.

8597
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:07,000
So Rishi thought of the idea of like,

8598
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:07,000
Hey,

8599
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:08,000
what if we just put sockets,

8600
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:09,000
um,

8601
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:09,000
you know,

8602
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:10,000
in,

8603
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:10,000
uh,

8604
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:11,000
in early game,

8605
03:19:11,000 --> 03:19:12,000
what if you got them in act one?

8606
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:12,000
What if you had rooms,

8607
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:13,000
uh,

8608
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:14,000
that would let you,

8609
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:14,000
um,

8610
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:15,000
get the,

8611
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:15,000
uh,

8612
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:16,000
the,

8613
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:16,000
the,

8614
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:16,000
the,

8615
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:16,000
you know,

8616
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:16,000
the,

8617
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:19,000
the baseball as the way of solving the remedial crafting problem.

8618
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:19,000
And so then suddenly,

8619
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:20,000
as soon as we do that,

8620
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:20,000
it's like,

8621
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:21,000
Oh,

8622
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:22,000
like I'm happy,

8623
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:23,000
uh,

8624
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:23,000
you know,

8625
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:24,000
players are happy,

8626
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:24,000
everyone's happy.

8627
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:25,000
Um,

8628
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:25,000
so,

8629
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:26,000
uh,

8630
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:27,000
that means we have a good system that,

8631
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:27,000
uh,

8632
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:28,000
is working and,

8633
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:28,000
you know,

8634
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:29,000
and gets,

8635
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:30,000
gets those good feelings.

8636
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:30,000
So,

8637
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:30,000
um,

8638
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:30,000
that,

8639
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:31,000
that I think was a real win.

8640
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:32,000
Um,

8641
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:33,000
and,

8642
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:33,000
uh,

8643
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:33,000
you know,

8644
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:33,000
yeah,

8645
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:34,000
I'm,

8646
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:34,000
I,

8647
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:35,000
I love how that system is feeling.

8648
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:36,000
Yeah.

8649
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:39,000
So the bench was achieving two things kind of in its way,

8650
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:40,000
um,

8651
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:40,000
which was,

8652
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:41,000
uh,

8653
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
maybe even three gear customization for one,

8654
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:46,000
like you take an item and you can do something more to it firstly,

8655
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:48,000
and then you've got the problem fixing of like,

8656
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:49,000
Oh,

8657
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:50,000
I need a bit more fire resistance.

8658
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:50,000
Yes,

8659
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:50,000
yes,

8660
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:50,000
yes.

8661
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:52,000
And then the third thing was like the meta crafts.

8662
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:52,000
Um,

8663
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:52,000
yeah,

8664
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:53,000
yeah.

8665
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:54,000
So you've handled those each in different ways.

8666
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:55,000
Exactly.

8667
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:56,000
You've got the runes,

8668
03:19:56,000 --> 03:19:57,000
which do the first two things,

8669
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:59,000
the customization and the problem fixing.

8670
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:00,000
So early on,

8671
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:02,000
but I think the customization is even,

8672
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:02,000
it's the,

8673
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:03,000
it's the,

8674
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:03,000
uh,

8675
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:03,000
um,

8676
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:04,000
sorry,

8677
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:04,000
what do you call them?

8678
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:05,000
The soul cause,

8679
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:07,000
like the runes are more about the kind of like,

8680
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:08,000
I need to fix resistances.

8681
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:10,000
Whereas the soul cause are more about like,

8682
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:12,000
I want to customize my items in different ways than what I would,

8683
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:12,000
um,

8684
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:14,000
otherwise normally be able to do.

8685
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:14,000
Um,

8686
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:17,000
and then of course you've got the omens to solve the meta crafting problem.

8687
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:18,000
So we effectively moved all that stuff around.

8688
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:19,000
And essences of course,

8689
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:19,000
yes,

8690
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:19,000
of course.

8691
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:20,000
Um,

8692
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:20,000
so,

8693
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:20,000
um,

8694
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:21,000
yeah,

8695
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:23,000
essence is what they allow you to do is get two deterministic mods.

8696
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:24,000
Yeah.

8697
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:24,000
Um,

8698
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:24,000
so,

8699
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:26,000
cause you can upgrade to a blue and the,

8700
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:27,000
but you can also upgrade from blue to,

8701
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:28,000
um,

8702
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:28,000
to,

8703
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:28,000
to,

8704
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:29,000
to,

8705
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:29,000
to,

8706
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:29,000
to rare,

8707
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:30,000
um,

8708
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:30,000
with an essence as well.

8709
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:32,000
So that lets you kind of get some of that stuff.

8710
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:33,000
And then plus some of the omen things you can,

8711
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:34,000
yeah,

8712
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:35,000
there's stuff you can do there.

8713
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:36,000
Um,

8714
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:36,000
that,

8715
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:37,000
uh,

8716
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:38,000
is I think going to be pretty interesting.

8717
03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:40,000
And that's just at the start of release.

8718
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:40,000
Yeah.

8719
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:42,000
Because obviously there's going to be more,

8720
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:42,000
of course,

8721
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,000
as we add more things,

8722
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:44,000
you know?

8723
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:44,000
So,

8724
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:44,000
uh,

8725
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:45,000
yeah.

8726
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:45,000
Um,

8727
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:47,000
so I was like,

8728
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:48,000
I was worried that,

8729
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:48,000
you know,

8730
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:52,000
some of the changes you're making might move us away from some of the like deep impactful

8731
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:53,000
crafting that we have,

8732
03:20:53,000 --> 03:21:00,000
but it sounds like you are still allowing like powerful meta crafting and the ability to make like a really good item.

8733
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:01,000
For sure.

8734
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:06,000
But you're also making sure that like the physical item itself that you find matters more.

8735
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:06,000
Absolutely.

8736
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:07,000
Mm-hmm.

8737
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:08,000
And I mean,

8738
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:08,000
like the,

8739
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:09,000
the more subtle,

8740
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:10,000
that's what it's all about,

8741
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:10,000
right?

8742
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:10,000
There's,

8743
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:11,000
there's so much more going on.

8744
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:12,000
I think just like,

8745
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:14,000
just like clever things we've done with the,

8746
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:14,000
um,

8747
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:15,000
with the item system as well.

8748
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:19,000
Like one of the things I love that we did is we've made it so that,

8749
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:19,000
um,

8750
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:22,000
so we've got blue and a yellow chests you can find now,

8751
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:23,000
and we've changed the,

8752
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:23,000
uh,

8753
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:26,000
world generation so that if a dead end is generated,

8754
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:27,000
um,

8755
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:29,000
the chance that you get a rare chest there is,

8756
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:29,000
is,

8757
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:29,000
is,

8758
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:30,000
is way higher.

8759
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:31,000
So effectively,

8760
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:32,000
if a rare chest will spawn in the area,

8761
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:34,000
then it will choose dead ends first to go there.

8762
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:35,000
You feel better about it.

8763
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:35,000
Yeah.

8764
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:37,000
So like that means that we effectively mean that like,

8765
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:39,000
like it makes the world feel like,

8766
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:39,000
you know,

8767
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:40,000
as far as item drops go,

8768
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:40,000
they're like,

8769
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:41,000
oh,

8770
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:41,000
like,

8771
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:42,000
it feels intentional,

8772
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:42,000
right?

8773
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:43,000
Like,

8774
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:43,000
oh,

8775
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:44,000
I went down this into this dead end room,

8776
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:45,000
but look,

8777
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:46,000
there was a rare chest there.

8778
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:46,000
So I feel happy about it.

8779
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:47,000
You know,

8780
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:47,000
like that kind of thing is,

8781
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:48,000
is,

8782
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:48,000
is,

8783
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:49,000
is really cool.

8784
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:49,000
Um,

8785
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:50,000
so,

8786
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:50,000
uh,

8787
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:51,000
there's things like that,

8788
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:52,000
but there's also the way that,

8789
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:52,000
um,

8790
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:52,000
yeah,

8791
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:54,000
so we've alluded to it a few times,

8792
03:21:54,000 --> 03:21:55,000
but the,

8793
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:56,000
the way that rarity now works,

8794
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:56,000
um,

8795
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:59,000
where the mods get better as rarity increases.

8796
03:21:59,000 --> 03:21:59,000
And,

8797
03:21:59,000 --> 03:21:59,000
um,

8798
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:00,000
also things like the,

8799
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:01,000
um,

8800
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:02,000
you get better currency rather than just,

8801
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:03,000
yeah,

8802
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:05,000
it means we don't have to have like the spam of items.

8803
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:06,000
That's like crazy.

8804
03:22:06,000 --> 03:22:07,000
Like you actually feel like,

8805
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:08,000
um,

8806
03:22:08,000 --> 03:22:09,000
the,

8807
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:09,000
uh,

8808
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:09,000
the,

8809
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:09,000
the,

8810
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:10,000
the,

8811
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:10,000
the,

8812
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:10,000
the,

8813
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:10,000
the,

8814
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:10,000
the,

8815
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:10,000
the,

8816
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:11,000
you kill a boss and it drops good shit,

8817
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:13,000
um,

8818
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:14,000
as opposed to just lots of shit.

8819
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:14,000
Um,

8820
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:15,000
so,

8821
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:15,000
uh,

8822
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:15,000
you know,

8823
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:15,000
that,

8824
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:16,000
that,

8825
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:16,000
that,

8826
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:16,000
that's the,

8827
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:17,000
that's,

8828
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:17,000
that's,

8829
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:17,000
that's,

8830
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:17,000
that's,

8831
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:18,000
I'm a big fan of how this feels.

8832
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:19,000
I think it's a lot better.

8833
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:19,000
Um,

8834
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:20,000
but it does mean though,

8835
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:20,000
of course,

8836
03:22:21,000 --> 03:22:23,000
if you're a PeeWee one player and you see a boss kill,

8837
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:24,000
like the number of,

8838
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:25,000
like the,

8839
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:26,000
the expectation of like,

8840
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:34,000
Because a PvE 1 player sees, like, looks at the amount of spam on the screen to some level as the way of, like, knowing how good the drops were.

8841
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:35,000
Now, of course, you've got item filters and everything.

8842
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:36,000
We have quantity brain rot.

8843
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:37,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

8844
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:39,000
Exactly.

8845
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:40,000
That is a good way of putting it.

8846
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:44,000
So, yeah, it really is more about, like, are the items actually good?

8847
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:47,000
Like, ideally, you kill a boss and you pick every item it drops up.

8848
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:50,000
You know, like, that to me is a win.

8849
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:53,000
And I think we're basically getting it at that point.

8850
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:54,000
Yeah.

8851
03:22:54,000 --> 03:23:05,000
And I quite like how the exploration systems in that as well, with the chests, dead ends and things like that, acts as a player leveler in some ways.

8852
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:05,000
Yes.

8853
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:06,000
Where, like, a player is struggling.

8854
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:07,000
Yep.

8855
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:08,000
The more you explore, the more stuff you'll find.

8856
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:11,000
And that's true as well for the optional encounters around the place as well.

8857
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:14,000
If you're struggling, go fight some optional content.

8858
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:20,000
There will be stuff there that can drop and, you know, and you will definitely find more things.

8859
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,000
Lots of guaranteed rare items here and there.

8860
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:23,000
Exactly.

8861
03:23:23,000 --> 03:23:29,000
Like, this little boss here will drop a caster, a rare caster item and, like, heaps of stuff.

8862
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:39,000
And the funny thing about that is that stuff, like, came about a little bit from the fact that we actually had a problem where people were just face tanking bosses and dying over and over again.

8863
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:39,000
Yeah.

8864
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:44,000
And they keep on respawning and they would never be like, oh, I'm going to go away and actually find some other stuff.

8865
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:52,000
And so I was thinking for a long time about, like, well, why is it that in other games that people don't do that?

8866
03:23:52,000 --> 03:23:57,000
Like, if I'm playing Elden Ring and I die to a boss, like, you know, 10 times, I'm not just going to, like, just continue doing that.

8867
03:23:57,000 --> 03:23:59,000
I'm going to be like, oh, maybe I'll go do something else for a while.

8868
03:23:59,000 --> 03:24:04,000
So we realized that the map, like, the idea of just there's lots of stuff to find, like, is actually a really important part of that.

8869
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:16,000
So in PeeWee 2 now, one of the recent things, and it's taken a lot of work from people to get this working, but now all of that, you can see all the sort of weird side encounters that have specific drops on the map.

8870
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:20,000
And that means that, you know, if you're having trouble with the boss, you're like, oh, you know what, I'm just going to go do some other stuff.

8871
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:26,000
And then you'll come back and you will be powerful enough to kill the boss much more easily because you do absolutely find the rewarding things.

8872
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:28,000
Yeah, there's a little chest on there or a little campsite.

8873
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:29,000
Yeah, yeah.

8874
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:32,000
There's lots of little hard-coded drops from specific bosses.

8875
03:24:32,000 --> 03:24:35,000
The hard-coded drops, they only drop one time, so you can't just farm them endlessly.

8876
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:40,000
But effectively, if you go do all that side content and you check it all off, you'll get some very rewarding stuff.

8877
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:42,000
Yeah, you've got some pretty clever systems there.

8878
03:24:42,000 --> 03:24:48,000
And I definitely noted that I was using the map thing a lot to be like, oh, well, to be completionist about it a bit.

8879
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:53,000
But also, yeah, just being aware of, like, oh, cool, there's some good stuff in this zone that I can come and find.

8880
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:58,000
And I think we figured out that, like, some of that stuff reveals after you, like, find the waypoint in a zone, for example.

8881
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:59,000
I think that's how it works, is that?

8882
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:01,000
Yeah, it's either, there's a few, so it's like,

8883
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:06,000
either because an NPC told you about an area, in which case it just happens to be revealed,

8884
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:09,000
or at the very least, yes, when you get there.

8885
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:12,000
Generally, it's just when you get there, you see everything.

8886
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:15,000
But there's a few different conditions that will reveal everything.

8887
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:17,000
It kind of depends.

8888
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:21,000
Like, a lot of people just click through the dialogue, so they'll never know the NPC told them, but they maybe did.

8889
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:25,000
I was checking my map kind of like when I went into a zone, and then maybe afterwards to see if there was anything interesting.

8890
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:31,000
But, like, you never get to an area and don't see some, unless they are, like, very obviously hidden intentional secrets.

8891
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:32,000
Yeah.

8892
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:33,000
There's nearly something everywhere.

8893
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:34,000
They might be there, they might not.

8894
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:36,000
Yes, I found half of your key for your secret quest.

8895
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:38,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, don't worry about that.

8896
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:48,000
So, pivoting into economy and trading, the exchange from Path of Exile's one experiment recently,

8897
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:53,000
we got a chance to actually try that live in the field, and it seems from the player's perspective it was a smash hit.

8898
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:54,000
Definitely for us as well.

8899
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:55,000
Yeah, okay.

8900
03:25:55,000 --> 03:25:56,000
Solved a lot.

8901
03:25:56,000 --> 03:25:56,000
Great.

8902
03:25:56,000 --> 03:25:58,000
We were 100% on board with that.

8903
03:25:59,000 --> 03:25:59,000
It's very good.

8904
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:02,000
It was the least stressful league I ever played.

8905
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:03,000
Same.

8906
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:09,000
What normally caused almost all the anger and friction for me was, especially bulk trading.

8907
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:09,000
It was horrible.

8908
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:13,000
And I was just like, oh, this is like a dream come true.

8909
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:18,000
Myself and so many other players, I feel like we're more engaged in endgame, we were able to do the thing we wanted to do more,

8910
03:26:18,000 --> 03:26:21,000
and we're just less aggravated on a moment-to-moment basis.

8911
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:22,000
That's good.

8912
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:28,000
So, do you take that then as a big positive for it going into Path of Exile 2?

8913
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:28,000
100%.

8914
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:32,000
And how do you feel like it adapts to the game being quite different in the end?

8915
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:33,000
Because they are pretty different games.

8916
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:34,000
Like, the economy works a bit differently.

8917
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:37,000
I mean, honestly, I think it will just work.

8918
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:41,000
I mean, look, we have no idea what the trade values will settle on and how that will end up.

8919
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:41,000
Yeah.

8920
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:43,000
Is it going to be chaos?

8921
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:44,000
Is it going to be exalt?

8922
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:44,000
Yeah.

8923
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:52,000
But ultimately, I think that the trades, effectively, settlers was a test of what the economy will be like in POE 2,

8924
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:54,000
and to some extent, because of the way that we did the gold and everything.

8925
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:55,000
Yeah.

8926
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:57,000
So, I'm pretty confident that that's going to be okay.

8927
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:58,000
But obviously, you never know, right?

8928
03:26:58,000 --> 03:27:01,000
Like, when lots of people hit the economy, what can happen?

8929
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:05,000
Hopefully, we don't cause horrible hyperinflation or have some horrible issue like that.

8930
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:10,000
But I guess, you know, partly this is what an early access is to find out, right?

8931
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:11,000
Like, whether there's any issues like that.

8932
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:13,000
Was there any...

8933
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:13,000
Economy testing.

8934
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:17,000
Was there any surprises with that or with gold in terms of how things panned out?

8935
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:18,000
Thankfully, not, honestly.

8936
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:23,000
Like, we were worried, but thankfully, none of the, like, horrible situations came to pass with that.

8937
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,000
And it ended up working just fine.

8938
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:29,000
So, yeah, like, it went great.

8939
03:27:29,000 --> 03:27:33,000
Who'd have thought 10 years later, we'd be back here saying, you know what?

8940
03:27:33,000 --> 03:27:34,000
Gold was a good idea.

8941
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:35,000
We just had to do it right.

8942
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:35,000
Exactly, exactly.

8943
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:39,000
Because I remember 10 years ago, we were like, this game's brilliant.

8944
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:40,000
It has no gold.

8945
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:40,000
Stupid gold.

8946
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:47,000
But the funny thing is, I don't think we would have arrived at the way gold is now if we had had it in the first place.

8947
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:47,000
Yeah.

8948
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:50,000
Like, the non-tradability of using it as a sort of marker for how much play you've done.

8949
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:54,000
I don't think that we would have ever had that way if we hadn't arrived from here.

8950
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:57,000
So, I think that that path dependency kind of did matter.

8951
03:27:58,000 --> 03:27:59,000
So, yeah.

8952
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:01,000
The paths we weave.

8953
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:16,000
So, how likely then, based on just how successful it is, are you to want to expand the, like, exchanges capabilities to, like, other things, like maps or waystones or even gear?

8954
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:20,000
Well, I mean, look, I'm interested in this, but I don't think it's necessary right now.

8955
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:24,000
So, in early access, at least, we're not going to launch with any expanded stuff in that way.

8956
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:27,000
But I guess I do want to sort of see how it works.

8957
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:30,000
And I'm interested in potentially trying something like that in the future.

8958
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:34,000
I just don't, like, the currency exchange was, like, 90% of the problem.

8959
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:34,000
Yeah.

8960
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:39,000
And so, fixing that, like, fixed a lot of the, you know, like, it seemed like there would be, we would need to do more initially.

8961
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:41,000
And then maybe now it's seeming like maybe we don't.

8962
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:43,000
But I still want to experiment with it potentially.

8963
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:45,000
So, you know, I'm interested to see how it goes.

8964
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:48,000
But, yeah, the currency exchange definitely helped a vast amount of it.

8965
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:49,000
Those were the annoying drains most of the time.

8966
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:50,000
They were, for sure.

8967
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:50,000
They were.

8968
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:50,000
Yeah.

8969
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:50,000
Yeah.

8970
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:51,000
Definitely.

8971
03:28:52,000 --> 03:28:53,000
Great.

8972
03:28:54,000 --> 03:29:01,000
So, we've had some, well, so this is a tricky question to answer, especially if we could just scroll down.

8973
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:03,000
There we go.

8974
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:03,000
Yeah.

8975
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:10,000
So, what are you aiming for in terms of Path of Exile 2 is kind of, like, personal player economy and progression.

8976
03:29:11,000 --> 03:29:21,000
So, how much resources you're acquiring, how you're using them, but also how much are you getting from trade versus from yourself?

8977
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:28,000
I mean, this is a tricky question, but, I mean, I think that really the feeling of, like, being able to trade is super important.

8978
03:29:28,000 --> 03:29:30,000
So, being able to get that stuff, I think, is good.

8979
03:29:30,000 --> 03:29:31,000
Like, now, not everyone wants to do that.

8980
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:34,000
You need to be able to progress through the game well without having to do much trade.

8981
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:41,000
But I do think that, like, you know, look, it's definitely going to be the case that if you're playing in a trade league, you're going to have the ability to…

8982
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:41,000
It accelerates.

8983
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,000
It accelerates you very significantly.

8984
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:45,000
And that's the case, and it will continue to be the case.

8985
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:45,000
Yeah.

8986
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:47,000
Like, we are a game that embraces trade.

8987
03:29:47,000 --> 03:29:52,000
Yeah, well, I think the DNA of Path of Exile 1 is very much that, like, it is a game about economy and trade.

8988
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:53,000
Yeah, 100%.

8989
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:56,000
And for some people, getting rich is their main motivator.

8990
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:57,000
100%.

8991
03:29:57,000 --> 03:29:57,000
So, effectively, yeah.

8992
03:29:57,000 --> 03:29:59,000
So, I mean, that will absolutely be a factor.

8993
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:03,000
And, look, like, I think that the feeling of that will probably end up feeling quite similar to PvE 1 in that regard.

8994
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:04,000
Yeah.

8995
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:06,000
And I think that's what, you know, that's the type of game we're making.

8996
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:07,000
Yeah.

8997
03:30:07,000 --> 03:30:07,000
Do you think it's…

8998
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:12,000
That said, though, do you think it is, in some ways, better for a solo self-found sort of experience?

8999
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:20,000
I mean, I simply do, simply because, again, as we talked about, we're dropping a lot more currency that we expect you to use on here.

9000
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:21,000
Exactly.

9001
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:24,000
As opposed to save to endgame for one.

9002
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:32,000
And then, by endgame, like, we don't have Kerak mods costing, you know, that kind of stuff that all costs chaos.

9003
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:35,000
And you don't have, like, the meta mods costing divines and all that, right?

9004
03:30:35,000 --> 03:30:36,000
They're all different items.

9005
03:30:37,000 --> 03:30:38,000
You're like, I want meta mod crafting.

9006
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:39,000
There's a ritual.

9007
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:39,000
I'm going to get it.

9008
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:40,000
You know where to get them as well.

9009
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:40,000
Right?

9010
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:51,000
So you're not just, like, having to, I'm blocked behind this thing because I need so many divines and I can't get that because I'm solo self-found and farming divines is not exactly, you know, beyond trivial.

9011
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:58,000
So, you know, there's a number of ways there where I'd say it is, honestly, a much better solo self-found experience.

9012
03:30:58,000 --> 03:31:02,000
But, you know, each to their own, that to be seen and, you know.

9013
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:07,000
And there'll be a separate solo self-found mode, presumably, even potentially beta launch or in the future?

9014
03:31:07,000 --> 03:31:10,000
It is our intention to have hardcore and solo self-found.

9015
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:10,000
I'll have both of them.

9016
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:10,000
Right.

9017
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:11,000
Cool.

9018
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:11,000
Yeah.

9019
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:15,000
I wouldn't play hardcore for your first round, honestly, because you're likely to die.

9020
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:17,000
Like, once you learn the boss mechanics, it should be fine.

9021
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:20,000
But first time, you know, it's going to be tricky.

9022
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:23,000
Couch co-op hardcore and you get to see your friend die right next to you.

9023
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:24,000
That's the true dream.

9024
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:27,000
Actually, hang on.

9025
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:27,000
Wait.

9026
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:30,000
In couch co-op hardcore, do we still lock the camera so you can't walk away from your friend?

9027
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:31,000
Ah, no.

9028
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:33,000
We put you back to solo.

9029
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:33,000
You put you back to solo?

9030
03:31:33,000 --> 03:31:34,000
Okay, great.

9031
03:31:34,000 --> 03:31:35,000
That's good to know.

9032
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:36,000
It's like the other.

9033
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:39,000
You have to have a mourning period of about 30 seconds.

9034
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:40,000
Right, right, right.

9035
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:42,000
But you're just like, all right, you can go home now.

9036
03:31:42,000 --> 03:31:43,000
We're like, yeah, go.

9037
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:43,000
Yeah.

9038
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:44,000
See ya.

9039
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:45,000
What do you do?

9040
03:31:46,000 --> 03:31:47,000
Yeah.

9041
03:31:47,000 --> 03:31:49,000
That is a devastating moment.

9042
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:55,000
So I did lose my place there.

9043
03:31:57,000 --> 03:31:57,000
Yeah.

9044
03:31:57,000 --> 03:31:59,000
I think we mentioned the co-op support and everything.

9045
03:31:59,000 --> 03:32:02,000
And we'll scroll down and take some of the additional questions here.

9046
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:02,000
Excellent.

9047
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:02,000
Thanks.

9048
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:11,000
So will there be a penalty for individual party member dying when grouping up for bosses

9049
03:32:11,000 --> 03:32:12,000
on that note then?

9050
03:32:13,000 --> 03:32:16,000
It seems weird that the boss straight up resets when playing solo, but when playing in a group

9051
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:17,000
nothing happens if a party member dies.

9052
03:32:17,000 --> 03:32:18,000
Tell us about the rules.

9053
03:32:18,000 --> 03:32:19,000
Yeah.

9054
03:32:19,000 --> 03:32:19,000
How else do we have?

9055
03:32:19,000 --> 03:32:20,000
Because I know you've changed them recently.

9056
03:32:21,000 --> 03:32:21,000
Yeah.

9057
03:32:21,000 --> 03:32:24,000
So, well, bosses are obviously harder for having more people.

9058
03:32:25,000 --> 03:32:25,000
Yep.

9059
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:27,000
Less crowd controls.

9060
03:32:28,000 --> 03:32:31,000
Things like, obviously, more life.

9061
03:32:31,000 --> 03:32:32,000
And I'm not just saying double life.

9062
03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:33,000
More than double life, right?

9063
03:32:33,000 --> 03:32:37,000
It does get more than twice as hard or more than in players as hard.

9064
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:43,000
So, yes, you could argue, okay, we have reviving as an advantage.

9065
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:44,000
Well, yes, it does.

9066
03:32:44,000 --> 03:32:45,000
It does take time to revive.

9067
03:32:46,000 --> 03:32:49,000
And if your friend dies early and you're unable to revive them because you're constantly being

9068
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:53,000
interrupted, well, you're not having a fun time.

9069
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:54,000
You get a big stun or something.

9070
03:32:54,000 --> 03:32:59,000
Another change that we made recently is, of course, for each revive between each set of

9071
03:32:59,000 --> 03:32:59,000
checkpoints.

9072
03:32:59,000 --> 03:33:03,000
Every time you have to revive them, the revive takes longer subsequent times.

9073
03:33:03,000 --> 03:33:08,000
So, that's important because it just means that you can't revive spam anymore because

9074
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:09,000
it's going to take longer and longer each time.

9075
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:11,000
But then when you go to a checkpoint, that resets.

9076
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:13,000
So, you're back to normal.

9077
03:33:13,000 --> 03:33:15,000
Now, in endgame maps, you cannot revive each other.

9078
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:17,000
Death is a consequence.

9079
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:17,000
Yeah.

9080
03:33:19,000 --> 03:33:21,000
I was going to ask, actually, about endgame maps.

9081
03:33:22,000 --> 03:33:23,000
What is the rule for dying in endgame maps?

9082
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:25,000
Is it one portal deal now, not six portals?

9083
03:33:25,000 --> 03:33:27,000
Well, you still have six portals, so you can have your party members.

9084
03:33:27,000 --> 03:33:31,000
And you can leave and come back as long as you don't die.

9085
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:32,000
So, you can take items out.

9086
03:33:32,000 --> 03:33:34,000
But a death will end that map for you.

9087
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:35,000
Yeah.

9088
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:40,000
And to remind people, if you log out or the server crashes or something like that, that's

9089
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:41,000
going to happen.

9090
03:33:41,000 --> 03:33:43,000
Then the game pauses.

9091
03:33:44,000 --> 03:33:47,000
So, when you boot the game back up and log back in, you'll be still in your map, right?

9092
03:33:47,000 --> 03:33:53,000
And also, we also now have it so that if you just old F4 the game at a random time, you'll

9093
03:33:53,000 --> 03:33:59,000
actually, even if you come back the next day, because, for example, you might have rage quit,

9094
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:03,000
you will appear back at the checkpoint you were at.

9095
03:34:03,000 --> 03:34:07,000
So, if you are fighting a boss, you die a bunch of times, you're like, ah, crap, old F4, you

9096
03:34:07,000 --> 03:34:09,000
come back, you're going to be right there at the boss checkpoint again.

9097
03:34:10,000 --> 03:34:13,000
That part is campaign specific, because there are no checkpoints in maps.

9098
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:13,000
Yeah, not maps.

9099
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:18,000
But for the campaign, though, and that, honestly, has helped a lot.

9100
03:34:18,000 --> 03:34:24,000
Like, there were so many, I think it really did cause new players to have problems in

9101
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:27,000
POV1, where they felt like they just lost track of where the hell they even were when

9102
03:34:27,000 --> 03:34:28,000
they came back after a session.

9103
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:31,000
If, like, they might have not got waypoints for certain times or things like that.

9104
03:34:31,000 --> 03:34:34,000
Like, you now can't have the situation where you log back in and you're like, oh, I'm

9105
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:37,000
like, I forgot, like, three waypoints in a row, and now I'm, like, freaking miles away

9106
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:37,000
from where I was.

9107
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:39,000
Which I think happen to do players fairly frequently.

9108
03:34:40,000 --> 03:34:43,000
I'm glad in a world where everyone's becoming a Souls-like that you guys didn't do the running

9109
03:34:43,000 --> 03:34:49,000
back to the boss segment of gameplay, and you just kind of jump back in and have another

9110
03:34:49,000 --> 03:34:49,000
crack.

9111
03:34:50,000 --> 03:34:51,000
I appreciate that.

9112
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:54,000
So, yeah, so effectively, like, that's nice to just have the save checkpoints to your

9113
03:34:54,000 --> 03:34:57,000
character, which I think is a nice one.

9114
03:34:58,000 --> 03:34:59,000
Were there any other mechanics around there?

9115
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:00,000
Reviving?

9116
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:02,000
Well, obviously in hardcore, you did, you did.

9117
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:04,000
That's the drill.

9118
03:35:04,000 --> 03:35:05,000
That's irrelevant at that point.

9119
03:35:05,000 --> 03:35:10,000
So, yeah, maps almost embraces a kind of semi-hardcore mentality there where there is actual cost.

9120
03:35:10,000 --> 03:35:16,000
Like, we went through so many iterations here where it's like, okay, like, the moment that

9121
03:35:16,000 --> 03:35:22,000
you have to spend something of economic value to do the attempt, hence a map, a map item,

9122
03:35:22,000 --> 03:35:26,000
and especially if it's got breaches and all this content that's coming from precursor tablets,

9123
03:35:27,000 --> 03:35:28,000
all of this stuff is worth stuff.

9124
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:32,000
So, you all of a sudden have heaps of stuff on the line, and then you don't want to be in

9125
03:35:32,000 --> 03:35:37,000
a position where you're like, nah, I need to bring in some people to do this because

9126
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:38,000
I'm not going to risk that value.

9127
03:35:39,000 --> 03:35:42,000
So, that's why we just were like, in maps, no reviving.

9128
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:46,000
It's just like, yeah, sure, you still can always bring in any context someone way more

9129
03:35:46,000 --> 03:35:47,000
powerful than you to carry things, right?

9130
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:49,000
That's the benefit of multiplayer.

9131
03:35:50,000 --> 03:35:54,000
But feeling like you have to do this thing because then they can just keep reviving you

9132
03:35:54,000 --> 03:35:56,000
so you can get all the rewards.

9133
03:35:56,000 --> 03:35:59,000
It's like, we're trying to get away from all of that, otherwise you get this weird thing

9134
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:02,000
where you're often always too scared to do the thing.

9135
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:09,000
Now, you're scared, but everyone's scared, and it's fine, and you don't feel like, you're

9136
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:12,000
like, okay, you have to go in with a sense of confidence to, like, I can definitely do

9137
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:13,000
this thing.

9138
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:16,000
And so, it's just a little bit less fear when it comes to all of a sudden doing that.

9139
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:20,000
That's much better in the context of the fact that you can pause the game if your cat's

9140
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:25,000
on fire or if the server crashes or something that you just paused and you can jump back in

9141
03:36:25,000 --> 03:36:25,000
as well.

9142
03:36:26,000 --> 03:36:28,000
You're failing because of your own faults.

9143
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:28,000
Yep.

9144
03:36:29,000 --> 03:36:32,000
Now, it's worth noting in multiplayer, we do have a thing, of course, with respawn at

9145
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:33,000
checkpoints as an option.

9146
03:36:34,000 --> 03:36:38,000
So, if a player dies and you don't want to, like, you don't want to die, you don't want

9147
03:36:38,000 --> 03:36:42,000
to finish the fight out, you can both choose to respawn at checkpoint, and then it will

9148
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:43,000
just create a new instance.

9149
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:45,000
You don't have to die to do it.

9150
03:36:46,000 --> 03:36:49,000
And you don't have to log out and do any shenanigans like that.

9151
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:53,000
You can just press escape, hit respawn at checkpoint, it'll ask other players to confirm,

9152
03:36:53,000 --> 03:36:55,000
and then it moves you all to the new area.

9153
03:36:55,000 --> 03:36:55,000
Cool.

9154
03:36:55,000 --> 03:36:56,000
Excellent.

9155
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:59,000
I didn't want to go super on it because we've definitely talked about it before, but

9156
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:01,000
click-to-move versus WSD, it's definitely been asked about a bit.

9157
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:04,000
So, there's been plenty of reports about WSD being amazing.

9158
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:07,000
Personally, I've been using it a ton and really enjoying it.

9159
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:12,000
I know you've said a lot of people around the office have, like, given it a try and adapted

9160
03:37:12,000 --> 03:37:17,000
to that, but it has raised the point for people that feel like they're still very much against

9161
03:37:17,000 --> 03:37:21,000
that for whatever reason, or maybe that they literally only have one hand and want to use

9162
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:22,000
click-to-move still.

9163
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:23,000
How does it stack up?

9164
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:25,000
How does click-to-move still stack up now?

9165
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:27,000
I think, honestly, it's fine.

9166
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:28,000
Like, it's not been a problem.

9167
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:33,000
There was a time where every time I'd go to sit down at a developer's computer, they'd be

9168
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:37,000
in WSD, and just because it's a little bit easier to move around again or whatever.

9169
03:37:37,000 --> 03:37:42,000
But lately, I'd say now it's back to almost every designer's computer I sit back down

9170
03:37:42,000 --> 03:37:44,000
at to go play, they're back in click-to-move.

9171
03:37:44,000 --> 03:37:44,000
Interesting.

9172
03:37:44,000 --> 03:37:45,000
Yep.

9173
03:37:45,000 --> 03:37:46,000
It's gone full tilt the other way.

9174
03:37:46,000 --> 03:37:47,000
Interesting.

9175
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:49,000
And I'm always like, ah, change it back.

9176
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:49,000
I wonder why that is.

9177
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:54,000
But even watching Octavian play on click-to-move.

9178
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:55,000
He's a click-to-move player, yeah.

9179
03:37:55,000 --> 03:37:56,000
He's 100% click-to-move.

9180
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:58,000
He is very proficient with that.

9181
03:37:59,000 --> 03:38:03,000
That'll be reassuring for, I think, some of the people that are worried about being forced

9182
03:38:03,000 --> 03:38:04,000
into WSD.

9183
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:07,000
Even though it is, obviously, playing so well by all accounts.

9184
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:10,000
That's very good then.

9185
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:11,000
Yeah.

9186
03:38:11,000 --> 03:38:14,000
And Octavian's often doing the demonstrations for your live things too.

9187
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:16,000
So you'll be able to see that even.

9188
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:19,000
I have to force them to play WSD sometimes because I'm like, oh, I think the Mercenary

9189
03:38:19,000 --> 03:38:21,000
looks so much better with WSD just visually.

9190
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:22,000
Yeah.

9191
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:23,000
So, you know, I'll tell them to.

9192
03:38:24,000 --> 03:38:25,000
It does feel very good on the Mercenary.

9193
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

9194
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:29,000
They're kind of like stalking through, especially with that kind of like preparational tactical

9195
03:38:29,000 --> 03:38:29,000
play style.

9196
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

9197
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:31,000
Yeah, that's good.

9198
03:38:31,000 --> 03:38:32,000
Loving it so far.

9199
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:35,000
We did already talk about the skin transfers.

9200
03:38:35,000 --> 03:38:38,000
Can we scroll down to any additional questions that we have?

9201
03:38:39,000 --> 03:38:41,000
I feel like, I don't even know how long we've been going for.

9202
03:38:41,000 --> 03:38:43,000
I mean, it's a while.

9203
03:38:43,000 --> 03:38:44,000
I'm feeling the physical fatigue creep in at this point.

9204
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:45,000
Yeah, exactly.

9205
03:38:45,000 --> 03:38:46,000
We've been going.

9206
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:47,000
We've been rolling.

9207
03:38:47,000 --> 03:38:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

9208
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:52,000
People asking if there's going to be anything like challenges or challenge rewards in the

9209
03:38:52,000 --> 03:38:54,000
early access.

9210
03:38:54,000 --> 03:38:55,000
Not at first, no.

9211
03:38:55,000 --> 03:38:56,000
We will do it later, though.

9212
03:38:56,000 --> 03:38:59,000
Did I ask about races, events, and private leagues?

9213
03:39:00,000 --> 03:39:03,000
I think not initially, but we will do it later for sure.

9214
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:03,000
Cool.

9215
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:07,000
I think the, I'm not sure what happened because I think the issue was that the private league

9216
03:39:07,000 --> 03:39:10,000
interface was like on the POE1 site and we had to do some work and something like

9217
03:39:10,000 --> 03:39:10,000
that.

9218
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:12,000
It wouldn't be far away, though.

9219
03:39:12,000 --> 03:39:13,000
It won't take us that long before we get to it.

9220
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:16,000
I can't exactly remember either, but yeah.

9221
03:39:16,000 --> 03:39:18,000
Private leagues in particular wouldn't be far away.

9222
03:39:18,000 --> 03:39:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

9223
03:39:20,000 --> 03:39:23,000
So, I mean, we'll have them, just not right initially, potentially.

9224
03:39:24,000 --> 03:39:26,000
And I think I did miss this, actually.

9225
03:39:26,000 --> 03:39:28,000
So, cluster jewels are a thing or not a thing?

9226
03:39:28,000 --> 03:39:30,000
Are they being kind of replaced by those radios?

9227
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:33,000
We replaced them with that almost like rollable timeless jewel kind of thing.

9228
03:39:33,000 --> 03:39:33,000
Yeah, that's cool.

9229
03:39:34,000 --> 03:39:39,000
At least for now, there's like so much passive tree there and the jewels accomplished the

9230
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:40,000
kind of off-build thing anyway.

9231
03:39:40,000 --> 03:39:44,000
You hardly need to add the extra passive trees on your passive trees yet.

9232
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:45,000
Yes, yes.

9233
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:46,000
That's after launch.

9234
03:39:46,000 --> 03:39:48,000
We made the passive tree implicitly bigger.

9235
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:51,000
The cluster jewels are in the tree already.

9236
03:39:51,000 --> 03:39:53,000
That's again, I talk about like year three features.

9237
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:56,000
That's around a year three to year five feature as well.

9238
03:39:56,000 --> 03:39:57,000
Yeah.

9239
03:39:57,000 --> 03:40:01,000
We've got another decade of what we had with Path of Exile 1 to look forward to for Path of

9240
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:05,000
Exile 2, hopefully, before we start worrying about Path of Exile 3, maybe.

9241
03:40:06,000 --> 03:40:06,000
Jeez.

9242
03:40:07,000 --> 03:40:10,000
Just start thinking about that.

9243
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:10,000
Give us a little while.

9244
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9245
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:18,000
So I guess to just finish this off for today then, do you guys have a recommendation of

9246
03:40:18,000 --> 03:40:20,000
what is the best class to play in the beta?

9247
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:23,000
I mean, that's a very hard one, honestly.

9248
03:40:24,000 --> 03:40:25,000
There's so many choices now.

9249
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:25,000
There are.

9250
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:27,000
So let me, well, okay.

9251
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:29,000
If we're going by the numbers.

9252
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:30,000
Oh, yeah.

9253
03:40:30,000 --> 03:40:34,000
If we go by player satisfaction reports per class, we break it down from the beta.

9254
03:40:34,000 --> 03:40:36,000
Yeah, I mean, this is good technical information here.

9255
03:40:36,000 --> 03:40:40,000
Then that means the monk is very interesting because the monk is the class that dies the

9256
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:41,000
most often.

9257
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:42,000
Yeah.

9258
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:45,000
But it's also the class that when people play it, they have the highest satisfaction level

9259
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:47,000
by a very, very tiny margin that compares to the others.

9260
03:40:48,000 --> 03:40:48,000
That's fascinating.

9261
03:40:48,000 --> 03:40:48,000
Yeah.

9262
03:40:48,000 --> 03:40:52,000
I mean, it is like glass cannon, you know, like it's very fast, but you have to retreat

9263
03:40:52,000 --> 03:40:53,000
and move in and out.

9264
03:40:54,000 --> 03:40:55,000
I fell in love with the monk playing it.

9265
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:56,000
It looks like it's got a little battery.

9266
03:40:56,000 --> 03:40:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

9267
03:40:56,000 --> 03:40:56,000
That's interesting.

9268
03:40:57,000 --> 03:41:01,000
But I think if you're a new player, then the mercenary, if you're like used to shooters

9269
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:03,000
and stuff, I think playing the mercenary could be a good win.

9270
03:41:03,000 --> 03:41:05,000
I really love that class.

9271
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:06,000
I don't know.

9272
03:41:06,000 --> 03:41:12,000
I've been loving the mercenary, but to me, it feels like you need to really be considering

9273
03:41:12,000 --> 03:41:13,000
each engagement a lot more.

9274
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:14,000
It's a bit more tactical.

9275
03:41:14,000 --> 03:41:15,000
Maybe.

9276
03:41:15,000 --> 03:41:15,000
I don't know.

9277
03:41:15,000 --> 03:41:16,000
I don't know.

9278
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:16,000
I like it.

9279
03:41:17,000 --> 03:41:18,000
I really like that.

9280
03:41:18,000 --> 03:41:19,000
You don't have that ability to correct if you make a mistake.

9281
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:24,000
Honestly, I mean, I go through favorite classes all the time whenever I change to play a

9282
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:25,000
different class that becomes my favorite.

9283
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:26,000
That's my current favorite.

9284
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:29,000
So, you know, yes, it's whatever I'm playing tends to be the thing.

9285
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:33,000
So, yeah, right now I'm doing a mercenary playthrough, so that's probably why I'm into that.

9286
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:34,000
But, yeah.

9287
03:41:35,000 --> 03:41:37,000
I'm not sure if you've got a similar film.

9288
03:41:37,000 --> 03:41:39,000
You were talking about the numbers as well.

9289
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:42,000
It was interesting that Monk and then Warrior had the highest satisfaction levels.

9290
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:42,000
Yes, Warrior.

9291
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:44,000
Warrior's next, by the way, technically, if you're looking for...

9292
03:41:44,000 --> 03:41:45,000
That's pretty good.

9293
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:47,000
That's two melee classes.

9294
03:41:47,000 --> 03:41:47,000
Exactly.

9295
03:41:48,000 --> 03:41:48,000
That's a win.

9296
03:41:48,000 --> 03:41:49,000
Yeah.

9297
03:41:49,000 --> 03:41:50,000
That's something going on.

9298
03:41:50,000 --> 03:41:52,000
I mean, they were dying a lot more at the time.

9299
03:41:52,000 --> 03:41:55,000
It's such a change from, like, especially early Path of Exile 1.

9300
03:41:55,000 --> 03:41:57,000
It's gotten a little better in modern days, but still.

9301
03:41:58,000 --> 03:42:03,000
I mean, I just have a, like, real desire to freeze time, so I just want to be a sorceress

9302
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:04,000
and just go through...

9303
03:42:04,000 --> 03:42:04,000
I don't know what skills I'll play.

9304
03:42:04,000 --> 03:42:06,000
It's good to get some sorceress love.

9305
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:07,000
I feel like she's not been getting enough attention.

9306
03:42:07,000 --> 03:42:10,000
I don't know what skills I'll play, but I definitely just want to be able to freeze time.

9307
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:12,000
So, it just feels cool.

9308
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:13,000
All right.

9309
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:15,000
So, you could be playing a crossbow build anyway.

9310
03:42:15,000 --> 03:42:17,000
Yeah, I might be a crossbow time freezer.

9311
03:42:17,000 --> 03:42:17,000
I don't know.

9312
03:42:18,000 --> 03:42:19,000
We'll see what's going on.

9313
03:42:19,000 --> 03:42:19,000
Yeah, all right.

9314
03:42:20,000 --> 03:42:23,000
I liked that I noted that our mercenaries were very different as well.

9315
03:42:23,000 --> 03:42:25,000
I was playing full grenade or you were combo.

9316
03:42:25,000 --> 03:42:27,000
I was doing the freeze shotgun.

9317
03:42:28,000 --> 03:42:28,000
Yeah, very cool.

9318
03:42:28,000 --> 03:42:29,000
Yeah.

9319
03:42:30,000 --> 03:42:32,000
Some sort of monk trigger build, obviously.

9320
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:34,000
It's always just going to be fun to play around with.

9321
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:36,000
Yeah, they have so many of those, like, stacking effects.

9322
03:42:37,000 --> 03:42:40,000
The wind and the ice coming off it, and the ascendancy showed some more as well.

9323
03:42:40,000 --> 03:42:45,000
Just see how far that can be pushed and how many spells can I get to trigger per second.

9324
03:42:47,000 --> 03:42:48,000
Monk does seem good for that.

9325
03:42:48,000 --> 03:42:49,000
All right.

9326
03:42:49,000 --> 03:42:51,000
Well, thank you very much for your time, both of you.

9327
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:53,000
I don't even know how long.

9328
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:54,000
That was a mammoth session.

9329
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:55,000
I think we're coming up to one o'clock here.

9330
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:56,000
So, you know.

9331
03:42:56,000 --> 03:42:58,000
There's still lots to talk about, but I think we just need some time to digest.

9332
03:42:58,000 --> 03:42:59,000
For sure.

9333
03:42:59,000 --> 03:42:59,000
For sure.

9334
03:43:00,000 --> 03:43:03,000
So, thankfully, we didn't have everyone saying patch notes when this time.

9335
03:43:04,000 --> 03:43:04,000
So good.

9336
03:43:04,000 --> 03:43:05,000
So good.

9337
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:05,000
So good.

9338
03:43:05,000 --> 03:43:06,000
So we should have a conversation.

9339
03:43:06,000 --> 03:43:07,000
There's no pressure on this.

9340
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:08,000
So, like, wrap it up, boys.

9341
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

9342
03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:09,000
Exactly.

9343
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:12,000
So, you know, that's good.

9344
03:43:12,000 --> 03:43:13,000
Fantastic.

9345
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:13,000
All right.

9346
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:15,000
Thank you very much for watching, everybody.

9347
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:16,000
I hope you enjoyed the Q&A.

9348
03:43:16,000 --> 03:43:17,000
That was a good day.

9349
03:43:17,000 --> 03:43:18,000
Oh, they want patch notes now.

9350
03:43:18,000 --> 03:43:18,000
Oh, patch notes.

9351
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:19,000
Well done.

9352
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:20,000
It's not a patch.

9353
03:43:20,000 --> 03:43:20,000
It's a launch.

9354
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:21,000
Exactly.

9355
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:23,000
Where's the launch notes?

9356
03:43:23,000 --> 03:43:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

9357
03:43:23,000 --> 03:43:24,000
Okay, okay.

9358
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:24,000
All right.

9359
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:24,000
All right.

9360
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:26,000
All right.

9361
03:43:26,000 --> 03:43:26,000
Yeah.

9362
03:43:26,000 --> 03:43:28,000
Thanks, heaps.

9363
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:29,000
Appreciate it.

9364
03:43:29,000 --> 03:43:30,000
It's been an epic journey.

9365
03:43:30,000 --> 03:43:31,000
It's kind of surreal.

9366
03:43:32,000 --> 03:43:34,000
And it's only the start of another journey, really.

9367
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:35,000
That's it.

9368
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:36,000
Yeah.

9369
03:43:36,000 --> 03:43:37,000
Can't wait to play.

9370
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:37,000
It's cool.

9371
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:39,000
I mean, I'm going to go play more now, but.

9372
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:39,000
Yeah.

9373
03:43:40,000 --> 03:43:40,000
That's true.

9374
03:43:41,000 --> 03:43:42,000
Sorry.

9375
03:43:42,000 --> 03:43:44,000
I've got to go fix bosses going up elevators.

9376
03:43:46,000 --> 03:43:46,000
Sorry.

9377
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:48,000
I'm just pre-bug testing.

9378
03:43:49,000 --> 03:43:49,000
All right.

9379
03:43:50,000 --> 03:43:52,000
I assume we've faded out and cut.

9380
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:52,000
Hopefully.

9381
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:53,000
You never know.

9382
03:43:53,000 --> 03:43:54,000
Hopefully.

9383
03:43:54,000 --> 03:43:54,000
Hopefully.

9384
03:43:56,000 --> 03:43:58,000
Hopefully.
