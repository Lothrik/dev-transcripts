1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The End

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Sir, just what are we facing here?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A relic of the old world.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ready your men, Captain.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We will only get one chance.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And remember, when you hear the whispers, call for help.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Do not attack!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
When you hear the whispers, what do you think he was on about?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's Dorman, right?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Uh, yeah.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then Dorman. Shut your damn mouth.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why do I always get stuck with these rookies?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, the kid's got a mean cleave. Give him a chance.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Quiet!

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Come on.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Leave, eh, Captain?

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A rookie can't even lift his own sword.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Captain Oren?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Captain?

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's here.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Rain! Send the signal!

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What the fuck?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Rain!

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
On my back, we'll be laid off!

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Come on, come on!

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm ready!

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm ready!

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a man!

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's not!

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Run!

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Run!

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Captain!

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Captain!

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Captain!

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It is over!

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why are you here?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Captain!

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Captain!

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Captain!

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It is over!

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why are you here?

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What is this?

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Stop!

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Humanity isn't ready.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
On your feet, lad.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Sir, the captain, I...

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You'll be fine.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Here.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What is this?

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Get the body.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Stop.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Murder.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It can still be contained.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You don't know what you have unleashed.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Your kind no longer control this world.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We cannot destroy your body, it's true.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But you will watch as we destroy everything you have built.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Bind him!

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Feed.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Grow, my child.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll make sure you can eat your food.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll make sure you can eat your food.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hi.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm Jonathan Rogers, game director on Path of Exile 2.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now, Path of Exile 2 is going into early access in around two weeks on December the 6th.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But even though it's early access, this isn't just some small taste.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The game is huge.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In this live stream, we're going to be introducing everything you can expect.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So without further ado, let's roll the gameplay trailer.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Existence is a thing of beauty.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Precious, but impermanent.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Life and death are mortal enemies, and yet bound to one another.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The continuation of life must be protected at all costs.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Some have said, my methods are brutal.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
To this I say, there can be no salvation without sacrifice.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:37,000
To this I say, there's no salvation without sacrifice.

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
To this I say, there's no salvation without sacrifice.

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Back to death are principalTS andmen in the air.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We are faced with the end, and I will do what I must.

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I must, but they're okay with my methods.

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Those who obsess with death

83
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let them soon be acquainted with it.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now as you just saw, even in Early Access, Path of Exile 2 is a big game.

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's actually been five years since we announced PoE 2, and over that time we've revealed a lot, but it's been in bits and pieces.

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's pretty hard to keep track of it all, so today we're going to do a full rundown of all the content that will be available at the start of Early Access.

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Classes, character progression systems, and for the first time, a full overview of the end game.

88
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is going to be a big one, so get comfortable.

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
For 20 years, Rhaeclast has been free from any sources of corruption.

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But the Count of Ogham, tempted by promises of power, intends to harness it once more.

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The dead are rising, monsters are mutating, and madness is spreading.

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Under the dark influence of corruption, the Count doles out sentences of death to any who would question him.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And this is where you find yourself at the start of PoE 2.

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Explore the dark forests of Ogham, traverse the barren plains of the Vesteri Desert, and delve into the jungle ruins of Utsal, an ancient Vaal city.

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There are challenging monsters, hidden runes, lost camps and treasures, roaming merchants, and of course, unique bosses.

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No two areas are the same.

97
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It falls to you to track down the seed of corruption, the source of all this devastation.

98
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:30,000
On the way, you'll face fearsome monsters, meet strange characters, forge unlikely bonds, and uncover lost civilizations.

99
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But first, you'll need to pick a class.

100
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Now, Early Access will initially have six classes available.

101
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's have a look at them.

102
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter.

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He dashes in and out of combat, and has mechanics that involve building up and keeping momentum.

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like all classes in PoE 2, you'll want to use a wide variety of skills to mix and match different combos.

105
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
To get new skills, you'll first need to find skill gems.

106
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Using a skill gem will open the Gem Cutting menu, which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2.

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You can choose an existing skill.

108
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Although he the other behind-the-angle assassinants

Thank you.

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you.

133
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Thank you.

134
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000


135
00:13:41,000 --> 00:14:11,000


136
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:41,000


137
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Thank you.

138
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:41,000


139
00:15:41,000 --> 00:16:11,000


140
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Thank you.

141
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Thank you.

142
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Thank you.

143
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Thank you.

144
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Thank you.

145
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Thank you.

146
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Thank you.

147
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Thank you.

148
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Thank you.

149
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:59,000


150
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Thank you.

151
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
you're also blocking the whole time,

152
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
so you have full damage immunity from the front.

153
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The Warrior also has access to Totems.

154
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Some Totems have built-in abilities, like Shockwave Totem,

155
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
which can be placed to stun nearby enemies

156
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and trigger aftershocks like those from the Earthquake.

157
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But you can also get Ancestral Warrior Totems,

158
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
which allow you to use any slam skill in your repertoire.

159
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This is a meta skill,

160
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
which means that it's a skill you can put other skills into.

161
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I can take a slam like Sunder

162
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and socket it into my Ancestral Warrior Totem.

163
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Now when I summon him, he'll sit there

164
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and slam the monsters from a distance.

165
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
There are 20 active skills for Maces,

166
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
so there's a lot more to try out.

167
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But by endgame, you're going to be dropping Hammish from the sky,

168
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
leaping fearlessly into combat

169
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and separating the very Earth you stand on.

170
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Time for some ranged attacks.

171
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The Ranger is primarily about the bow,

172
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
but we wanted to make sure that she feels agile as well.

173
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
In Pee-Wee 2, you can shoot while moving.

174
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Combined with all the skills the Ranger has that allow you to jump around,

175
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
you'll have a lot of mobility in combat.

176
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Bow skills have a variety of lightning, poison, ice and physical attacks.

177
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Lightning attacks bounce around between targets.

178
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You can also stick lightning arrows in the ground,

179
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
which explode when hit by the bouncers,

180
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
or electrocute enemies to take them out of combat.

181
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Ice attacks allow you to slow and freeze enemies to keep them away from you.

182
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Using poison, not only can you slowly damage your enemies from afar,

183
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but also grow some interesting plants.

184
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
With 21 bow skills and all the mobility and combo tools the Ranger has,

185
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
you can take advantage of every situation.

186
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
By endgame, you'll be creating hundreds of arrows,

187
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
be they falling from the sky, bouncing around between enemies

188
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
or spraying out of tornadoes.

189
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You might have noticed in the bottom left of the screen

190
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
that the flask slots look a little different.

191
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In Pee-Wee 2, you have one dedicated life flask slot

192
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and one mana flask slot.

193
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Flasks gain charges as you kill enemies

194
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and typically allow you to heal six or seven times if they're full.

195
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But that's not the only thing you can use charges for.

196
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Charms are a new item type

197
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that will automatically defend you

198
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
from various debuffs or damage types.

199
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Having trouble with getting frozen?

200
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Equip a thawing charm.

201
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
When it's fully charged,

202
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
it will make you immune to freeze for three seconds

203
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
if you get frozen.

204
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
To recharge them, just kill more monsters.

205
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You can use a thawing charm.

206
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You can use a thawing charm.

207
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You can use a thawing charm.

208
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You can gain more slots for charms

209
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
by upgrading your belt.

210
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The Mercenary wields a crossbow

211
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
that can be loaded with different ammo types

212
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
offering versatility, power and mobility.

213
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
All classes in Path of Exile 2

214
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
can be controlled with WASD

215
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
which makes this class play exactly like a shooter.

216
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
For the crossbow,

217
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you will find skills that work like shotguns,

218
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
sniper rifles,

219
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
assault rifles

220
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and even grenade launchers.

221
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But not only that,

222
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
there are a wide variety of more interesting elemental ammos too.

223
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's very fast to switch between ammo types

224
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
so long as you already have them loaded

225
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
which makes the Mercenary able to combo abilities together

226
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
for devastating effect.

227
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Use Glacial Bolt to create walls of ice to separate enemies

228
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
then switch to Fragmentation rounds

229
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
to explode the ice dealing massive AOE damage.

230
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If I come across an armoured enemy,

231
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I could use armour piercing rounds to break their armour

232
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and then high velocity rounds to take them down.

233
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Or perhaps I could fire a gas grenade to poison enemies

234
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
before detonating the cloud with an explosive shot

235
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
for massive damage.

236
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If you want to call in some suppressing fire,

237
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you can summon artillery ballisters.

238
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
These have a minimum range

239
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
so you'll want to prepare your position carefully

240
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
before moving in.

241
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There are 22 active skills for crossbows.

242
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
By endgame,

243
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
you'll be calling destruction down from the sky

244
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
as you litter the battlefield with grenades

245
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and pepper your enemies with your automatic shotgun.

246
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If you're looking to take a backseat

247
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and let your minions do the work,

248
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
then the witch should be your choice.

249
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
She can call forth hordes of undead monsters

250
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
to fight for her

251
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
casting powerful chaos spells

252
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
that debilitate her enemies.

253
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Occult skills are some of the most varied in the game

254
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
with skeletons,

255
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
noxious spells,

256
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
specialty minions,

257
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
curses and sacrificial magic.

258
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Before we talk about minions,

259
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
we'll have to talk about a new resource

260
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
in Path of Exile 2 called Spirit.

261
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is a spirit gem

262
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
which allows you to pick from a range of persistent skills.

263
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
All classes have a variety of these skills

264
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
which can add some very interesting effects

265
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
like Arctic armour

266
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
which does cold damage to enemies that hit you

267
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
or raging spirits

268
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
which summon fiery skulls

269
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
each time you cast a fire spell.

270
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
For the witch though,

271
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
we'll want to be using our spirit

272
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
to create permanent minions.

273
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
These minions will be revived

274
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
automatically when they die

275
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
so you don't have to worry

276
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
about resummoning them all the time.

277
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Here I'm using the skill screen

278
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
to allocate which minions

279
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I would like in my horde.

280
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You can see the spirit cost of each one.

281
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Skeletal Warriors are cheap but weak,

282
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
useful for tanking damage

283
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and distracting enemies.

284
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But I want more heavy hitters in my army

285
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
so I'm going to unsummon some warriors

286
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and instead add skeletal arsonists.

287
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Permanent minions

288
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
come with special active abilities

289
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
called command skills.

290
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You can order these guys

291
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
to detonate your own minions

292
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
for even more damage

293
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and air of effect.

294
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If you want a bigger army

295
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
you'll need a scepter.

296
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This new weapon type is imbued

297
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
with even more spirit

298
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
allowing you to summon

299
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
even more friends.

300
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And if you want an even bigger

301
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
army than that

302
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
you can take advantage of corpses

303
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
to summon true hordes of minions.

304
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But what can a witch do

305
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
while her army is at work?

306
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Well, she has a range of

307
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
chaos spells

308
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
to spread disease

309
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
amongst your enemies

310
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
or bone skills to impale them.

311
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Or, you know,

312
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
you could curse them

313
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
to make them weaker

314
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
so your horde can take them down.

315
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There are 25 active occult skills.

316
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
By the endgame

317
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,000
you'll be the leader

318
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
of a fearsome army of the dead

319
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
consuming everything in its path.

320
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The sorceress bends

321
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
the elements to her will

322
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
using them to unleash

323
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
devastation on her foes.

324
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This classic spellcaster

325
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
weaves a flurry

326
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
of elemental magic

327
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
from afar.

328
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The elemental skills

329
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
have everything

330
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
you might expect

331
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and more.

332
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Fireballs,

333
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
icy explosions,

334
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
lightning storms.

335
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You get the ability

336
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to use the ability

337
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
to use the power

338
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
of the enemy.

339
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You can use the power

340
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
of the enemy.

341
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You can use the power

342
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
of the enemy.

343
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You can use the power

344
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
of the enemy.

345
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You can use the power

346
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
of the enemy.

347
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
At times you get the idea.

348
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Each spell is unique

349
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and has many different ways

350
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
to build and combo

351
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
with others,

352
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
even between different elements.

353
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
For example,

354
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Flamewall conjures

355
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
a burning line

356
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
that not only damages enemies,

357
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
but also empowers

358
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
all projectiles

359
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that pass through it.

360
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If you place a wall

361
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and fire lightning sparks

362
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
through it,

363
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
they'll gain extra fire damage.

364
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's a good idea

365
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
to take advantage

366
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
of the ability

367
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
to automatically swap weapons

368
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
when you use certain skills.

369
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Having a special staff

370
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
with bonuses

371
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
to fire skills

372
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and another with bonuses

373
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
to lightning skills

374
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
can really power up

375
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
a combo like this.

376
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The sorceress

377
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
can also take advantage

378
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
of powerful trigger jams.

379
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
For example,

380
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
you could grab the

381
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
cast and ignite gem

382
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and use it with firestorm.

383
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
As you ignite enemies,

384
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
a counter will go up

385
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
in the top left corner.

386
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
When it's full,

387
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
a firestorm will automatically

388
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
be cast at the enemy

389
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
that was ignited.

390
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There are 25 active

391
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
elemental skills.

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
By endgame,

393
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
you'll be firing off

394
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
projectiles left and right

395
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
as you rain down

396
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
elemental storms

397
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
on your foes.

398
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
the enemy's enemies

399
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and the enemy's enemies

400
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
will be firing off.

401
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Now,

402
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
those are the characters

403
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
that will be available

404
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
at the start of early access.

405
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But we will be adding

406
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
six more character classes

407
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
with just as many skills

408
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and options as these.

409
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
There's a lot more to come.

410
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
There's one more important thing

411
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
to mention about skills.

412
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Even though we talk about them

413
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
as belong to each class,

414
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
in reality,

415
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
there are no restrictions.

416
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You can use all these skills

417
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
on any class

418
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
so long as you have the attributes.

419
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
For example,

420
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
a poison ranger might want

421
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
to try out using occult curses

422
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
to increase her poison damage.

423
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Or a monk might want

424
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
to trigger elemental ice walls

425
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
to use with his glacial cascade combo.

426
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The possibilities for cross-class combos

427
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
are practically unlimited.

428
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
We're looking forward

429
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
to what kind of things

430
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
you guys might find.

431
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Now,

432
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Path of Exile is a game

433
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
known for build customization,

434
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and we haven't even scratched

435
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
the surface of what is possible yet.

436
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So let's talk about support gems.

437
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Path of Exile 2 has a system of support gems

438
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
that can be combined

439
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
with your active skills

440
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
to dramatically change

441
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
the way they work.

442
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
If you find a support gem,

443
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
then right-clicking it

444
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
will open up this screen.

445
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Here you will find a variety

446
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
of recommended support gems

447
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
for each of your skills

448
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
that you can pick between.

449
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
For example,

450
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
this is a multiple projectiles support gem

451
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and can be used to add

452
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
multiple projectiles to any skill.

453
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Normally,

454
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
when you fire a grenade,

455
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
it'll look like this.

456
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But if you can use it,

457
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
you can use it.

458
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You can use it.

459
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You can use it.

460
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You can use it.

461
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You can use it.

462
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But if we add multiple projectiles,

463
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
then you get three of them.

464
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Once you have the gem,

465
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
you can also freely move it

466
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
between any of the skills

467
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
in your character.

468
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If you want to have

469
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
a multi-shot sniper rifle instead,

470
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
then simply move the gem over

471
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
to your high-velocity round skill.

472
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Generally speaking,

473
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
if it sounds like a support gem

474
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
should work with a skill,

475
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
then it will work.

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So it's a good idea to experiment.

477
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Note that you can only have

478
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
one of each support gem

479
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
on your character,

480
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
so you'll want to think carefully

481
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
about which supports

482
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
can be used best

483
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
with each skill

484
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
for maximum damage.

485
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Now, if you want to stick

486
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
to the recommendations,

487
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
you should have

488
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
a perfectly good time.

489
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
But if you want to experiment

490
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
a bit more,

491
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
then uncheck that

492
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
recommended button

493
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and you can see the full list

494
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
of supports that will work

495
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
with your skill.

496
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
There are hundreds of support gems

497
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
to choose from,

498
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and even we don't know

499
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
the results of all the possible

500
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
ways these can interact.

501
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Each skill can have up to

502
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
five supports socketed into it.

503
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And if you're clever,

504
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
you can come up with

505
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
some pretty interesting ideas.

506
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Now all of this is just

507
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
scratching the surface.

508
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You can make frost vortexes,

509
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
break people's armor,

510
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
make minions explode,

511
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
make skills repeat,

512
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
make enemies set each other on fire,

513
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
cull enemies or pin them to the ground.

514
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It supports that you drastically change

515
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
the behavior of your skills

516
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
and create your own unique build,

517
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
or at least follow someone's OP build guide.

518
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So, speaking of builds,

519
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
let's talk about one of the most iconic

520
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Path of Exile systems,

521
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
the passive skill tree.

522
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes, it's huge.

523
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
There are over 1500 nodes on there.

524
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Now a lot of people open the tree

525
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and can get a little intimidated at first,

526
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
but try not to be scared.

527
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
There are lots of options,

528
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
but at its core,

529
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
it's pretty simple.

530
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Each level you get one point

531
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
to put into the tree.

532
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Each class starts at a different location,

533
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
but they all share the same tree.

534
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Around your section of the tree,

535
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
you'll find relevant bonuses

536
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
for your character.

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You should be safe in the knowledge

538
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
that there aren't many wrong choices here.

539
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Almost all the starting nodes

540
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
will be useful for your character

541
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
in some way.

542
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But if you do happen to make a choice

543
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
you regret,

544
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
you'll be able to respec

545
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
any nodes you've taken

546
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
by spending a little bit of gold.

547
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Now, the tree is generally divided up

548
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
into clusters which have similar themes.

549
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
In each cluster,

550
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
you will find small nodes

551
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
that give simple bonuses

552
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
like increased damage,

553
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
but the real power comes from notables.

554
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Notables normally have much more

555
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
interesting bonuses,

556
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and they tend to care a lot more

557
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
about how your build works

558
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and what skills you're using.

559
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
For example,

560
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
in the mercenary area of the tree,

561
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
this one gives a 25% chance

562
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
for crossbow skills

563
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
to not consume a bolt.

564
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And here's one that gives grenades

565
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
a chance to blow up a second time.

566
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This one gives a chance for projectiles

567
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
to rebound off terrain,

568
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
as well as giving you some pierce chance

569
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
to make that more likely.

570
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Note that even though this is

571
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
in the mercenary section,

572
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
this would work with projectiles

573
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
from all classes,

574
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
so there are often reasons

575
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
to go to different areas of the tree.

576
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
In order to get between these clusters,

577
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
you will generally have to allocate nodes

578
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
in the attribute highways.

579
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Attribute nodes allow you to pick

580
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
which attribute you would like to use,

581
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
so it's very easy to get points

582
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
for any attribute that your gear might need.

583
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You can change which attribute

584
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
these nodes give you for half price

585
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
at the respec vendor.

586
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
In addition to notables,

587
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
you will also find even larger passives

588
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
called keystones.

589
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Keystones have both an upside

590
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and a downside,

591
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and often require changing your entire build

592
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
to design around them.

593
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
A great example is Giant's Blood,

594
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
which allows you to wield two-hand weapons

595
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
in a single hand,

596
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
but doubles the attribute requirements off them.

597
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You can use a two-hand mace with a shield,

598
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
or even dual-wield them.

599
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Or how about Mind Over Matter,

600
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
which makes all damage go to your mana pool first

601
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
before your life pool,

602
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
but you lose 50% of your mana regen.

603
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Skills like these can be tough to build around,

604
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
but if you're up for the challenge,

605
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
they can be very rewarding.

606
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
As we showed you earlier on the Sorceress,

607
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
you can swap between weapon sets on the fly

608
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
as you use certain skills.

609
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
One of the new features in Path of Exile 2's passive tree

610
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
is that you can choose to have your passive tree

611
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
to have your passive tree

612
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and use your mana pool.

613
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You can swap between weapon sets on the fly

614
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
as you use certain skills.

615
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
One of the new features in Path of Exile 2's passive tree

616
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
is that you can choose to have your passive tree

617
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
change as you switch between weapon sets

618
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
to take advantage of specific bonuses on the tree.

619
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
For the Sorceress,

620
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
you might want to change between

621
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
fire and lightning specialization.

622
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Or you could switch between one-hand

623
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and a two-hand setup

624
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
in order to be able to block boss attacks

625
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
while following up with heavy hits

626
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
from your bigger mace.

627
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Or perhaps you could have a full curse setup

628
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
on your witch to debuff enemies

629
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
before switching to a chaos degen build

630
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
for maximum damage.

631
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
If you're able to block boss attacks

632
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
or you could have a full curse setup

633
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
on your witch to debuff enemies

634
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
before switching to a chaos degen build

635
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
for maximum damage.

636
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
If you want to stick with just one weapon set,

637
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
you can just use these specialization points

638
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
as bonus points to invest however you like.

639
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But creative players will find plenty of opportunities

640
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
with this system.

641
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You can get weapon specialization points

642
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
throughout the campaign

643
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
from optional bosses and quests.

644
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
For example,

645
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
if I manage to defeat the Crowbell,

646
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'll get a weapon specialization book.

647
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
There are lots of other permanent boosts

648
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
available from the campaign too.

649
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
On the map you can see icons that indicate

650
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
the many optional encounters you can find.

651
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Some of them have permanent character boosts

652
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and others have powerful items.

653
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
If you're having trouble getting past a boss,

654
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
it might be a good idea to explore

655
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and see what you can find.

656
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
For example,

657
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
if you defeat Blackjaw the Remnant,

658
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
you'll gain a permanent increase to fire resistance.

659
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
One of the most important finds are spirit bonuses.

660
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You can find the first one here in the canopy in Act 1.

661
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Defeat the boss in this area

662
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to acquire a permanent addition of spirit.

663
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The permanent buffs you gain from spirit are very powerful,

664
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and every class will find the use for them,

665
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
so make sure you hunt down these upgrades.

666
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
There's one in each act.

667
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Now we haven't even talked about

668
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
the most important element of character progression, items.

669
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
That's why we're all here, right?

670
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Items in Path of Exile can be broken down

671
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
into four rarity groups,

672
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Normal, Magic, Rare and Unique.

673
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
One of the things you're going to want to do

674
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
as you play through the campaign

675
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
is upgrade the items you find,

676
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and you can do that with currency items.

677
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
An Orb of Transmutation will allow you

678
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
to upgrade a normal item to a magic item with one mod.

679
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You can then apply an Orb of Augmentation

680
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to add a second mod,

681
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
then use a Regal Orb to add a third mod,

682
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and upgrade it to a rare.

683
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Finally, you can use some Exalted Orbs

684
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
to add more mods to your rare to a total of six mods.

685
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
One of the things we think is really important

686
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
is to make these options available to use as you play.

687
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
All the items that add mods are much more common

688
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
than they were in Path of Exile 1,

689
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
so that you can use them throughout your campaign playthrough.

690
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
We want you to find things on the ground

691
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
that can be crafted into upgrades much more frequently.

692
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
As well as making the drop rates on these items

693
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
much more common,

694
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
you can also get them by disenchanting unwanted gear

695
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
at the magic item vendor.

696
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
If you disenchant magic items,

697
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you can build up to an Orb of Transmutation,

698
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and by disenchanting rares,

699
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
you can build up to Regal Orbs.

700
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Another important area of crafting items in PoE2 is sockets.

701
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Some items you find will have sockets

702
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
that can have Ezimite runes placed in them

703
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
that add more mods to the item.

704
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
If I insert this glacial rune into my helmet,

705
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
it will give extra cold resistance.

706
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
This is a great way to solve problems

707
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that you have with your build,

708
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
like resistances or damage.

709
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If you find socketed items that you don't have a use for,

710
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
you can take them to the salvage bench in town

711
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
to work towards an artificer's orb.

712
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
This will allow you to add sockets to your existing items.

713
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Body armours and two-hand weapons can have up to two sockets,

714
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
while the rest of your armour and one-hand weapons

715
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
can only have one socket.

716
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You can also salvage items with quality

717
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
to create items like armour scraps or whetstones.

718
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
These will allow you to increase the quality of your items

719
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
for an up to 20% boost.

720
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
If you don't want to disenchant or salvage your items,

721
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
you can always sell them for gold.

722
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Gold can be used to buy items from vendors,

723
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and we've tried to do a lot to make sure

724
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
that the items they have for sale are actually useful.

725
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Every time you level up, they get more stock,

726
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
so make sure to check back often.

727
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Other vendors offer a gamble.

728
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Pay a flat amount of gold,

729
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and you'll get a random item of a specific type.

730
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
This could be a great way to improve your gear,

731
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
if you're lucky.

732
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Gold is also used to respec your passive skills.

733
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Take advantage of this system to experiment with your tree

734
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and rework it as required.

735
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The other thing you might want to use gold for

736
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
is the currency exchange.

737
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
This allows you to exchange currency items

738
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
with other players on an open market,

739
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
in exchange for a small gold fee.

740
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Now, all items in Path of Exile are freely tradable.

741
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We never bind anything to your character, except gold.

742
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Now, most gear in Path of Exile 2 is randomly generated,

743
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
but there's another type that isn't.

744
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Uniques.

745
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
They are especially rare,

746
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
each with a handcrafted set of unusual mods

747
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
which can dramatically change a character's build.

748
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
They're not just better rare items.

749
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
They can do much stranger things

750
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
that can fundamentally change your character.

751
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Corpse Wade will make any corpses you run through

752
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
explode into clouds of poison.

753
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The Sands of Silk is a body armour that changes your dodge roll

754
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
into a blink, morphing you into sand as you teleport past your foes.

755
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And of course, some uniques are just pure hits of dopamine,

756
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
like Quill Rain, which just turns your bow attacks into full auto

757
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
by doubling your attack speed.

758
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Each unique is something that you can build your character around.

759
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We try to make sure that most unique items have a potential use at endgame,

760
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
even if you find them early on.

761
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And as you can see, every single unique item comes with custom art to match.

762
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The last character progression system that you can do during the campaign is Ascension.

763
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Starting in Act 2, you will come across Ascension Trials,

764
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
tests that you must complete to unlock your Ascension class.

765
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
We'll explain these trials soon,

766
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
but first let's take a look at what Ascending can do for your character.

767
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Each class has access to three Ascendancy classes,

768
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
but at the start of early access, only two per class will be available.

769
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Ascendancy classes are unique to each character class,

770
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
so choose wisely.

771
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
They can drastically affect how you build your character.

772
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
As a Sorceress, you could become a Stormweaver,

773
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
a master of the elements.

774
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Tempest Caller causes elemental storms to be summoned

775
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
each time you do a critical hit with a spell.

776
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
With Strike Twice, you can stack two copies of Shock for more damage,

777
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
and going deeper into the tree,

778
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
you can make all your damage-type supply Shock.

779
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Make a Shock build from any skill.

780
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Alternatively, you could become a Chronomancer and command time itself.

781
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
She literally has the ability to stop time with Time Freeze.

782
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Not only that, but she has many other time manipulation abilities.

783
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Using Temporal Rift, she can teleport back to a previous location,

784
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
resetting her life and mana back to what it was.

785
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Or with Time Snap, she can reset all her cooldowns

786
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and cast all her spells again.

787
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
On the Warrior, you can choose between the Warbringer or the Titan.

788
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
The Warbringer channels the might of his ancestors

789
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
to gain tremendous power.

790
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Using Answered Call, you can summon ancestral spirits

791
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
linked to each of your totems.

792
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
With Jade Heritage, you can encase your body in a protective layer

793
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
that absorbs all damage until it breaks.

794
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Warcaller's Bellow allows you to explode the corpses of your enemies.

795
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And with Great Wolf's Howl, you can ignore the cooldowns of your Warcries.

796
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Let all that anger out.

797
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
The Titan class is all about hitting big.

798
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
With Earthbreaker, every slam is a chance to create an Aftershock.

799
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
With Crushing Impacts, every hit becomes a Crushing Blow,

800
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
which will allow you to stun your enemies with ease.

801
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
With Surprising Strength, you can take advantage of stunned enemies

802
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
to deal 40% more damage.

803
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
As a Ranger, you might choose to be a Deadeye,

804
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
an expert markswoman who can take down foes with style.

805
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
With endless munitions, every attack gains an extra projectile.

806
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
With Gathering Winds, she gains a small increase to movement speed

807
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
with every attack.

808
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
But be careful, she loses them when getting hit.

809
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
With Eagle Eyes, she will never miss, allowing you to stop wasting all those passer points on accuracy.

810
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Alternatively, you could become a Pathfinder, the master of flasks and poison.

811
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
She can choose from one of several throwable concoctions,

812
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
allowing her to spend her flask charges to throw explosive bottles

813
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
that deal various types of damage.

814
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
A Bleeding Concoction will make your enemies bleed,

815
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
while a fulminating one can shock your enemies, allowing you to do extra damage.

816
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Contagious Contamination allows her to spread poisons between her foes,

817
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
while Overwhelming Toxicity doubles the number of stacks they can be infected by.

818
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Running Assault allows her to move much more quickly while firing,

819
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
while Relentless Pursuit makes her totally immune to being slowed by enemies.

820
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The Witch can ascend into the Infernalist or the Blood Mage.

821
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
As an Infernalist, she can summon a loyal Hellhound companion.

822
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The Hellhound sets enemies on fire, as well as taking a percentage of the damage if the Infernalist gets hit.

823
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
With Pyromantic Pact, you can turn your mana into Infernal Flame.

824
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
As you cast more spells, the flame builds up, and if it overflows, you'll take damage.

825
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Using Bringer of Flame, you'll want to make sure you keep the flames topped up.

826
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
While your Infernal Flame is above 30%, all damage from you and your minions will ignite enemies.

827
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
She can also transform into a literal demon.

828
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
While in demon form, she takes an increasing amount of damage,

829
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
but her cast speed and damage increase rapidly as well.

830
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So if you're planning on transforming into a demon, make sure you stack a lot of life recovery.

831
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
She can also become a Blood Mage, a master of life and energy.

832
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
All Blood Mages must pay the price of making skills cost life as well as mana,

833
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
but in exchange, every monster they kill will drop life remnants,

834
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
which allow them to quickly gain back that life.

835
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
With Crimson Power, she can gain large amounts of extra life,

836
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
and with Vitality Syphon, she can use her spells to leech life back as well.

837
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Once you've got a significant amount of life, you can use Gore Spike to make your critical hit steal

838
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
incredible amounts of damage.

839
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
A monk who is in tune with the elements might become an Invoker.

840
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
With Elemental Expression, the Invoker will create waves of elemental power each time he does a critical strike.

841
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
With Faith as a Choice, you gain the ability to meditate, allowing you to double your energy shield.

842
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Choose between I am the Blizzard or I am the Thunder to specialize in Cold or Lightning.

843
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And I Shall Rage will allay to turn into an unbound avatar.

844
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Each time you apply a status ailment to an enemy, you gain unbound fury.

845
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
When you have enough, transform into an avatar to deal way more damage and inflict even more elemental ailments.

846
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Some monks choose to reach into the darkness instead.

847
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The Acolyte of Chayula can exchange their mastery of spirit for darkness,

848
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
a resource that can be utilized to both absorb and deal damage.

849
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:00,000
The Shroud of Darkness will protect you from all damage incoming, but if you take grasp of the Void, you will deal extra chaos damage from all the darkness you have.

850
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Their Dark Pact offers greatly increased resistances to chaos damage and can allow their mana leech to not only happen instantly, but apply to their energy shield as well.

851
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Another node you can take is Waking Dream, which allows you to see into the domain of the breach demons.

852
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
There you will see the Flames of Chayula that can be taken to gain life, mana and damage.

853
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
The Mercenary has a job to do, but which job suits you? You might choose to become a witch hunter.

854
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Obsessive Rituals will give you a sorcery ward, allowing you to defend yourself against elemental hits in exchange for less defense against attacks.

855
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
With Zealous Inquisition, your enemies have a 10% chance to explode on death. The chances doubled against demons and undead.

856
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
With Judge, Jury and Executioner, your initial hit against enemies can deal up to 30% of their life in damage, if you're lucky.

857
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
This is great for hunting powerful bosses.

858
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And with Witch Bane, you can break your enemies' concentration, preventing them from casting spells as often as they would usually do.

859
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You could also choose to become a Gemling Legionnaire, enhancing your abilities by embedding gems directly in your flesh.

860
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Integrated efficiency will give you extra skill slots.

861
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Thermatological Infusion gives you extra maximum resistances as you sock up more and more support gems.

862
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Adaptive Capability allows you to use any color of gem without worrying about attributes,

863
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
while Crystalline Potential adds extra quality bonuses to every gem socketed into your character.

864
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So those are the Ascendancy classes for the start of Early Access.

865
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But one thing we haven't talked about yet is how you ascend in the first place.

866
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Ascension in Path of Exile 2 requires completion of one of the Great Trials, which you'll find as you progress through the campaign.

867
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Each one is associated with one of the major cultures of Rhaeclast.

868
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Located in the Vasteri Plains are the Marraketh, a culture of rich tales and brutal traditions, who must do whatever it takes to survive in the desert.

869
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
The highest position in Marraketh culture is a Sekima, and it is not a title given freely.

870
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,000
All aspirants must complete the Trial of the Sekimas, a gruelling gauntlet that will test their strength, will, cunning and patience.

871
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
To enter, a warrior of the Marraketh must prove their worth by trapping the soul of a Djinn in a coin, and you are no different.

872
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Once you have earned your coin, it may be placed in the Relic Altar to begin the Trial.

873
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
In the Trial of the Sekimas, each room has its own challenges to overcome.

874
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
In this room, each rare monster you kill will send its blood to the chalice in the centre of the room.

875
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Once the chalice is filled, you will be able to proceed.

876
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
While fighting monsters in the Trial, you will need to be very careful.

877
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Each hit will not only hurt you, but will damage your honour.

878
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The monsters are well telegraphed, so that you can avoid their attacks, but if you run out of honour, you will fail the Trial and need to find another coin in order to try again.

879
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It is a good idea to make sure that you are well prepared before challenging the Trial of the Sekimas.

880
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
After each room, you will be rewarded.

881
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
In this case, you have been given a key that can be used to unlock chests later in the Trial.

882
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Once you have claimed your reward, you will be shown a map of the rest of the floor, and may choose how you wish to proceed.

883
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Which challenges would you like to face, and which rewards do you want to claim?

884
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Some rooms are more dangerous, afflicting you with debuffs that will persist for the entire Trial.

885
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
For example, entering this room will afflict you with spiked shell that will cause all monsters in the rest of the Trial to have 50% increased life.

886
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You will want to take care if you choose such a path.

887
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There are many different challenges and rewards as you journey through the Trial.

888
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Deadly traps, waves of monsters, and strange artefacts will test your honour.

889
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
As you progress, you will be able to gain boons from the Djinn, which will help you on your journey.

890
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
For example, the Sekimer's Cloak will revive you once if you die, giving you a second shot at a run.

891
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
One of the rewards you may find is Sacred Water, an extremely valuable and treasured resource to the Djinn and the Mariketh.

892
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Trading it with the Djinn will allow you to receive many benefits.

893
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
You can recover honour, gain additional boons, or remove afflictions.

894
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
At the end of the floor, you will find a powerful boss which will truly test your limitations.

895
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
In order to ascend, you will need to defeat him.

896
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Having defeated the boss, you've earned the right to ascend. But first, the loot.

897
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The keys you have found may be used to open the various treasures in the vault at the end of the floor.

898
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
We only have a single bronze key, so we'll just have to open one of these small chests.

899
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
If you want to open the better ones, you'll need silver or gold keys.

900
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Let's use the Altar of Ascendancy.

901
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Your first ascension will allow you to pick your class and grant you two points to use in the tree.

902
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Now there are more flaws and many more rewards that can be found within the Trial of the Sekimus, but we'll save that for the section on the end game.

903
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
For now, let's talk about the second ascendancy trial, the Trial of Chaos.

904
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
In Path of Exile 2, you can choose whichever trial you like to earn your ascension.

905
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Each culture on Wraeclast had their own methods to ascend.

906
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
If the Trial of the Sekimus is not your kind of playstyle, or you're finding it too difficult, you could try another.

907
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You can gain all your ascension points from just one, or mix and match them. It's up to you.

908
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
For early access, we will have two trials as options, with a third trial coming later for the full release.

909
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
While exploring the Vaal jungle, you'll discover the Temple of Chaos.

910
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Before the Vaal embraced the science of corruption, their civilization worshipped Chaos.

911
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
This ancient trial was once used by the Vaal to test their High Priests.

912
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
A High Priest of the Vaal must show willingness to risk everything to gain power.

913
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Entry to the trial requires a token from a strange entity known only as the Trial Master.

914
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
For those in which he sees potential, he shall inscribe an ultimatum.

915
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Many have attempted these trials in search of greatness. Most have perished.

916
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Will you be able to defy the odds?

917
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Before you begin each chamber, the Trial Master will offer you a reward and a choice.

918
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Choose one of three Tribulations to affect you through the rest of the trial.

919
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
These modifiers might beef up the monsters, curse the player, or add environmental hazards like turrets or trap runes.

920
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
In this case, we will be picking Shocking Turrets.

921
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
As you enter the room, the Trial Master will fill it with hazards to test your commitment.

922
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
In this case, you must destroy all the monsters that fill the room, while dealing with the lightning projectiles from the Shocking Turrets.

923
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
After each room you will need to make a choice.

924
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Take the rewards you have earned once again, depending on the goal, sony will heal.

925
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Once you enter the effectiveness, it'll turn into the next console related to the surveillance 카 won and distress stars,

926
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
or defeat the Gra frenteians.

927
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Feel which makes sure you will choose a speed loopנו

928
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
and make your 600 pre-meanternals.

929
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Take the rewards you have earned so far, or go double or nothing.

930
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Increase your rewards, but take on more risk.

931
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Each tribulation you add is minor on its own,

932
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
but they quickly stack on top of each other and can become overwhelming.

933
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
There are many types of chambers in the trial.

934
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Each will test your resolve in different ways.

935
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
This one simply requires you survive for a certain amount of time.

936
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Another requires you to escort the stone idol through the level

937
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
as elevators full of monsters descend to attack you.

938
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Should you be able to get through the first three chambers,

939
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
you will face your first boss.

940
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
The order of the bosses is random,

941
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and combined with the tribulations you have selected,

942
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
the fight will never feel the same.

943
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
After defeating the boss, you may claim your rewards.

944
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Of course there are the items, but you also gain the right to ascend.

945
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
If you already did the trial of the Sekimers,

946
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
then you can claim two more points to add to your ascendancy class.

947
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Now it's possible to go much deeper.

948
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
There are more bosses, rewards and risks to take.

949
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
But we'll talk more about that when we get to Endgame.

950
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So how about we talk about that now?

951
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So far we've only been showing you footage from the campaign,

952
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
but some people would argue that the Endgame is where the game truly begins.

953
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Something that happens almost every time a new action RPG launches is people saying,

954
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
there isn't enough Endgame content.

955
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Well, we want to make sure that in PoE 2 people don't feel that way,

956
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and we actually only changed our development priority for this recently.

957
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
The first three acts of PoE 2 already take around 25 hours to complete if you're a new player.

958
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
This is already a pretty significant campaign.

959
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
On the other hand, people spend hundreds of hours in Endgame each league.

960
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
We realized that finishing the rest of the campaign for Early Access was actually a bad idea.

961
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Instead of having acts 4 to 6 in Early Access, we could concentrate on Endgame and make that great.

962
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
For new players, a 25-hour campaign is already a huge game with lots of content.

963
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
But for existing action RPG players, what you mostly care about is all the Endgame challenges to overcome.

964
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So several months ago, we switched the entire development team's focus over to making Endgame content.

965
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
At the start of Early Access, there will be 50 bosses and around 400 monster types.

966
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
But the great thing is that the rest of the game is like 80% there.

967
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
We'll be adding content to roughly double the size of the game during Early Access and into release.

968
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Now, in order to make the Endgame happen at the same character level as what it would be after we added the rest of the acts,

969
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
we've added a second difficulty level called Cruel,

970
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
where you repeat the campaign with all the monsters and bosses leveled up, and of course new rewards.

971
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
You can kind of think of it as like a new game plus.

972
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's also a lot faster to get through the content the second time as your clear speed increases.

973
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
That will take you to around level 65, where the Endgame begins.

974
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Once we add, the remaining three acts will be removing Cruel difficulty,

975
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
so you'll progress straight from the end of Act 6 to Endgame.

976
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
But what is the Endgame?

977
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
To explain that, I'll hand over to Mark. He can tell you all about it.

978
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Hi, I'm Mark Roberts, Game Director on Path of Exile 2.

979
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Well, one thing that Path of Exile is known for is having a lot of distinct Endgame content to choose between.

980
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Each Endgame mechanic needs to have its own progression system, areas, bosses, rewards, and player power that can only be gained from that content.

981
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
We are going to be adding a lot more over time, but for Path of Exile 2 we decided to start with seven distinct systems you can progress through.

982
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
This is the Atlas, and it serves as the core of the Endgame for Path of Exile 2.

983
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It's infinite and expands in all directions.

984
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Now, we are not going to spoil the plot too much here, but corruption from the beast has blighted the land, and your objective is to help fight it.

985
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:01,000
In the center of the Atlas you will find the Ziggurat, a temple in which the Vaal research the fundamentals of space and time.

986
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Here, we can open portals to nearby locations and begin cleansing corruption and finding resources.

987
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
In order to power the portal device, we will need Waystones.

988
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Each waystone has a tier which will determine the level of the monsters that you will face.

989
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
To go to an area, simply click one that is adjacent to an area that you have already completed.

990
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Insert the waystone and click Traverse.

991
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Portals will open, allowing you and your party to travel to the area you have selected.

992
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:35,000
All the areas in the Endgame feel distinct from the locations in the campaign, and we have dialed the randomization up to 11.

993
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
The monster packs you will face in each map are totally random, and the combination of them can lead to some very interesting combat situations.

994
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
There are over 400 monster types in early access, and they have a lot of varied and interesting abilities.

995
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Depending on which combinations you face, you might find some serious challenges.

996
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,000
In order to cleanse the corruption from the area, you will need to defeat all the powerful rare and unique enemies in it.

997
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Once you have done that, the area will be marked as completed,

998
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and you will be able to travel past it to progress deeper into the world.

999
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
If you die, then the map can no longer be run, and you will have to find another way around to get to the areas behind it.

1000
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
There are also all kinds of other random encounters you might run into as you play maps.

1001
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
One such encounter are Precursor Artifacts.

1002
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
These are ancient, corrupting monuments that irradiate the monsters around them.

1003
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
The monsters that feed off the corruption are drawn to their power.

1004
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
If you defeat the monsters and cleanse the artifact, you will get a powerful temporary buff.

1005
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Some of the buffs make you faster, others rain lightning or fire around you, and some even give you increased experience or help you find better items.

1006
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You can also find Strong Boxes.

1007
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
These enigmatic chests guard piles of treasure, but are always a trap.

1008
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Monsters lie in wait to attack you the moment you open it, and the boxes often have mechanisms to unleash powerful spells or dangerous debuffs.

1009
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,000
There are different types of Strong Boxes containing different items, and you can even use your currency items to craft them on the fly, so you can optimize the content.

1010
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But be careful of opening one you can't handle.

1011
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Sometimes you'll discover monsters frozen in essences.

1012
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Solidified, crystalline corruption.

1013
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
These dangerous monsters can be broken free.

1014
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:28,000
If you defeat them, the essence they drop can be used to upgrade normal items to magic items with a guaranteed mod from a category.

1015
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
For example, we could use this one on some boots to ensure a movement speed mod.

1016
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Rarely, essences will also drop that allow you to upgrade magics to rares, adding the guaranteed mod.

1017
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:59,000
This is incredibly powerful since it allows you to get a second deterministic mod in your crafting projects.

1018
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Combining these with the currencies that are commonly found in Rayclass for modifying items, and we can get a very nice pair of boots indeed.

1019
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Waystones, like all items, can also be crafted using your currency items.

1020
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Adding prefix mods will improve the rewards, while suffix mods increase danger.

1021
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The more dangerous a map is, the more waystones will drop.

1022
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Adding mods to your waystones is key to progressing to higher tiers and sustaining them, but it will require you to take on larger challenges.

1023
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,000
There are a variety of factors you have to consider when crafting your waystones.

1024
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Some maps will have higher density, some lower, some have more magic and rare chests, or monsters, some are more linear, and others more open.

1025
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Make sure you explore and think about what makes certain maps good if you want to maximise your returns.

1026
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:58,000
As you cleanse corruption from higher and higher tiers of the Atlas, you will gain points that you can spend in the Atlas tree.

1027
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
This tree allows you to juice the danger and rewards of all areas in the endgame.

1028
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You could increase the number of monsters, the number of rares, the number of precursor artifacts or strongboxes, even the quantity of item drops.

1029
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:19,000
As you explore the endgame world map, you'll notice various different biomes, from snow-capped mountains to dense jungle valleys.

1030
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Most maps are restricted to certain biomes.

1031
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
As you continue to explore deeper into the Atlas, there are all sorts of things to discover.

1032
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
These cities are constructed by different peoples of Rhaeclast, and have specific items that can be found there.

1033
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
These strange structures marked on the map don't appear to do anything for now.

1034
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Perhaps you'll work out how to use them later.

1035
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:47,000
You might find unique maps like Untainted Paradise, an undisturbed island full of beasts that give an extreme amount of experience.

1036
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
You may even find a lonely man just enjoying his retirement who will give you a unique item for free.

1037
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
In addition, you can find special areas that would make a good spot to set up camp.

1038
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Clear these areas of their hostile inhabitants, and you'll be able to claim them as your own hideout.

1039
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You can decorate your hideout as you see fit, and invite various NPCs to join you there to create your own personal base of options.

1040
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Explorations.

1041
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
A great tool for exploration are towers.

1042
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
These mysterious precursor constructs are dotted around the Atlas.

1043
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Completing the tower will reveal a large area around it, allowing you to scout out your next challenge.

1044
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
There are lots of things to find, so keep looking.

1045
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Some sections of your Atlas are influenced by corruption.

1046
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
This adds extra modifiers to the maps in the region, increasing difficulty and rewards.

1047
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Here, slaying monsters in close proximity to each other will cause the vestiges of corruption within them to merge together, forming powerful and grotesque abominations.

1048
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You may have noticed while looking at the Atlas that some of the areas have these icons above them.

1049
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The icon indicates that the area contains some kind of special encounter.

1050
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
This icon indicates that the area has a powerful boss.

1051
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Because only one in four maps contain a map boss, we are able to make them very powerful and very rewarding.

1052
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:11,000
These bosses come from the campaign, but have had their difficulty increased with changes to AI and some of their abilities.

1053
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's worth noting that because you can see where the bosses are, you can choose to take them on or avoid them.

1054
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
If you do choose to hunt bosses though, then you will be rewarded with special points for the boss hunting section of the Atlas skill tree.

1055
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,000
The points here will allow you to specialise in boss killing, giving you much greater rewards for defeating them.

1056
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:40,000
For each different type of content in the endgame, we are adding specialised trees in order to make it so you don't feel the need to respec your points when you change between different types of content.

1057
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
We will be showing you seven of these by the end of this presentation, so there is still a lot more to come.

1058
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Bosses are not the only icon you will see on the Atlas. Let's take a look at one of the endgame systems, Breach.

1059
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:59,000
If you played PoE 1, you might be familiar with Breach. For PoE 2, we have created sequels to several PoE 1 leagues.

1060
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
While the mechanic is familiar, the monsters, bosses, rewards and progression are all new.

1061
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:14,000
A Breach is a tear in the fabric of reality. Opening it will allow you to see the demons and otherworldly monstrosities that lie in wait on this other plane of existence.

1062
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
By engaging with a Breach, you'll create a bridge between their world and Rayquast.

1063
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
In order to keep the Breach open, you will need to kill the demons that pour forth.

1064
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
The faster you can kill the monsters, the more monsters you will fight and the more loot you will find.

1065
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
You can also find clasped hands that will open and drop more items if you run over them.

1066
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
These can be a good boost to the rewards of the Breach, so keep an eye on them.

1067
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
One of the rewards that you may find while fighting monsters from Breach are Tablets.

1068
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Tablets are special items that can be used with Precursor Towers to add more encounters to the Atlas.

1069
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Breaches will drop Breach Tablets. Clicking on a completed tower will allow you to consume the tablet to add more breaches to areas within range of the tower.

1070
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:07,000
This makes all the content in the Atlas self-sustaining. Want to do more Breaches? Find the tablets, add them to your towers, get more Breaches, getting more tablets.

1071
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Soon your Atlas will be covered in otherworldly domains.

1072
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:19,000
In addition, like all items in PoE, you can craft them. Use your currency to add mods to your tablets, allowing you to upgrade all the Breaches in range.

1073
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Tablets can have up to two mods. These mods do things like adding extra rare monsters, extra clasped hands, or even mods to density of Breaches, allowing you to keep them open longer.

1074
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Often, you will find multiple towers near to each other with overlapping areas of effect. This can allow you to really juice the mechanic by stacking the mods from multiple tablets.

1075
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
In your fight to hold the Breach Demons at bay, you may want to use the powers of their world against them.

1076
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Each endgame mechanic always has player power that can only be gained from that mechanic, and Breach is no different.

1077
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:59,000
In Breach, you will find Catalysts, items that can increase the quality of rings and amulets by improving specific mods.

1078
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,000
You can also find Breach Rings, a special base type that can have its quality improved by Catalysts up to 50%.

1079
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
In this case, you could create a ring with around 170 life.

1080
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Breach Rings can become some of the strongest rings in the game, giving you some good motivation to face the Demon Horns.

1081
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
In addition, each endgame mechanic needs to have a pinnacle endgame encounter.

1082
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
While killing Breach monsters, you may find Breach Splinters.

1083
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Collect enough of these and you'll be able to create a Breach Stone.

1084
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Using a vile technology called the Realm Gate, you can use your Breach Stone to access their domain and bring the fight to them.

1085
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
In this twisted domain, you will find nothing but a single massive Breach.

1086
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Triggering it will reveal hordes of Breach inhabitants.

1087
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:56,000
And should you be fast enough, you will be able to fight their leader, Zest, We That Are One.

1088
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:08,000
We that dreamed, We in nightmare, We that are one.

1089
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Fate relies truth.

1090
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Fawak'd sayendenki be a great hero of Bollywood, now we use Mine.

1091
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:31,000
ALL we're numbered biết in the future are under hierarchies in the game.

1092
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
of PoE too. We won't be showing the rest of them, so you will have to discover them for yourself.

1093
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
But rest assured, this is some of the hardest content we have ever made.

1094
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
All these encounters have specific uniques that can only be found from them.

1095
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
But that's not all. We still have the progression system.

1096
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Defeating Zest will give you points to allocate into the Breach section of the Atlas tree.

1097
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Allocating these points will make Breaches and the Breach domain even harder,

1098
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
but will give you more rewards.

1099
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
The small nodes will increase the difficulty of the Twisted Domain,

1100
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
while the large nodes have more specific bonuses.

1101
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
For example, this node adds more Clasped Hands to your Breaches,

1102
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and adds a pack of Magic Monsters that can guard them.

1103
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Get some more points and you can allocate Waking Nightmare,

1104
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
which will double the number of splinters you get from Clasped Hands,

1105
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
and inflict you with a mysterious debunk.

1106
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
In order to earn more points, you will need to defeat Zest at a higher difficulty,

1107
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,000
and some rewards from Zest can only be found by increasing the difficulty of the Twisted Domain above certain thresholds.

1108
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Defeating Zest at difficulty 4 will be a challenge indeed,

1109
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
but there are many more threats in Wraeclast.

1110
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Ritual Altars are sacrificial sites built by the mysterious King in the Mists.

1111
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:49,000
If you encounter this symbol on the Atlas, then you know that the area contains Ritual Altars.

1112
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Ritual Altars demand tribute.

1113
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Every monster you slaughter in the Circle will feed the altar.

1114
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
After the sacrifice, touch it to begin the ritual.

1115
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
The monsters you just killed will be resurrected by the King of the Mists' dark magic,

1116
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
and you must fight to survive.

1117
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
The tribute you have offered to the altar can be spent to buy powerful items,

1118
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
but they can be expensive.

1119
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
To gain more tribute, you will want to find more altars.

1120
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Each successive ritual you do within an area will spawn the monsters revived by the previous ones,

1121
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
in addition to the ones you sacrificed next to them.

1122
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
By the end of an area, you will be fighting a truly imposing number of foes,

1123
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
but will have a significant amount of tribute to spend.

1124
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
One of the rewards you can buy with tribute are omens.

1125
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
These are special items that allow for metacrafting.

1126
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Crafting items that affect other crafting items.

1127
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Have an item with good prefixes but bad suffixes?

1128
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
This omen will help you to remove the mods you don't want, while keeping the ones you do.

1129
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
There are a bunch more of these with different effects, but we will leave them for you to discover.

1130
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Now don't forget that Ritual will also drop tablets,

1131
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
which can be used to specialize into getting more rituals.

1132
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
If you want to get to the pinnacle boss of Ritual, then you will probably want to use them.

1133
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
They can also be crafted to grant mods, making your rituals more rewarding.

1134
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
The pinnacle encounter of Ritual is the King in the Mists.

1135
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Feared by the Asmiri people, he is said to have brought eternal darkness to the Wildwood.

1136
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
We won't show the encounter, but just like Breach, there are a range of unique items you can get for defeating him,

1137
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and you will gain points in the Ritual section of the Atlas Tree.

1138
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Some maps have been touched by insanity.

1139
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
A mysterious entity has taken a special interest in you.

1140
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Step through the looking glass and you will find your nightmares coming to life.

1141
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
When you touch a mirror, the mists of Delirium will spread out across the area, infecting your mind.

1142
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You must stay within the mist to maintain the nightmare, which is as profitable as it is terrifying.

1143
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Everything you kill will increase the rewards that drop.

1144
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
However, the deeper into the mist you travel, the stronger the monsters are.

1145
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Be careful not to overstay your welcome.

1146
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Rare and unique enemies will become vessels for terrifying demons, who will manifest out of them to unleash powerful attacks on you.

1147
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
The mist also offers a strange crafting material.

1148
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Distilled Emotions.

1149
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
By combining these Emotions, you are able to instill your amulet with a notable from the passive skill tree.

1150
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
This is like gaining an extra passive point for free, attached to your gear.

1151
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
They are also particularly great because you don't have to traverse the tree to get them,

1152
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
allowing you to get off-class bonuses that would normally be much harder to get.

1153
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Distilled Emotions can also be used to instill your endgame maps,

1154
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
applying Delirious to them and adding additional difficulty and rewards,

1155
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
allowing you to further juice your endgame maps.

1156
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
The tablets you can find from Delirium can be used to further improve it,

1157
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
increase pack size, make the fog dissipate slower,

1158
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
or improve your progress towards the pinnacle encounter of Delirium.

1159
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Speaking of which, every now and then you will find Simulacrum Splinters.

1160
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
The mysterious entity will create strange encounters based on warped versions of your own memories.

1161
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Monsters and Simulacrums come in waves that get progressively more difficult.

1162
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
You will receive loot at the end of each wave,

1163
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
and you will have to make the decision to leave now or continue on,

1164
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
facing up against even tougher foes from the mist.

1165
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,000
The bosses you will face as you get deeper into a Simulacrum are truly terrifying.

1166
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,000
If you can complete a Simulacrum, you will gain points for the Delirium section of the Atlas skill tree.

1167
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Next up we have Expedition.

1168
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Occasionally, while clearing Corruption, you will encounter these Kalgurin settlers.

1169
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
The Kalgurins have discovered ancient burial sites with lost Varicium artifacts,

1170
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
and they want you to help dig them up with explosives.

1171
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
The Kalgurins have marked the locations where the relics can be found.

1172
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Place explosives as best you can to dig up as many as possible.

1173
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
There is just one problem.

1174
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Corruption has brought the corpses of their ancestors to life,

1175
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
so you might have to do a little clean up before you can reclaim the artifacts.

1176
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:03,000
You can also find remnants, the destruction of which will further anger the restless dead.

1177
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Each one you blow up will make the subsequent monsters more powerful, but also more rewarding.

1178
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Danig, Rog, Tujan, and Gwennon will exchange the artifacts for useful items and runic magic.

1179
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You can also find tablets to increase the number of expeditions and the rewards.

1180
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
This one increases the radius of explosives, while this one increases the number of remnants you will find.

1181
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Eventually, you might discover a logbook.

1182
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
These are special maps full of buried treasure and relics.

1183
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Essentially one giant dig site.

1184
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Here you can create an extremely long chain of explosives and go through a very high number of remnants.

1185
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
But be careful!

1186
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Many remnants have mods that can really break your build,

1187
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
so you will probably want to avoid these ones.

1188
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
If you add too many remnants, you could easily make the encounter harder than you can handle.

1189
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
There are all sorts of interesting things buried under the ground in logbooks.

1190
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
You might find dripping caves and hidden pirate caches.

1191
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,000
But the most powerful encounter is Ulroth, the ancient undead commander of the Knights of the Sun.

1192
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Defeating him will grant you unique rewards,

1193
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
as well as points to spend in the expedition section of the Atlas Tree.

1194
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So those are the endgame systems on the Atlas, but we are not done yet.

1195
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
The trials we talked about earlier have much more content when you get to endgame too.

1196
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Just like the other endgame systems, they also have progression mechanics, unique rewards,

1197
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
and player power that can only be gained from them.

1198
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,000
As you get higher level coins for the trial of the Sekimers, you will unlock more floors to explore.

1199
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Each floor has its own challenging brooms and a floor boss that you will need to kill.

1200
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
There are four floors in total, leading to another pinnacle boss at the end of the last floor,

1201
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
which can only be accessed at endgame.

1202
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
The trial of the Sekimers is where you'll find duels, which you can socket into your tree.

1203
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
These are like passives that you can craft with your currency items.

1204
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,000
They can be really powerful, as they allow you to stack modifiers that may not be easily accessible on the tree normally.

1205
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
This duel gives lightning damage and shock chance, for example.

1206
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
There are quite a few duel sockets on the tree, so it's possible to gain a lot of power here.

1207
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
There are also other types of duels that don't provide any bonuses themselves, but affect other passives surrounding them.

1208
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,000
This duel increases the effect of small nodes and radius by 25%.

1209
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
With careful placement in the tree, you could get a significant amount of power from it.

1210
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:40,000
There are also unique duels available with very interesting effects, but you will have to find those for yourself.

1211
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:48,000
In order to push further into the trial and uncover the secrets of the Marakev, you will want to take advantage of its progression system, relics.

1212
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Relics are items that can be placed in the Relic Altar as you start the trial.

1213
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
They give special bonuses that affect the trial, making it easier and increasing its rewards.

1214
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Of course, you can craft these with your currency items, making them even stronger.

1215
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:09,000
If you can complete the entire trial overcoming all four flaws, the final boss will reward you with one of many unique relics.

1216
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:15,000
These relics will be consumed when used on your next run, but can reward you with unique and powerful items.

1217
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
For example, this is The Last Flame.

1218
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
If you use it, you will have only one honour for the entire trial, so you will need to do a completely hitless run.

1219
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,000
The Trial of Chaos also extends into the endgame.

1220
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
As you gain inscribed ultimatums of higher and higher levels, the number of chambers that you can go through increases.

1221
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:42,000
In true Vaal style, this allows you to take even more risks for even more rewards.

1222
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
At endgame, you can progress through up to ten chambers with three bosses on a single run.

1223
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Stacking ten tribulations on top of each other will make this a significant challenge, but it's worth it.

1224
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
The Trial Master will tempt you with items of the Vaal Empire, such as Vaal Orbs.

1225
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Vaal Orbs are powerful crafting items that corrupt your gear with random mysterious outcomes.

1226
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Corruption prevents an item from being modified further, so it has to be the last step of your craft, but it's also the most impactful one.

1227
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:18,000
For example, if you use one on your body armour, it might add a new powerful enchantment, or it might reroll up to half of its modifiers.

1228
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Vaal Orbs also have the ability to add a socket, allowing you to bypass the normal restriction of how many sockets an item can have.

1229
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
A body armour could get up to three sockets this way, allowing for a significant number of mods.

1230
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Vaal Orbs can even modify uniques.

1231
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Adding enchantments or sockets to uniques can make them incredibly powerful, but there is a good chance that you will break them as well.

1232
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
The Trial Master will also occasionally offer you Soul Cores.

1233
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Originally formed by Chaos, the Vaal sought to replicate Soul Cores through human sacrifice rituals and blood magic to power their civilisation.

1234
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Soul Cores are powerful socketable items, with mods that cannot be obtained from regular runes.

1235
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Like all endgame content, there is of course a pinnacle boss.

1236
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
The final chamber will drop keys to this mysterious door.

1237
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Some say this is where the Trial Master himself resides.

1238
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Perhaps you are willing to take the risk to find out.

1239
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Had enough yet?

1240
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Because there is still just one more thing.

1241
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
The most difficult content in Path of Exile 2.

1242
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:29,000
While mapping, you might come across this fortress that has emerged from underground, surrounded by an enormous maze riddled with danger.

1243
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Is the maze preventing something from getting in? Or something getting out?

1244
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:41,000
This fortress is of ancient origin, and its construction has similarities to the towers and tablets that you have been using on your journey through the endgame.

1245
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It is clear from the entrance that there are three keys required to enter.

1246
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Local factions are vying for access to the fortress in order to seize the power they believe will be inside.

1247
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Each of the faction's leaders have managed to get their hands on one of the keys, so you will need to defeat them.

1248
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Each faction is led by an Uber Act boss.

1249
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:05,000
You can see one of them inhabiting this city, but in order to fight him, you will first need to defeat their two lieutenants in the adjacent zones.

1250
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Be careful.

1251
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,000
If you fail against either of the lieutenants, or to kill the leader, they will move on, and you will need to find them again.

1252
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Kill all the Uber bosses and you will gain access to the fortress.

1253
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
We aren't going to spoil it, as we can't wait to see you guys attempt it for the first time.

1254
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
But is there a tree you get points in after killing it?

1255
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Of course there is.

1256
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
This is Path of Exile. There is always another tree.

1257
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So these are your challenges for PoE 2.

1258
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
As you can see, this project is crazy huge.

1259
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Way bigger than even we expected when we started out.

1260
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
But how do you gain access?

1261
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Well, during early access you'll need a key to get in.

1262
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:45,000
To thank our existing PoE supporters who have spent more than $480 US dollars, we'll be giving you guys a key for the PC version for free.

1263
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Anyone else who wants one can get one by purchasing one of the new early access supporter packs that have just been released to the store.

1264
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:58,000
If you just want early access to PoE 2, then you can get a key in the $30 US dollar early access pack.

1265
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
The pack also comes with $30 of points to spend in the MTX store.

1266
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:10,000
But we also have a variety of other supporter packs filled with exclusive microtransactions, points to spend in the store, and even physical items.

1267
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,000
The cosmetics can be used right now in PoE 1 and in Path of Exile 2 when early access starts.

1268
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Most of this footage has been recorded in Path of Exile 1, since that's where you can use them immediately.

1269
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
The Lord of Ogham supporter pack contains a cosmetic armour set befitting of the Count of Ogham himself.

1270
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
There is also a matching back attachment which has an alternate variant depicting the influence of corruption.

1271
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Also in this pack you can find a portal formed of the rusted armour of the fallen soldiers in the Red Veil of Ogham.

1272
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
And the offspring of a vicious crowbell boss found in the hunting grounds.

1273
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
This one doesn't look so vicious though.

1274
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:55,000
On top of that you'll receive the Iron Counts Zwei-Hander to apply to your one-handed or two-handed swords.

1275
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
For those who are wanting to decorate your hideouts with fond memories and tales of Path of Exile's history,

1276
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
you will also get a series of hideout statues.

1277
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
This pack contains the statue of Hillock.

1278
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:11,000
For Path of Exile 1's closed beta, each pack contained a true New Zealand icon, the Kiwi.

1279
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Following this tradition, all packs in this series will also contain a new themed Kiwi pet.

1280
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
The pet will loyally follow you into battle, but run away at the first sign of trouble.

1281
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Become the ruler of the desert with the King of the Farad'n supporter pack.

1282
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Show your mastery of traversing the sands of the Vasteri plains.

1283
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
The body armour will allow you to glide along the ground with ancient sand magic.

1284
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Now each armour set comes with body armour, boots, gloves and helmet.

1285
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
But the boots are covered in sand.

1286
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
If you'd prefer to show them off, you can turn the gliding off if you want.

1287
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
The accompanying back attachment equips you with two powerful pillars that can control and manipulate lightning.

1288
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
They will periodically release their energy in a powerful blast while in town,

1289
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
and hover in a circle around you, arcing lightning between them forming a barrier of energy.

1290
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Replace the appearance of any bow with the Farad'n's Glory skin.

1291
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Or replace the appearance of a spear with the Tyranny's End spear skin.

1292
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
This spear skin can be applied to staves and war staves in Path of Exile 1.

1293
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:24,000
If you want to truly show your worth as a King of the Farad'n, then you definitely need your trusty, moving entire city fortress known as the Dreadnaught to travel across the Vasteri plains.

1294
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
In Path of Exile you can decorate your hideout however you like, and it's no exception here.

1295
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
It comes with a variety of thematic elements to use, or use decorations from elsewhere in the game.

1296
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Additionally, you will get the Deshret's Blessing level up effect.

1297
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
The King of the Farad'n Kiwi pet.

1298
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And last but not least, a statue depicting the Vile Oversoul from Path of Exile 1.

1299
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:59,000
For those who don't know how supporter packs work, each pack comes with all of the cosmetics from the previous tier, so you will get all the items from the Lord of Ogham supporter pack as well.

1300
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:08,000
The Thaumaturge of the Vile supporter pack features an armour set and back attachment themed around the Vile and their pursuit of science and progress.

1301
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:16,000
You can find the Soulcore weapon effect in this pack, which causes Thaumaturgic energy harnessed from Sacrifice to spill from your weapon.

1302
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
This pack also contains Dooyani's Idol.

1303
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:27,000
It replaces the default appearance of any foci to an ancient relic once used by Dooyani, and this can be applied to shields in Path of Exile 1.

1304
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
That's not the only Vile weapon you'll find. It also contains the Wand of the Thaumaturge skin.

1305
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And the Royal Sacrifice dagger skin.

1306
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
You wouldn't think to put sacrificial gems on a Kiwi, but the Vile did.

1307
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Thaumaturge of the Vile supporters will receive the Thaumaturge of the Vile Kiwi pet.

1308
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And the Statue of Dominus. This is also the first pack in the series with a physical item.

1309
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
When purchasing this pack, you'll receive a Path of Exile 2 logo t-shirt.

1310
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But if you don't want one, you can opt out and return for additional points to spend in the store.

1311
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Becoming a Warlord of the Kaorui supporter will grant you an armor set and back attachment, adorned in jade carvings and iridescent feathers resembling power.

1312
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Enough to even impress the Ancestral Gods, specifically Tukuhama, the Kaorui God of War.

1313
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Overkill, you say? I think the Kaorui people would disagree.

1314
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Why not drop a gigantic totem on rare enemies you slay to crush them to a pulp?

1315
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Replace your crafting bench in your hideout with the Ancestral Canoe crafting bench,

1316
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:37,000
where Ancestral Chief Mata will summon a giant canoe manned by Kaorui warriors to aid in your crafting desires.

1317
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
We must all start somewhere.

1318
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
You'll also get a pair of weapon skins.

1319
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Equip Akoya's Felling Axe skin to your one-hand or two-handed axes,

1320
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
or Tukuhama's Crusher to your one-handed or two-handed maces.

1321
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:58,000
A true Kaorui warlord is always accompanied by their trusty Kiwi.

1322
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Equipped with armor and harnessing Ancestral Magic, they make the perfect sidekick.

1323
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Once one of the most feared beings in Wraeclast, Malachi was slain by a powerful exile.

1324
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
May the statue commemorate the virtue of exile's past, present and of the future.

1325
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Of course, it's not all about dressing up in game.

1326
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
You'll want to look good in real life too.

1327
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
By becoming a Warlord of the Kaorui supporter, you'll also get a Path of Exile 2 hoodie.

1328
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Our final tier of supporter pack in this series is the Liberator of Wraeclast supporter pack.

1329
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
The Liberator of Wraeclast armor set and back attachment come made with the finest materials in Wraeclast,

1330
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
and shattered glass mosaics suspended in divine power.

1331
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Set up your base of operations in the Beacon of Salvation hideout.

1332
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Why restrict yourself to just one island when you can liberate more?

1333
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:54,000
The Beacon of Salvation hideout comes equipped with your own collection of small islands and personal operators of boats that you can use to row between them.

1334
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Just walk to the piers, click a boat to enter and navigate as you choose.

1335
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Decorate each island as you see fit to best represent your well-earned hideout.

1336
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Everyone in your hideout can use their own boat. Why not have some racers?

1337
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You can also get the Window to Twilight portal effect.

1338
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,000
A beautiful mosaic piece of art that shatters and reveals a gateway to your desired destination as you approach it.

1339
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
As you walk away, the glass magically reforms back to its original form.

1340
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Rule in style with the Throne of the Ruler map device.

1341
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Sure, this map device can create portals to endgame maps, but it also comes with a throne you can sit on to oversee your growing kingdom.

1342
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Look down on the plebeians running your maps.

1343
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Being the Liberator though is not just about sitting in your throne all day.

1344
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
If you do decide to join the fight yourself, you can leave a High Priest in charge as your second in command.

1345
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Liberator of Rhaeclast supporters will also get a set of varied weapon skins.

1346
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
The Light of Divinity Scepter skin.

1347
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
The Deliverance Crossbow skin.

1348
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
The Justice Flail skin.

1349
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And the Redemption Shield skin.

1350
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Once again, you'll have an Accompany in Kiwi, and of course a statue depicting one of the most iconic events in Rhaeclast's history.

1351
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
The battle between a powerful exile and Kitava, the Insatiable.

1352
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
With the help of two deities, Sin and Innocence, the exile was able to defeat him once and for all.

1353
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
This supporter pack also contains the Path of Exile 2 art book.

1354
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:29,000
This 215 page full colour art book includes a huge amount of amazing concept art and lore, produced during the long and exciting journey of Path of Exile 2's development.

1355
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And finally, Path of Exile has a tradition of letting the community participate in designing game features.

1356
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
For Path of Exile 2 we'll be adding the Twilight Order foil reliquary.

1357
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:51,000
By becoming a Liberator of Rhaeclast supporter, once Path of Exile 2 is released, you will be able to select any unique item you have found, and be able to drop it from the reliquary.

1358
01:21:51,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Once players have submitted their items, keys to the reliquary will start dropping, and other players will be able to find foil versions of uniques that you have submitted along with a message for the lucky player.

1359
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,000
The more players submit the same unique, the more chances there will be for the reliquary to drop them, so choose wisely.

1360
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Now almost all of these items are available to use in PoE 1 right now.

1361
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
There are a few exceptions where the item class clearly doesn't exist, such as crossbows or flails.

1362
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
And there are also a few microtransactions on weapon types that are unavailable in PoE 2 at the start of Early Access.

1363
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Once classes that use those weapon types are added, those microtransactions will be available to use.

1364
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:33,000
If you can't decide which supporter pack to choose yet, you can always start with the Early Access Supporter Pack, that just includes a key and some points to spend in the store.

1365
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Then you can upgrade to any of the following tiers at a later date.

1366
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
These Supporter Packs will be available for purchase throughout Early Access.

1367
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
We'd really like to thank you for your ongoing support. Without you guys, Path of Exile 2 could not have happened.

1368
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Now, I'm sure you guys have a lot of questions. Stick around, because coming up next, we have a live Q&A with Ziggy D.

1369
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
We'll see you next time.

1370
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
We'll see you next time.

1371
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
We'll see you next time.

1372
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
We'll see you next time.

1373
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
We'll see you next time.

1374
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:21,000
To the post-show discussion and Q&A. I hope you all enjoyed what you've seen so far.

1375
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:29,000
It's been pretty exciting for us here as well, as you guys have been inspired already just watching things and already cooking a new ascendancy class.

1376
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yeah, for sure.

1377
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
You've got to do design whenever you can.

1378
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Absolutely.

1379
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
There's been a few fun moments here already.

1380
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,000
But I'm your host, Ziggy D, and I'm joined by Jonathan and Mark to talk about everything you've seen.

1381
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Honestly, it's so much.

1382
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I mean, we were really keen to make sure that when we went into Early Access that people didn't feel like it was just, you know, limping along and kind of, you know, just like a minimal amount of content.

1383
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
We really wanted to kind of blow people away.

1384
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
So hopefully people feel like, yeah, there is enough content.

1385
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Because, yeah, it was certainly a mission to get all that stuff in.

1386
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Yeah, I did come here expecting that there would be, you know, maybe a basic mapping placeholder endgame and your three acts and, you know, the half the classes.

1387
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
But you've made a decision here, clearly, that's got to go to the core POE player community in mind.

1388
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Absolutely.

1389
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
So, I mean, we have to make sure.

1390
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Like, I mean, look, Path of Exile's endgame is kind of known for the fact that you get to choose between different types of content and that, like, you know, some people enjoy one thing, some people enjoy another.

1391
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And I feel like that choice is like a huge part of what makes it good.

1392
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
So if we didn't have that when we entered endgame, then I don't think that would be, you know, like, that wouldn't be a Path of Exile endgame.

1393
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
So that's kind of what we have to make sure of.

1394
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:49,000
So we kind of said, okay, well, like, what is the minimum number of, like, different endgame things you need to be able to have in order to be able to actually have a viable endgame that you feel like you get different choices?

1395
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And that's how we ended up with what we have here.

1396
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I definitely feel like a lot of games nowadays release, you know, and their campaigns intact real good.

1397
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
You get to the endgame and it just falls real flat.

1398
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Yeah.

1399
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And it was certainly a very important moment for us when we were like, hold on, that's the wrong thing to do.

1400
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Like, let's not make the same mistake as everyone else.

1401
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Let's pivot.

1402
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And we actually did that.

1403
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And like, it made a world of difference and made the game all of a sudden, you know, a hundred times bigger with an infinite amount more content.

1404
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Right.

1405
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
It was definitely hard, though, because like, okay, like, so we're, you know, we're progressing.

1406
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
It's like we would have, we would have made it.

1407
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
We would have gotten, you know, all these acts in if we hadn't have changed direction.

1408
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
It's like to actually say, you know what, we're going to specifically not finish this content.

1409
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
We'll be working on, you know, that we, that we, that we, you know, it's like pins down everyone.

1410
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
We're stopping work on this.

1411
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
We're going to move over to end games.

1412
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
It's actually more important.

1413
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Like that was certainly a hard one.

1414
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
That would have been some whiplash there.

1415
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I imagine.

1416
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I mean, it's like suddenly the whole, you know, like environment art team.

1417
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It's like, you know, they were just like, whatever you're working on, just scrap, you don't want to scrap, but you know, just stop it.

1418
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
We're doing something else now.

1419
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So saving clothes.

1420
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Yeah.

1421
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And for a lot of the developers, cause you got to also think like a lot of our developers have just been working on this campaign for what is it now?

1422
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Six years.

1423
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I think it's even longer.

1424
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Yeah.

1425
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It's like, it's just this epic journey.

1426
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Whereas none of them, you know, a lot of these people haven't been working on path of Excel one this whole time where, so some of us are like, you know, we're just churning out in game with every league and doing all of that.

1427
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:20,000
But for a lot of these people, a lot of these developers, yeah, it was quite jarring to swap over, but everyone embraced it.

1428
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
You know, we talked about it.

1429
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Everyone was happy about it and stoked about it.

1430
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And it just ended up coming out real awesome.

1431
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
So I think it's landed well.

1432
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And it definitely kind of blew me away when you, even before I saw anything, we were in the car on the drive here and you were just info dumping all of the end game.

1433
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
You're like, Oh, we've got this feature.

1434
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
We've got this feature.

1435
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I'm getting dopamine just from hearing about it.

1436
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I haven't even seen anything yet.

1437
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
But do you guys feel like you're competing against yourselves a little bit here?

1438
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Because path of Exiles kind of set the bar.

1439
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
The original game has set the bar for what is available to end game in a game like this.

1440
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And it makes it's not acceptable really to launch with just nothing in terms of end game now.

1441
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Absolutely.

1442
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I mean, yeah, I mean, like if you're not competing with yourself, then I don't think you're going to make good progress.

1443
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Right. So that's what you really have to do.

1444
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Yeah. But cracking that out for beta even.

1445
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Yep. Absolutely.

1446
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I just think it would not have landed nearly as well without that.

1447
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
And I think it's important that our existing Path of Exile 1 community feels like they're also served.

1448
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Like, yeah, sure.

1449
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
We're doing all this stuff for new players and that's really important and that'll expand the audience.

1450
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
But, you know, if we launched and all the PeeWee 1 players are unhappy, that wouldn't be good.

1451
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Yeah.

1452
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:33,000
So, you know, we have to make sure that they also feel like, you know, they've got a game for both them and for all the new players we hope to bring to the genre.

1453
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
And you definitely want all those different axes as well.

1454
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Like just having two, right?

1455
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
You'll get a lot of a lot of content can be immediately divisive.

1456
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Right.

1457
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Obviously, that's the nature of it.

1458
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
That's how it goes.

1459
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Right.

1460
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,000
And so you have all of these different avenues because there are different players who like different types of content.

1461
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Yeah.

1462
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And if there's your one end game system, well, immediately then there is a portion of players who are just like, I don't want this.

1463
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Right.

1464
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And so having all of these options is like ultra key.

1465
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And that is what Path of Exile 1 has taught us.

1466
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,000
And again, it's like, I'd say lessons learned, you know, for the genre and it is expanding and other games and stuff.

1467
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
But yeah, certainly, as you said, competing with ourselves.

1468
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yes.

1469
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:21,000
And it has like, you know, 40 axes, you know, and we've got seven really good ones here and obviously more to come.

1470
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
But seven is a lot, mind you.

1471
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Especially when it's all like, you know, like people have to learn a lot of things again.

1472
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Yeah.

1473
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
It's going to be very interesting to see how long it takes people to do the kind of difficulty for Pinnacle content.

1474
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1475
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:40,000
It's like we have to, you know, we have to, it's honestly like we actually don't even really know because like you never know what people are going to find in terms of builds and so on.

1476
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Like, I'm hoping that it will take people a while to be able to work it out.

1477
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
But, you know, you never know.

1478
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Maybe end of day one, people just like, oh, yeah, easy.

1479
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
No problem, mate.

1480
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
You know, it could be what it's like.

1481
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
A few people that are doing that sort of thing.

1482
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I saw like a solo cell phone level 100 in 24 hours or something.

1483
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Jeez.

1484
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Okay.

1485
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
This is where we've got it now, is it?

1486
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
So I imagine there'll be a little bit of a soft reset there for people.

1487
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Yeah, for sure.

1488
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
A relearning period.

1489
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
There's stuff to learn.

1490
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And I mean, PeeWee 2 has changed a lot over the years.

1491
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
More than five years of development now.

1492
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And what was that initial pitch when PeeWee 2 was first put forward as to what it's going

1493
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
to be?

1494
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Because it was much smaller in scope originally.

1495
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Yeah.

1496
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
So when we started, it wasn't even a sequel.

1497
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
It was just, we're just updating the character ricks.

1498
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And over time, it kind of feature creeped into a proper sequel.

1499
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
But the thing that we were saying is whenever we were talking about it, and I guess this

1500
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:35,000
is the main thing, is that we're like, okay, when we make an area here, it needs to be that

1501
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
there's like a theme for it.

1502
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
And whenever it feels unique from everything else, we're not going to just like have recycled

1503
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
stuff like within the campaign that just feels like, oh, you know, we just took this area

1504
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
and modified it slightly.

1505
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Each one's got to have its own stuff.

1506
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
It's got to have monsters that were like carefully thought about that like, you know, fit in

1507
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
with the world.

1508
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And it's got to have bosses that are actually like good tier quality.

1509
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
You know, every area is going to have one.

1510
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:01,000
And so those decisions has kind of been things that have meant that like they really raise

1511
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
the quality bar to a level that took us way longer than we even really expected.

1512
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Like the, those things there just like they, it's huge, right?

1513
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Like, honestly, I feel like we underestimated significantly what it would take to deliver

1514
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
that level of quality.

1515
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I remember really early on a battle I fought for.

1516
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,000
And I mean, like way back was like, if you think back to say Diablo 2, which obviously

1517
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
still holds a lot of, you know, power in terms of design motivations and philosophy and stuff

1518
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
within the company, you get things like the super uniques and POE one did them.

1519
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
And it's just like, here's a boss with one or two skills.

1520
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:41,000
And I remember very, very, very early on in POE two, I'm like, I want every single boss

1521
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
to be memorable and a thing.

1522
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
I don't want a unique monster.

1523
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,000
That's just like dies in two seconds and uses heavy strike and has a fancy name.

1524
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And I remember, I even got some push back at the time and thinking like, you know, I love

1525
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
the bosses, my favorite part of everything.

1526
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
And so I was just like, man, I really, I don't want this.

1527
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
This is just terrible.

1528
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And, but of course that decision, me pushing for that, me wanting that turned into this

1529
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
megalithic.

1530
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Now we have 50 aiming to be a hundred, honestly, probably later, several more hundred once

1531
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
all the end games, everything start to evolve and more expansions comes out.

1532
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And I'm like, yep, we maybe just made, you know, a hundred times more work for ourselves,

1533
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:33,000
but a hundred percent bloody worthwhile because I'd say those bosses are one of the main, you

1534
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
know, attraction pieces of the game.

1535
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
And anyone who plays it is just like, holy crap, those boss fights are amazing.

1536
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
So like, you know, obviously some are bad and some are good to different people and all

1537
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
that.

1538
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
That's how it all goes.

1539
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
That's part of all the fun.

1540
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
But it is true that me pushing for that thing literally created thousands and thousands and

1541
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,000
thousands of hours of work.

1542
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Now worthwhile work, but it is again, that exact thing of like, the scope was kind of

1543
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
small on numerous axes.

1544
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And as we just raised it and raised the quality bar to what we thought was good.

1545
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Um, it certainly went from, you know, what was it initially just reskinning some character

1546
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
classes and new rigs or whatever into this like mega scale entire campaign.

1547
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Yeah.

1548
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Everything, but full standalone, separate game.

1549
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah.

1550
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
One other anecdote since we went out of that territory, it was originally code named project

1551
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Chimera.

1552
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
What?

1553
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I don't, I, I, that was, it was this pipe dream.

1554
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I've never been a fan of these code names.

1555
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
It was just like, there were times way back in the original office.

1556
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It was all this, like, sometimes there'll be a feature you can't really do in P.O.E.

1557
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
1.

1558
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And it was always like, ah, we'll do it in project Chimera.

1559
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
That was like amongst the developers.

1560
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
And people were like, what the heck is that?

1561
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Now, ironically, um, there is a boss, uh, in act three called, well, it's got a different

1562
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
name, but it's called the Chimera internally.

1563
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
It is a Chimera.

1564
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
It's a multi-headed beast.

1565
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
And you've seen in a few of the, um, marketing, you know, things here and here, different trailers,

1566
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
little snippets of it.

1567
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Um, and I think it's just ironic that that, that was actually the first boss asset made

1568
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,000
before everything, the first monster, because back in when we used to just make random monsters

1569
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
and we'll find out how to use them.

1570
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
And that was made for that game.

1571
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
It was used in the original P.O.E. 2 trailer.

1572
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Right.

1573
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
It is the only incomplete technically, but only from a balance.

1574
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Or was the last boss to finish in the entire path of Exile.

1575
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,000
It sounds like there was like some sort of emotional demon that you had to battle there.

1576
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Like the legacy of the original idea.

1577
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And you had to finish it.

1578
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
We had a moment with the monster game designers where we're like, oh my God, it's happening.

1579
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
The Chimera is finally being finished.

1580
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Holy.

1581
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
This is like, yeah, we were effectively like, we need to celebrate this boss finally being

1582
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
done.

1583
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
It was like at the origin.

1584
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And now it's at this, you know, point where we're about to deploy early access, you know,

1585
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
not to say the end, because there is, the end is forever away.

1586
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Yeah.

1587
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Yeah.

1588
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
It's still the beginning of a journey in many ways.

1589
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Yep.

1590
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
But on that note of celebrating, like, how do you guys feel having now kind of, for the

1591
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,000
first time, I feel really like laid bare kind of everything you have, you're putting

1592
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
it out there and only being two weeks away from everyone playing it.

1593
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Well, it's always scary, you know, coming into a release.

1594
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
And I think especially for, you know, there's like a bunch of people on the PeeWee 2 team

1595
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
who have, you know, like they have, this is their first game that they're going to be

1596
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
releasing.

1597
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
And that experience is something that, you know, like, yeah, like it's tough.

1598
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:26,000
And honestly, I think that even we were feeling a little bit cocky actually about the fact

1599
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
because, you know, we release, you know, content for PeeWee 1 all the time.

1600
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
And I feel like we kind of felt like we knew what it took to get a game released.

1601
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
But honestly, like PeeWee 2 was just a whole entirely different demon as far as getting

1602
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
things out, right?

1603
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Like, it's just way more difficult.

1604
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Like when you actually have to make everything, like the whole frickin' thing right from the

1605
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
ground up again, it's like, wow, there's way more stuff there.

1606
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
And like, there's even things like the passive tree where it's like, I feel like we underestimated

1607
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
what it would take to get something like that to an actual releasable state.

1608
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Like, that was a huge amount of work.

1609
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Just like absolutely colossal to get it to, you know, to get that kind of stuff in shape.

1610
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Like, it's just been crazy.

1611
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:11,000
So, yeah, like, obviously it's nerve wracking, you know, coming up to a release day.

1612
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
But I think we do have something that players are going to really enjoy.

1613
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And, you know, like, it's always comforting when, you know, I mean, we had a live event

1614
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
in LA recently, you know, people, you know, we got to the time limit and everyone's like,

1615
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
oh man, we don't want to stop, you know.

1616
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
So, like, I'm really, I think people are going to really enjoy it.

1617
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
It's been a whole different experience for me here playing this time around as well.

1618
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Whereas before I was playing a very buggy kind of internal version of the game that was

1619
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
very experimental.

1620
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Now playing, you know, almost what I'm going to be playing.

1621
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Well, I heard you still managed to blow the count up the elevator with some kind of knockback bugs.

1622
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I wasn't going to mention that.

1623
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Yeah, we have to say, we have to just go with that word.

1624
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I did send the Act 1 boss up an elevator with knockback.

1625
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
It was good.

1626
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Intended mechanic.

1627
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
I thought it was pretty funny.

1628
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
He was in his like big wolf form and kind of trapped in there.

1629
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
So just barking at me through the wood.

1630
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
It's good.

1631
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
So if you feel a lot, I'm sure there's a few things to work out over this next two weeks.

1632
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I hope the team can have a little bit of a rest for a day before they get back into it.

1633
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Yeah.

1634
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It's been a lot.

1635
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,000
So you've done that pivot to the end game focus and got so much for us now to play around

1636
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
with in the beta.

1637
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
And it seems like originally I was thinking, you know, we might be playing for a few weeks

1638
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
here and then, you know, maybe going back over to some part of Exile 1 stuff.

1639
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
But it seems like you guys want us playing through Christmas.

1640
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
That would certainly be good.

1641
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I mean, look, there's enough stuff there.

1642
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I think it will take people a long time to get through.

1643
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah.

1644
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And I mean, obviously, it's also going to be the first time people playing through a completely

1645
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
fresh campaign as well.

1646
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I think that will take people a fair amount of time.

1647
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
So, yeah, there's.

1648
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
And then, of course, the end game as well to explore.

1649
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I mean, yeah, it should be pretty significant.

1650
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I mean, we've always wanted it to be that Path of Exile 2 leagues, you know, are going

1651
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
to be, you know, like how PvE 1 leagues are.

1652
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Where you play them and you play them for, like, you know, a reasonable amount of time.

1653
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Yeah.

1654
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And then, you know, sure, you get done with them eventually and then you've got the next

1655
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
content that comes out.

1656
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
So, yeah, in order to be able to realize that, you have to have enough of a base to make

1657
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
that happen.

1658
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Yeah.

1659
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
People are definitely wondering, like, how invested they can get in the beta.

1660
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
So I definitely want to ask a few questions kind of around that idea.

1661
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:14,000
So, firstly, is there going to be wipes and resets and will there be something before

1662
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
launch as well?

1663
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
So we are going to be having new, like, leagues effectively throughout the beta whenever we

1664
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
launch something significant.

1665
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Because, you know, we want to make sure that all of the, you know, effectively that people

1666
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
are able to play through.

1667
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
But that stuff will be merged into an early access league.

1668
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
And effectively, after we go into full release, that league will stick around.

1669
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Now, I can't promise that everything about your character will function exactly like how

1670
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
it did in that thing.

1671
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Surely not.

1672
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I imagine it will be a glorious kind of snapshot of all of the broken stuff I have.

1673
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Yeah, here's all the broken stuff.

1674
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
But effectively, we can contain all that stuff in the sort of early access league.

1675
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And then if you still want to play those characters, you know, like, then you can go right ahead

1676
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
and do that.

1677
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
But, you know, the action is always going to be in whatever the most recent league is.

1678
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
And then, of course, after that point, there'll be a standard that everything goes into, which,

1679
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,000
you know, all our economic sins will forever more be archived in standard.

1680
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
So, yeah, that's, you know, no doubt what will happen.

1681
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
It's nice that it's not going to be affecting what will be the standard league.

1682
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1683
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
That's the idea.

1684
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Also that people will be able to kind of get invested in their characters.

1685
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1686
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I mean, there's even something kind of cool about the idea of making something that will

1687
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
be like that little historical piece.

1688
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Absolutely.

1689
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
A little collectible.

1690
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Absolutely.

1691
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
And I'm sure there'll be some handful of legacy things that only exist in early access

1692
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
leagues.

1693
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So, you know, I guess we'll have to see what comes of the unique balance.

1694
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
You talked about like the, you know, playing for a week or how long are we expecting?

1695
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Well, we sort of remember and a lot of the, you know, a lot of the P.O.E.1 players,

1696
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
we've thinking very differently to people who are obviously going to experience this

1697
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
as a new game, but it is a new game, right?

1698
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,000
You don't have all these predefined, hyper refined builds to play to immediately, you

1699
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
know, go through things.

1700
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:50,000
You don't have people coming in with like fully detailed 7 million line, but with build

1701
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
guides of exactly what to do with what items.

1702
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
The discovery is going to be there.

1703
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
The discovery takes time and the discovery is like honestly ultra fun for me.

1704
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I love it.

1705
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Yeah.

1706
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Now those things will emerge after time.

1707
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Of course they do completely fine.

1708
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
But you should remember like there's a lot of game to play here to discover, to learn,

1709
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:12,000
learn about the world, the new narratives, the new world building, the new unique items,

1710
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,000
the ascendancy classes, the massive passive tree, which is bigger than P.O.E.1s.

1711
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:24,000
The, like, you know, end game systems, the bosses, that like, it's, it's not going to be this

1712
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
like, you know, even, you know, I personally, when I appear we won league comes out, for example,

1713
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I play for like a month, sometimes a bit longer, sometimes a bit less.

1714
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
It ultimately also depends largely what's going on here and how much I need to invest here.

1715
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
So, you know, and there are other people who play for more like three and whatnot, but there's

1716
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
certainly going to be a much longer time period you can play this for while still discovering

1717
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
new stuff and not feel like you're finished.

1718
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
You know what I mean?

1719
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Yeah.

1720
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I mean, I don't know if you see that subjective, everyone can pick their own point when they

1721
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
finish, but if you want to see everything and do everything, you're going to be investing

1722
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
a lot more time, especially these first time rounds.

1723
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
And then obviously with every league, there's more to discover, but you get faster at doing

1724
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
all these parts over and over and over again.

1725
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
You'll get more efficient over time.

1726
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
That's how the game works.

1727
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:10,000
So yeah, I would expect a lot of time to be sunk into this to fully explore it to start

1728
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,000
with like a lot, you know, not a week, not two weeks.

1729
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
You're going to be going far, far longer than that if you want to see everything.

1730
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
You know, it's up to you.

1731
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Play at your own pace.

1732
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
See how you want to go.

1733
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Learn at your own pace.

1734
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
That's the beauty of a new game as well, which we haven't been able to experience with

1735
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Path of Exile 1, you know, or other games for so long is actually discovering the entire

1736
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
world.

1737
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
And yeah, there's some familiar mechanics at the end game and stuff like that, which is

1738
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
awesome for people.

1739
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Yeah, I certainly want to really, I'm very excited to see people discovering the new

1740
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
things and getting so excited about it.

1741
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I can tell you're amped for watching people go through that discovery process.

1742
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
I'm maybe even diving at yourself a bit.

1743
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
100%.

1744
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I mean, I love sitting there in Path of Building as many of us do, but I am very excited for

1745
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
that.

1746
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
That new discovery process for a while.

1747
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I think you were saying how much you were part spreadsheet.

1748
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I think I'm like, I think I was saying I'm like maybe 60% spreadsheet, 40% discovery

1749
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
and there's my play archetype.

1750
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
You know, so.

1751
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Coming up with our player profiles and teamy spikes and things like that.

1752
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
We're both of exiled characters.

1753
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
The discovery part of me is ultra excited.

1754
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
And I, and I'll mind you, that's coming from someone who kind of knows all the content.

1755
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I'm still, because there's something different about making it versus actually playing it live

1756
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
with the players, seeing them discover it, uniques being linked in chat and on Reddit

1757
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
and all of that is just so, so, so cool.

1758
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
So we're going to get a massive dose of that.

1759
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
And it is like genuinely exciting to just see how people are going to think, you know,

1760
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
what's worth one chaos or what's with 10 chaos, what's worth the high.

1761
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
If chaos is even the metric.

1762
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Is chaos even the currency that people settle on already?

1763
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
We were arguing about this earlier.

1764
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I'm pretty sure that one C spam in chat might turn into one E.

1765
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Cause like, you know, one exalt, given that exalt is now.

1766
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I think it'll be chaos.

1767
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
People probably, I've removed will still be.

1768
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
People don't appreciate by the way.

1769
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Like, so when we say we've increased them,

1770
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
you're going to be getting multiple exalts in act one in, in Peewee 2.

1771
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Like we actually have increased that a lot.

1772
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
It isn't just like an idle, you know, like thing.

1773
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I can say exalts becoming the new kind of like chaos.

1774
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Yeah.

1775
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,000
And then chaos being the new device.

1776
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I actually agree.

1777
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I actually agree.

1778
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Um, but we'll, yeah, we'll see.

1779
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
That's my point.

1780
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
It's the economy, right?

1781
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Like who even knows?

1782
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
The market will have to.

1783
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
But I like they were already arguing about this.

1784
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
It's good fun.

1785
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Um, so, uh, do you have some kind of like beta release roadmap for updates and things

1786
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
like that for people to look forward to with that?

1787
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I mean, we certainly did have one six months ago when we, but now that we're,

1788
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
but now that we're, uh, you know, now that we're sort of getting to, to release,

1789
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
it's like, Oh my God.

1790
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Like, you know, we have to look at it.

1791
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So, I mean, look, I, I, I, I don't think it'll be any less than six months.

1792
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And, um, I think it could any, could easily end up being more.

1793
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Um, I certainly don't want to, I mean, look 2025, I think really want to, uh, to, to

1794
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
be, you know, full release in 2025.

1795
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I, I don't really want to be spending more than a year.

1796
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Um, that would be, um, that would be pretty crazy.

1797
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
But I mean, honestly, like we have to get all the content finished, um, and all that

1798
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
sort of stuff.

1799
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Um, you know, we always feel like we underestimate these things.

1800
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Uh, and of course we have to, um, learn what we need to learn.

1801
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
We have to get the game to the point when it is, uh, really fun.

1802
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Um, you know, we have to, we have to, um, make sure that like all of the things that,

1803
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
you know, we've got the difficulty right for all the players, we've got the economy right,

1804
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
like all this stuff.

1805
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I mean, there's a lot of things that we're going to, you know, we have to sort out.

1806
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
And so I kind of have a feeling that the first few weeks at least are going to just be a scramble

1807
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
of like, you know, um, oh crap, someone like worked this crazy thing out and we found this thing.

1808
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
And like, you know, the, the, that, that's always scary.

1809
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Um, you know, because it's just, uh, when we add content to POE1, it's like at least the kind of base of stuff

1810
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
that we have is kind of, you know, well tested and people know kind of what's going on with it.

1811
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
But, uh, here it's like just complete new world.

1812
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
And we're the kind of game that has a lot of ability for players to do stuff that we wouldn't anticipate.

1813
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Um, you know, we have, um, the, the, you know, just the way support gems work and everything like that.

1814
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:04,000
So I just, there's certainly a lot of worry that like, there's just going to be builds that are like completely ridiculous

1815
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
that we just never anticipated combining certain things in different ways.

1816
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
We don't expect, you know, with hundreds of support gems, it can be like that.

1817
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
So, uh, you know, that's going to be an interesting one.

1818
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
It will happen.

1819
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Yeah, for sure.

1820
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
It is inevitable, right?

1821
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Like there's nothing we can even do about it because you, you, you need hundreds and thousands of hours of testing to be able to do that with what can only be done with hundreds of thousands of players.

1822
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Um, and, but that's also the magic of it all, which is awesome.

1823
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:34,000
That's why I was asking you, like, are you literally really doing 12 classes in 36 sentences?

1824
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Like actually?

1825
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1826
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
We have, we have, we know what we want to do.

1827
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
It's a bit unhinged.

1828
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It is a bit.

1829
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Um, but, uh, you know, uh, we, we like a challenge.

1830
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I mean, you know, the, the, the studio that produces a passive skill tree, like we do, uh, clearly, uh, has a bit of a glutton for punishment, uh, for the card to just like mixing.

1831
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
You totally put it on six and then like, I don't know, added more later in an expansion or something.

1832
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Um, yeah, I mean, maybe we could have, I mean, look, this is the point.

1833
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
This is the plan.

1834
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Um, you know, I mean like as you go through, as people go through early access, it's going to feel like there's just expansion content coming up pretty frequently.

1835
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Um, just because, you know, we have all the stuff that we kind of, you know, got some of the way, a lot of the way through.

1836
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
So yeah, there's, there's stuff that come in.

1837
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Look, I'm pretty sure like I really want to get the Druid out.

1838
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Like we announced it, we've talked about it.

1839
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Um, it's a lot of fun.

1840
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Um, you know, I'm keen to get that out there as soon as we can.

1841
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Um, you know, the Huntress, we've talked a bunch about as well.

1842
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
There's like, those kinds of things I think will be, you know, we'll be able to move, uh, towards those pretty quick.

1843
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Um, but, uh, you know, there's, yeah, obviously more to do.

1844
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:42,000
The other thing you mentioned talking roadmap like things is, um, we've always been, you know, it's hard to predict because a lot of what will happen is, and what we leave space for is reacting to what the players want.

1845
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Mmhmm . . . and so if you plan everything for so

1846
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Yeah.

1847
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:51,000
You're gonna have very, very, very slow reaction times to fixing, you know, or adding certain content with them.

1848
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,000
You know, maybe the issues are other campaign needs more events or this class, needs more of this or something.

1849
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
So if you're planning, then you're going to be delivering on what they want.

1850
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,000
want solved like a year down the line or even longer and where we like to remain very very

1851
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,000
dynamic and like you know you want to be able to fix that stuff like oh well this is the main

1852
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,000
problem like sure obviously you need more than a week sometimes most of the time but we want it

1853
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:19,000
generally to be that the next releases expansions updates whatever can alleviate as many of those

1854
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:25,000
problems as possible so yeah the you try not to get too strict with the planning is generally

1855
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
been our philosophy because especially when it comes to actually having the live service product

1856
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:35,000
out because that is very very important otherwise you're you're never going to seem like you're doing

1857
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:40,000
what people want and what are you doing if not that so that actually is good point like i was going to

1858
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,000
ask what do you folks what does the team want out of the beta because obviously it's like a good way

1859
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,000
to market the game but it's also you know key to shaping the game in the future like the actual

1860
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,000
beta it's not just early access i think one of the most important things i think it's going to be

1861
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,000
really good for the development team to get back into a live mindset and like get it back into the

1862
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
idea of like everything we make is ship is shipping people are seeing this like get back into this you

1863
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
know people are seeing you know like actually getting back on that and like yeah like and like being

1864
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
able to sort of see directly like okay we make something that goes in the game people like it don't

1865
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
like it like that kind of stuff like and that that really like that has been our studio for like

1866
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:19,000
most of its lifetime obviously we know before we released pw1 it wasn't but after that point i mean we are a

1867
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:24,000
company like we are a company that likes to think that we can do live service better than anyone else like

1868
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,000
that is our goal um and so like getting back into that again you know for the entire for everyone

1869
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
in the studio so that everyone's working on things that are going to be releasing within you know

1870
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:39,000
certainly in less time than you know than three months away um is i think be really really good

1871
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:44,000
for us again um i look forward to just being able to do that because these these long term like really

1872
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,000
long term things like that span over years so you go so long without proper feedback like stuff kind

1873
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,000
of gets made and then like yeah you know it's not really in a real game and so it doesn't probably lose

1874
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
perspective and you absolutely lose perspective on this stuff so i think that um that's just going

1875
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:03,000
to be a really great to get back to that again yeah i honestly as you said it is early access it is a

1876
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:09,000
beta period and i'd say you know personally speaking the thing that and we we mentioned it briefly about

1877
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
the character balance and the builds that are broken and all that that's obviously pretty useful to me

1878
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:20,000
right yeah plus we have other systems in there like you know the checkpointing system right you

1879
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
have to kill the boss in one life you know these are things we haven't mass tested and obviously other

1880
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:30,000
games have and they work and that's awesome um there are other things like you know the end game system

1881
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:36,000
is a little bit less forgiving and that if you die you fail the map right these things are things that

1882
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,000
we obviously need to test and iterate on in the future by adjusting the difficulty and stuff like that

1883
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:47,000
and you especially as you get towards this point of um you know the end game like okay act one has

1884
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:52,000
been tested like crazy yeah right and you get less and less testing as it goes on because you get

1885
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:58,000
less um people you know they've just been around for less time and so yeah it's going to be a huge

1886
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:04,000
amount of iteration and feedback and from the players and us just you know re-evaluating all the stuff

1887
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
and the thing is we're always dynamic about that stuff like we'll just change things if it's wrong

1888
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,000
we'll redesign it we'll come up with a new way um jonathan's a firm believer of if a doesn't work

1889
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
and b doesn't work then we'll find c we'll find option c we'll find option d and we'll keep changing

1890
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,000
things and we'll make it work so yeah it's going to be a lot of that iteration on our design decisions

1891
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:30,000
how forgiving because like the game is pretty hard you know it can be pretty hard and so when you're on

1892
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,000
that fine line of like you know things are difficult um you know it's not too easy to know if you've

1893
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
tilted one way or the other so you know finding what everyone agrees should be the common corrected

1894
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
difficulty is something that i will obviously be paying very very very close attention to it's a

1895
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:51,000
pretty hard thing to nail down when you are making the game um and so you've we've seen that a lot

1896
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
where you folks have been pretty willing to change and then re-change and re-change again some of the

1897
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,000
core features like flasks and the waypointing system and portals and keeping that kind of mindset

1898
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
going into the beta then of course i mean look we're always willing to change stuff like that flask thing

1899
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
like the most recent change to that was like ultra recent um yeah like uh i don't have we even had

1900
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:14,000
like a a closed beta of that yet was that no i think i think we haven't yeah but i mean i think

1901
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
it's way better than it was like it's uh the things things have improved a lot and honestly like that's

1902
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
one of those things we've been wanting to do something to sort out flasks for ages yeah and it

1903
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,000
really came about because um when actually looking at what new players were having trouble with when

1904
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:32,000
they were playing flask piano was actually like even from the very beginning of the game actually ended up

1905
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
being one of those things that like people just had probably just like just the manual dexterity

1906
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:41,000
required to like hit all your different flask keys and then uh like no like you have to know when one

1907
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
of your flasks has run out so you can move to the next one and like various things like that like all

1908
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,000
that stuff actually was like just a weirdly a large amount of mechanical complexity right from the very

1909
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
beginning um and then even at endgame i don't think it was really that satisfying either because you

1910
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
ended up with like you know just like having to press all these buttons all the time and obviously it's

1911
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
all utility flasks that people are using at endgame um and then we kind of tried to band-aid

1912
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,000
this in poe one with the um you know some of the flask automation stuff that was added there

1913
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:09,000
but there was still this idea that um uh that you're still more powerful if you uh don't automate

1914
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:15,000
so therefore you know like it's like you know it's like there's that trade-off there so um you're just

1915
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:20,000
more powerful if you get mage blood really sure i guess i guess i mean it's all automated and you're

1916
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
very sure all right but um you know so the point is effectively that the charm stuff that we're doing

1917
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
effectively means that you no longer the game is making that decision of like you know the that stuff will

1918
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
be automated you no longer have to do that like crazy flask piano to get the best um you know the

1919
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
best out of your character and i think that is definitely a step in the right direction um and

1920
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,000
uh the other thing as well is it actually makes the the crafting uh more meaningful i think on the

1921
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
flasks because when you've got like uh five slots then um like the individual mods and the individual

1922
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
stuff like seems to tend to not matter as much i mean obviously you know people want instant

1923
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
recovery and things like that but you know like the uh the but but like now it's like the actual

1924
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,000
it's much more meaningful like on your life flask the choice between do i want instant or do i want way

1925
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
more uh like life like that kind of stuff actually can be a lot more meaningful once you've only got

1926
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:06,000
one um so yeah i think i think it is a lot better personally you have uh we'll we'll jump ahead to

1927
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:13,000
flask since we're on the topic you have um uh locked in effectively the fact that there's a mana flask

1928
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
there now so that there's always going to be a mana flask and how does that how does that tie into

1929
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
your design for mana and are we always going to be using mana flask slot or um if we solve another way

1930
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:27,000
what does it do you can absolutely solve another way and then you'll just have a flask slot that isn't doing

1931
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,000
anything for sure um but i think it kind of has to work that way because we um really don't want

1932
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:37,000
um yeah like once you sort of start getting into changing changing that around um i feel like it's

1933
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,000
the system sort of starts to break with regard to like you know the the feeling of like i know where

1934
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
mana is i know where my health is like that kind of stuff that being said you know we've always got

1935
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
uniques and stuff like that um i believe there's already yeah there is a unique there's a unique

1936
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
that allows you to equip two yeah but the thing is then that's a build choice that you're making

1937
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,000
uh so it's a little bit different um and that's fine um but uh yeah i think the the system as it

1938
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,000
works now just yeah it's a lot easier so it does sound like on the mana side of things then that

1939
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:07,000
there are going to be multiple angles of solving mana of course we've got leech um edition number 475

1940
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:14,000
uh is how it works uh and uh we've finally got it right this time um so you know um the the and

1941
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:20,000
yeah i think it works i think it's good so i think that leech uh it'll be more common i'm not gonna have to

1942
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
like crack out the leech diagram showing the different buckets and things like i was saying

1943
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
i think i think that leech might be no i think i was gonna say leech is one of the topics in the

1944
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:34,000
studio that has most of them wasted the most designer time of anything in the industry but i actually

1945
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:38,000
don't think it's that i think the actual worst offender is what stats should decks give you i

1946
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:43,000
think that that is like that one has wasted so there's so many arguments about that i feel like

1947
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
that one's never come to the fore like we know we know about the leech one but no one is happy

1948
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:51,000
about giving accuracy but no one has a better idea than what accuracy that it can give and like

1949
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
everyone's gonna come up with like and chat a bit i bet they'll be like saying oh you know it can

1950
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:59,000
give this or this whatever um but uh there's like yeah seriously there's been endless arguments about

1951
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:06,000
that topic it's like it's outrageous uh yeah yeah yeah hmm you've got me thinking about it now yeah

1952
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
i mean speed would be good but then i know it's probably too much

1953
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,000
something like decks you should yeah deck stacking speed we can get all the designers down here right now

1954
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,000
i know we'll just have it we'll just have it out again we'll just have it out again the longest q a

1955
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:26,000
of all time yeah yeah it's already gonna be that sometimes you're just like just you start the day

1956
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
you're like here are the problems we need to solve and then you're like what about the

1957
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:34,000
accuracy on decks comes up again it's 3 p.m and we're still discussing dexterity yeah yeah

1958
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:41,000
so just make it accuracy exactly exactly that is literally how it comes back to accuracy every time

1959
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:49,000
this is okay yeah um rewinding a little bit um we can't forget our roots with path of exile one of

1960
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:55,000
course so for the poe one enjoyers uh what is the plan for poe one during the course of this beta is

1961
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,000
there going to be leagues launching uh is it on the back burner yeah um it absolutely will be leagues

1962
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,000
launching now i can't i don't know the exact date but the plan is kind of late february but i mean look

1963
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,000
it's it's we'll see what happens i will admit that unfortunately we did have to steal a few poe one

1964
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,000
resources just towards the end here um which is uh the kind of a been a bit unfortunate i really

1965
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,000
wish we didn't have to but uh yeah as i said we kind of underestimated some of the stuff but

1966
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:22,000
um everyone is going to be going back to p we won again um for the uh february for the february league

1967
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,000
um and uh you know we're going to make sure that we can we can do that like one of the things that

1968
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
um was a big problem for our studio when we had a long-term project and a short-term project yeah

1969
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
is that um you know you've always had that thing of like it's always you always want to work on the

1970
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
short-term thing yeah so now that we've got two short-term things uh coming up actually it's going

1971
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
to be a bit easier to prioritize in some respects because you know it's like it's all it's just like

1972
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:48,000
it's all that stuff is then um you know it's like coming up soon so uh but we'll see we'll see how it

1973
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:55,000
goes but uh yeah we need to get that p we won expansion out next yeah obviously you know i just

1974
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
want to always make it clear that you know the reason why things can't be so planned out is again

1975
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:04,000
we're just releasing this game yeah um obviously we pivoted to end game and then that needed more

1976
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:11,000
resources and then of course combined with the fact that um you know things obviously change

1977
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
there are unpredictable things in the environment we can't necessarily guarantee and then of course

1978
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:23,000
you have um you know uh christmas coming up and all of that right there's so many variables to

1979
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:28,000
consider and but we also don't know how much time is going to be invested necessarily or need to be

1980
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
invested into live operations for post-release how many problems are going to go wrong how many

1981
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:38,000
builds how many of the uniques are broken how many you know and where do all these resources go

1982
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:43,000
there are like just millions of variables here to consider and so like it can get very very difficult

1983
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:49,000
especially at this time but once you release you have a uh a bit of a grace period so to speak

1984
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
where more like a period of extreme amounts of fire where we're putting out fires everywhere

1985
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:59,000
but we have a we have a period where we're fixing everything you get everything stable and then we're

1986
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:04,000
going to be like all right let's recalibrate figure everything out and what is our plans and then

1987
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:09,000
establish all of that based also on the feedback we get from that you know period where everything's

1988
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
on fire um not to make it sound like it's gonna be bad but that is the inevitability is that there's

1989
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
always problems hopefully it appears good from a player perspective but there's always going to be

1990
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
there's always going to be like oh my god people found this and you know like yeah we don't have to

1991
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:28,000
see all the fires yeah like ideally ideally the best thing is when we're able to fix some kind of

1992
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
exploit before people even hear about it yeah and when i say exploit i'm just talking about some broken

1993
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:36,000
thing like if we like so we obviously normally have to worry about like the whole mid-league nerf

1994
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
concept but it's like if you can if you can deal with something within like an hour or two of it

1995
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
happening then it's like you're kind of okay because um you know that no one had a chance to kind of

1996
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
like everyone everyone didn't swap their build over to it or whatever yeah um but uh yeah we're gonna be

1997
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,000
really on the ball for pwee 2 just because there's so many things that are new well i mean look we

1998
01:57:54,000 --> 01:58:00,000
have several bosses with several elevators how many of them can be pushed up the elevator you know

1999
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
what i mean well that's what i mean when i say a fire i'm talking about bosses getting pushed up

2000
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:09,000
elevators like that's not okay yeah i am liking my mercenary flashbang knockback is very fun

2001
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:15,000
right yeah you need to look into that by the way the whole flashbang uh i feel like you're gonna nerf my

2002
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
build yeah yeah stay away from my grenada already yeah

2003
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:23,000
no no these are the fun things discovering that stuff can be very fun for the players it's just

2004
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:27,000
internally it's like oh no we have to what are we doing it can get a little bit panicky after release

2005
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
you know and it you know there's lots of things going on you're like oh geez what do i solve first

2006
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:38,000
but um obviously you know it's the same as pwee 1 we're good at it at this point um got some

2007
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:43,000
experience yeah you uh aren't going to be torturing us with like releasing beta stuff at the same time as

2008
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:47,000
pwee 2 league launch pwee 1 league launches yeah the plan is to uh keep them separated a bit

2009
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:50,000
from each other so that uh you know you get a chance to play they make me choose

2010
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:59,000
so uh we saw a cinematic to put it lightly it was pretty that was quite epic and uh i know it's

2011
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,000
been cooking for quite some time and uh that was pretty exciting but we've also seen just a lot of

2012
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:10,000
story stuff happening you know on a much higher level than previously now so yeah stepping up your

2013
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
storytelling game here a bit yeah so we're really wanting to make sure that the storytelling in pwee 2

2014
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000
is much better than what it was in pwee 1 um like you know there's a lot more kind of um

2015
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:25,000
i guess uh like that kind of like stuff with the like the introductions to boss fights and the outros

2016
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
and things like that like all that stuff we've just got a lot more storytelling going in um all of

2017
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
those um all those things um we do have the intro cutscene there's also um can kind of like light

2018
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
like between the acts there's these kind of like more kind of uh motion graphic type uh cutscenes just

2019
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
kind of established things and there might be some more surprises later on in the game as well

2020
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:46,000
uh not in early access unfortunately uh later on that uh that we can uh that you can see as well

2021
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,000
but ultimately we just want to make sure that um like i think a lot of people who got through the

2022
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:55,000
pwee 1 story had no idea what was happening by the end um and so uh effectively want to make sure

2023
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,000
that that is not the case this time around that people really are able to absorb things but guilty

2024
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:04,000
one thing i will say though is that it's ultra important to us that we don't break the feeling

2025
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:09,000
that like when you're playing a second time that like that it feels like we don't want it to feel

2026
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
annoying the second time yeah we were talking about this this morning yeah yeah don't take the

2027
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
control out of the player exactly so yeah i'm a personally a believer of the fact that if you

2028
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,000
just change if when you change the camera position for a cutscene um immediately it feels way more

2029
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
annoying like because there's this whole this whole thing of like like if you click on an npc and like

2030
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,000
the camera changes position like sure when you're playing through the campaign the first time

2031
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:34,000
um that kind of thing is like you know like that can be cool but um then the the if if you're um

2032
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:39,000
uh like you're playing through the you know second third fourth fifth time you want to just be able to go to

2033
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
the npc and click click click and just get past and without feeling like uh you've you've had to

2034
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,000
sort of worry about anything so um yeah like effectively we want to make sure that it's still

2035
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,000
um that we still have that you know because ultimately you know we're a game you expect

2036
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
people to people to play through many times so ideally we can kind of deliver both the situation

2037
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,000
where the first time you play through it it feels like an amazing story that you're getting that

2038
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
you're taking seriously that you're understanding that you you know there's like all those sort of

2039
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:06,000
touch points and um you know little little um you know things just all through while also

2040
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
maintaining the fact that if you know what you're doing it's like you don't have to go talk to

2041
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
some quest giver just to get a quest like you could just go do the thing you know without

2042
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
having to talk to someone about it first um so uh you know that kind of stuff is really important

2043
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,000
just to make the you know that that stuff work well when you when you know what you're doing

2044
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
yeah you said something this morning that stuck with me where you said like part of exile is a

2045
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
game where the player's meta knowledge is allowed and encouraged absolutely absolutely

2046
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:30,000
you're allowed to cheat this quest effectively there's what the character knows and there's what

2047
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,000
the player knows and in our game what the player knows is needs to be sufficient as far as like

2048
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
being able to progress the storyline if you can you're not you don't want to have it so you just

2049
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:43,000
talk to mbc just to find out something you already knew as a player um yeah like if you know you kill

2050
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
this boss you get the next area's waypoint so you just like kill it log out log in

2051
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
right i love doing that

2052
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:58,000
yeah um so you explained to me the other day the um kind of the context for the beast and how that leads

2053
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,000
into the cutscene in the beginning of uh pwee 2 from pwee 1 and that i think helped put it in a lot more

2054
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:07,000
perspective for me and made me appreciate and understand what's going on yeah yeah so effectively

2055
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:13,000
what you're seeing in the opening cutscene is effectively the um a new uh a new seed of a beast

2056
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:20,000
um that um is going to be uh is growing now in pwee 1 um you know the beast uh the beast was killed

2057
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:25,000
and then uh what happened in response to that is a bunch of all the gods in the world were able to

2058
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:30,000
um uh you know were able to effectively rise again and you killed a bunch of them but um there are more

2059
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:36,000
uh you know in the world uh and effectively um you know we don't want to spoil too much about the

2060
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:42,000
storyline overall but effectively obviously someone here uh you know the count is wanting to uh harness

2061
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:47,000
the power of the beast once again um and then we have the uh mysterious figure there who is saying

2062
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:53,000
you know uh no don't do this this always turns out badly uh you know comment in chat that i loved

2063
02:02:53,000 --> 02:03:00,000
that was like stop opening eldritch boxes exactly exactly why do people keep doing this yeah yeah i

2064
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:07,000
i would yeah if someone handed you a mysterious orb wouldn't you press the button i mean yeah

2065
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:16,000
yeah exactly exactly exactly yeah yeah i mean i'm gonna try but who knows how many hours it's gonna

2066
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:22,000
take me indeed indeed so um we had a fun moment earlier where you were watching it and you were

2067
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:29,000
like oh we really need need to rename that passive because he's a karui and and it's a wolf it's called a

2068
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
great wolf's hound the great wolf obviously being in it so he went out is a might history

2069
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:39,000
started telling him i stomped out of the room and i was like we need to rename that notable he's karui

2070
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:47,000
and then i was kindly reminded that actually he was an orphan who an orphan and was adopted by

2071
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:54,000
a isomite and raised and so yes there is a mixture of karui and isomite background and i was like

2072
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:59,000
it works you were wrong fair enough i walked back in here all sad and yeah whatever my bad

2073
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
it's fine the name is good he looked so chastised when he came back in but that just like

2074
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:09,000
points to the fact that i feel like you're doing a lot more with the characters here for sure you

2075
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,000
even mentioned that ascendancy stuff is going to have an impact story-wise um like with that's

2076
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:17,000
why we just think a lot about this kind of stuff so the uh the acolyte of and i always get this

2077
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:22,000
name wrong the acolyte of is it chalula chayula i always say this wrong um so uh the acolyte of

2078
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
chayula for example um so that we have this sort of storyline with the origins of the monks where

2079
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:32,000
there's like an order of monks who uh worship a uh thing they call the dreamer and uh the dreamer

2080
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:37,000
is actually uh uh chayula so um and they don't know this so they're effectively worshiping a

2081
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,000
breach demon so uh the acolyte of chayula is effectively you embracing the fact that i'm

2082
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,000
worshiping a breach demon i'm just going to go all the way just and uh you know i'm in too deep now

2083
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,000
yeah exactly we're just gonna we're just gonna do it so uh yeah there's a lot of thinking like that

2084
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
that goes into these things like you know what is the history of these uh people like you know

2085
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
because i think a lot of that stuff inspires uh interesting mechanics as well so for example

2086
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
on that one you've got that into the breach skill which kind of means you know you're always in a

2087
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
breach all the time you can see the like you know things going on like that stuff is i think that

2088
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:09,000
there's a lot of cool inspiration there so coming up with that storyline stuff um for for that stuff

2089
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,000
just i think just yeah there's a couple other little little things that i think is cool as well and

2090
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:19,000
hopefully people will notice and pay attention to so there's one of the bosses that was shown as uh

2091
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:26,000
uses a lot of time or chronomancy and um interestingly if you are a uh sorceress and

2092
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:32,000
you ascend to chronomancer and you then go to fight that boss um if you for example try to use time

2093
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:38,000
freeze uh the boss is like yeah there are no that doesn't work on me and has a dialogue line and if

2094
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:44,000
you cast temporal chains on them he's like you know just puts it back on you and it's like yeah and so

2095
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
there's interesting things like that and it doesn't like change things on a grand scale right it doesn't

2096
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:53,000
make a certain class not viable or anything like that but there's this interesting little quirks and

2097
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:58,000
quips everywhere different bosses have different intro lines depending on what class you're playing

2098
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
um they have different skill lines sometimes depending on what class you're playing yeah um

2099
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,000
we've got different dialogue all through the campaign for different classes like the um the

2100
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,000
sorceress i was obviously from the maraketh when she goes back to the maraketh there's kind of a

2101
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
little backstory there about how she was banished originally um so you know she needs to find a way that

2102
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,000
you know to be she needs to be accepted back into their culture again uh you know like we've got things like uh

2103
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:22,000
you know the character we talked about earlier um so the warrior you know was an orphan um you know he

2104
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,000
uh he was brought up by actually one of the npcs in act one town so obviously there's a whole

2105
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
different dialogue there because he's effectively his adopted son you know we've got things like that

2106
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,000
um there's there's a lot of thought that's gone into you know just trying to make it feel like all

2107
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,000
these character classes have some level of involvement with the world you know they didn't just come into

2108
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:43,000
existence the moment that you there's um other little things so like more on the narrative side

2109
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,000
obviously we saw the world map you have the icons that show different things that are in

2110
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:52,000
each act like all the things you want to explore find and yeah awesome but each of them also has a

2111
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:59,000
little bit of a kind of a little bit of text on them as well and like for example the um there's one

2112
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:06,000
in one of the first areas in the game that's just like a camp of iron count guards and um you know

2113
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:12,000
we showed it in a trailer when the when the ranger class trailer we did um you know whenever it was

2114
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:17,000
you saw the ranger shoot some of the kill some of them because they were trying to like hurt a child

2115
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:22,000
you know and the child was just trying to get some food and the ranger just like snipes them with

2116
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:27,000
arrows and kills them ruthlessly and so you read this thing and you're like you know you hear whispers

2117
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:32,000
of an iron count you know uh scouting party that was slain by a rogue archer or something like that

2118
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
so you get these little things where we like connecting a lot of little dots and even that you

2119
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:40,000
absorb a little bit of interesting little information um you've got other things for example when you enter

2120
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:46,000
an area it only not only says the name at the top now it has a almost a subtitle text that's giving you a

2121
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,000
little bit a little bit of history these little things like somehow make the world building feel

2122
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:56,000
so much better and when you approach certain landmark rooms and you walk into them you'll get a banner at

2123
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
the top as well which says what it is and gives again a little bit of a thing and all these little

2124
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:06,000
micro uh narrative delivery mechanisms like make you feel way more immersed in the world and way more

2125
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:11,000
aware of what's going on and way more connected to your character way more connected to the bosses to

2126
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:17,000
the npcs um it's yeah there's a lot we're doing now that we certainly never did before we didn't

2127
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:23,000
even think of before um but yeah it's it's i like that a lot because like as an action rpg gamer i don't

2128
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:29,000
really care too much about plot but i do want a really cool world to be blowing monsters up in

2129
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:32,000
basically that's like i want the characters to be cool i want the baddies to be cool and i want like

2130
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,000
the things happening around me that like in you know build out a bit of that story without me having to

2131
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
stop healing stuff yeah and it sounds like there's more of that going on as well which is great

2132
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:49,000
there's the baddies being cool i mean that's that's how we almost designed an ascendancy class in here

2133
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,000
just before when we were watching that trailer earlier yes so what you were you were saying a

2134
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,000
shadow you came up with a shadow ascendancy yeah yeah we were well internally we had some developers

2135
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:05,000
watching the trailer yesterday getting excited about and then i was like i want to play that i want to

2136
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,000
play that character i want to be that character yeah that's awesome that like kind of vile

2137
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:15,000
thormaturge type character and so like cool all of a sudden it's like we should make that a class

2138
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,000
and then we had another guy like suggest it should be a shadow and so now i'm like oh yeah we're

2139
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:24,000
definitely come on we have to do a vile thormaturge like shadow ascendancy like that's gonna be cool

2140
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:29,000
you can do awesome things now even i know it's hard to see because you hide it under all the armor but

2141
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:35,000
you can do things like you know with our character classes just due to the upgrades and models we all of a

2142
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:39,000
sudden now the character can have tattoos added to them and stuff like that is completely feasible in

2143
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:44,000
the future and like i would i want to do a lot more of that stuff like for the um there's little

2144
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,000
things like for the uh war bringer i think was the class name on the warrior when you take that

2145
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
ancestral totem node all your totems now have like an extra blue glow to them kind of like they're

2146
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:59,000
enhanced by this ancestral magic um and what we also want to do is has uh add tattoos as well that like

2147
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,000
glow blue when you're using certain skills and all that so heaps of little things that again

2148
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:07,000
connects all the culture and all that stuff together and make you feel like you know it's

2149
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:12,000
believable as opposed and this is a character as opposed to this is just a mechanic and you know

2150
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
makes picking an ascendancy more epic i know that there was a part in the trailer that was like not

2151
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
fully finished where you were saying that it doesn't really do anything but i know you want it to be

2152
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:23,000
like a cool moment where some power goes yeah absolutely we just hadn't finished the vfx yet

2153
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:29,000
even the uh another one the blood mage when you like you know play the blood mage now you get an

2154
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:33,000
additive surge on your character whenever you cast spells you're getting like almost blood

2155
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,000
bending kind of vibe going on and like drawing it from their veins and sending out a fireball

2156
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,000
it's cool yeah it's real cool yeah you can have like the tattoos get tattooed on them as they

2157
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:47,000
as they ascend and things like that i mean that just makes taking ascendancy way more cool which

2158
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:51,000
is already i think i almost feel like ascendancy is more important than the classes for

2159
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:56,000
players kind of like feeling the vibe of what they want to do with their character for sure because

2160
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,000
i mean the classes are pretty open you can play whatever skills whatever weapon sure you're on a

2161
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,000
passive tree at a start point but you know by high level you kind of go wherever you want to go

2162
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,000
using jewels especially getting off class stuff you can kind of be whatever you want with the base class

2163
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,000
yeah so eventually yeah the ascendancy is what becomes more of that important identifying feature

2164
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:19,000
because that's what you have actually chosen that makes you distinct um that another different class

2165
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
wouldn't be able to actually have so yeah yeah so you want to make that super super cool

2166
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
and on that note uh i know i was definitely confused i know people definitely confused and

2167
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
a little worried about ascendancy and what's happening with that and people were like watching

2168
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:39,000
the like um the second trial and being like oh what if i don't like this oh it's just another lab again

2169
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:46,000
but i want you to like lay it out as like simply as possible like how how do you ascend yeah so

2170
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:51,000
effectively um in the full game there's going to be three ascendancy trials for early access there's two

2171
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
and effectively you can use any of those ascendancy trials to be able to do your ascension you choose

2172
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:01,000
yeah you choose which one and effectively um if you uh as you get to higher level like higher level

2173
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:05,000
keys for those trials um that will unlock uh more points like if you do it at certain level break

2174
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:09,000
points uh that will allow you to get more points for those classes so if you want to just play the

2175
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:15,000
entire just just only the trial of the chaos god um with um uh you know to get all your points uh then

2176
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:18,000
you can just decide to do that just play at higher and higher levels and you get more points as you go

2177
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
through um you know if you want to do a mix that's fine too

2178
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:24,000
um personally i think people will want to try out all the different content i mean you might

2179
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
think that you um but even even within the trials there's there's choices right like

2180
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:34,000
um i know that there's always contention around traps but uh because in the um because in the uh

2181
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
trial of the sekumers you can choose which rooms you want to go to if you don't want to deal with

2182
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
traps you just don't pick those rooms right like yeah you don't go into the gauntlet rooms you can

2183
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:46,000
just go other things do the combat ones and that's fine too so effectively it's like you always get to

2184
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:50,000
choose like what you're doing there um like it's funny because like i know traps are so contentious

2185
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
but um also there are other people who just enjoy that stuff so you know you want to have something

2186
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:58,000
for all those people too there's these like path of exile divisive content but lots of choice and

2187
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:02,000
you can choose what to do and what not to do and then we're embracing that here now and that i mean

2188
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,000
you're clearly leaning into that now you have you have i mean such a competitive advantage in that you

2189
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,000
have so much content and even with pwee 2 that's still going to be the case so you can lean into that

2190
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:18,000
like making content that is spicier but divisive for sure and now you're like separating trees and having

2191
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,000
these things be a little able to be focused on a lot more um and you're doing that with the trial

2192
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:28,000
with the ascendancies so and you can like you can kind of do all of them and drip feed yourself

2193
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:33,000
smaller and there's also stuff that you're going to be getting from those like specific rewards and

2194
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:37,000
everything that might incentivize you to do that but of course on the other hand if you don't want

2195
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:41,000
to do that content uh we have open full open trade right you can just trade for the rewards and

2196
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:46,000
that's fine too so uh you know like that's always part of the yes like the rewards there for example

2197
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:52,000
um like jewels drop throughout the world but if you want to get more jewels you go and run sanctum

2198
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:57,000
now if you want to get the radius jewels you you do oh it's sanctum i can't it's trial of the

2199
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:02,000
sycamore so just for anyone who um isn't a path of xl1 player um this is effectively a sequel to

2200
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:07,000
sanctum league that we did in path of xl1 um so it's mechanically very similar yeah but um it's

2201
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:12,000
obviously you know ameriketh uh you know like ameriketh trial now and you know we've changed a lot of

2202
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
things about it have changed you know like the content is new but it is effectively the

2203
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:20,000
same overall mechanic uh you know in terms of that sort of roguelike uh mechanic that we have

2204
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,000
the same with the other one you have ultimatum and poe 1 being the theme and of course now it's

2205
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:31,000
redesigned and it's evolved into a trial of chaos um so yeah a lot of people in chat would have been

2206
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:35,000
spamming ultimatum and for those who haven't played would probably be like what i don't understand

2207
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:41,000
effectively the trial of the chaos of chaos is a sequel to ultimatum um which is um and we just

2208
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:47,000
have to get used to the new names which is very hard um but uh yeah anyway the point being like

2209
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:53,000
of course and val orbs drop in the world as well and if you want a larger dose of val orbs and you

2210
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:57,000
know you don't want to trade go feel free to run some ultimatums thing is because they're all item

2211
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:01,000
generated keys as well it's not like you have to do it right then and there you can trade the keys

2212
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:08,000
away um at any point you can also buy more keys if you want to farm more of that thing um and if you

2213
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,000
just want to do it later just stockpile a bunch of them run them all at your at your leisure you

2214
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:18,000
know what i mean it's like you have the freedom they are uh itemized tradable as is a lot in path

2215
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,000
of exile tradition but well as as is everything right we do the only the only thing you can't

2216
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:26,000
trade is gold so we're like the exact opposite of most games where it's like the gold is freely

2217
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:31,000
tradable and the items get locked we're like the gold is the only thing you can't trade and every

2218
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:36,000
other item is free and open yeah and that's because you've made gold be this like way to be like

2219
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,000
you're playing the game so you have access to this and absolutely you don't want to trade that

2220
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:47,000
away effectively yeah um so how uh on the ascendancies and the trials how hard do you foresee getting your

2221
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
ascendancy to be while leveling do you expect people to fail out and attempt these things multiple times

2222
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:56,000
and what does that look like if you do well i failed the first time it is important to know that

2223
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:03,000
that first itemized key um is a quest key and we have special rules around it that if you do fail

2224
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,000
you can just repeat it right you changed that recently because uh that was something that i

2225
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
didn't actually realize you'd changed uh i guess it was a little bit too harsh to require to get

2226
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:17,000
another one yeah you weren't the only one failing it yeah um but uh yeah so pretty much you get to

2227
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:21,000
re-attempt it and um you know for something like ultimatum you know yeah you know just to immediately

2228
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:26,000
start thinking of exploits i can just do three of the waves then intentionally fail and then repeat

2229
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:31,000
them well we've thought of that don't worry you can't but um yeah the first ones are repeatable

2230
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,000
you're not going to be like you know oh what the heck now i have to just play to the whims of random

2231
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:40,000
generation to ascend like that yeah so it is it is pretty hard though like it will take you i

2232
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:46,000
definitely don't think you'll do it on your first attempt um but i did not to brag i did i did pass

2233
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,000
i was clenched though yeah okay yeah especially in that boss fight i was watching i was watching him

2234
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:54,000
do the boss fight you came by right as i was doing the boss fight you had some like kind of powerful

2235
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:00,000
boons there to be perfectly honest i got 60 move speed yeah that was part of my strategic choice i was

2236
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:06,000
watching you from i'm like how is he so fast this isn't the peewee too we just lied what was dodge

2237
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:13,000
rolls going across half the arena this game is supposed to be slow yeah it was good it was good

2238
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:19,000
fun i quite liked it i'm i like mostly like sanctum i'm not i don't want to do it all the time but i did

2239
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:23,000
quite like the trial of sekima but knowing that there's other choices so i can do ultimatum instead or

2240
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:27,000
something like that it's fun 100 so you've got these you've got these like two roguelike dungeons

2241
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:31,000
that are going into the beta that launch but they've done very differently one's got the honor

2242
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:35,000
system which is like a separate health but it's based on and scaled by your health which i noted

2243
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:39,000
is quite and your defenses now it can be fully mitigated and everything fully scaled by your

2244
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,000
character you go in in a tanky character you'll be tanky in the dungeon which is really cool

2245
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:47,000
so and then with ultimate and and just because people will ask in ultimatum there aren't any traps

2246
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:52,000
yes so uh that's no traps in ultimatum and no honor system in ultimatum if you just want more of a

2247
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,000
pure combat experience then that's your choice and then there's gonna be a third one as well

2248
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:01,000
which it will eventually secret for now so once uh once act four goes in um then we'll uh then we'll

2249
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:07,000
have a third trial so you know uh people sort of broadly know that the crew are in act four so it's

2250
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
the question of how would the crew ascend is the question there yes and if there's any other things

2251
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:17,000
that have been called trials associated with the crew at some point in the past and how likely that

2252
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,000
is to be related i'm just thinking now we're just thinking of the vile formature class before and i'm

2253
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:26,000
already thinking like oh it'd be so cool if you ascend and ultimatum we want the trial master to

2254
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:30,000
say different lines to you because you're like choosing the way of the vile i'm just i'm you

2255
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:34,000
can't i can't stop thinking about all this stuff i did hear a few of his lines and some of the

2256
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:38,000
gameplay jonathan was showing me is quite good i love i love that he's back the uh trial master

2257
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:46,000
yeah he's cool a little salty sometimes that you're taking this power it seems so uh we have uh we have

2258
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,000
the unique rewards from each of them we got like the um like you said the jewels are global but

2259
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:57,000
there are unique jewels and then there are um unique socketables from the other one yep and is it

2260
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:01,000
there's something planned to be unique from the final third trial that will be added later of course

2261
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:09,000
uh yes there is already i know what i'm not going to say it don't worry keep some secrets fine then

2262
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:15,000
again again i value the discovery right i'm certainly if i gonna if i accidentally say it it is

2263
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:22,000
certainly by mistake but yes don't and that that vile orbs from the ultimatum in particular um is

2264
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:28,000
they seem like they're a lot more important a lot more powerful i mean i certainly think that like

2265
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,000
some of the stuff is a lot better with how they work so um yeah so one of the things that we wanted

2266
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,000
to change was that implicits on items are truly implicit like you can't get rid of them they stay

2267
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:41,000
there and so that means that when you do a vile uh vile or the mod that you get there now is an

2268
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,000
addition to whatever implicit already had um which is obviously good and then the next one being that yeah

2269
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:50,000
you can get plus plus one socket above the normal limit um which is uh you know also kind of

2270
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:55,000
powerful um so especially with the soul cores so that in um you know in the uh trial of the

2271
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:01,000
trial of chaos you uh get uh soul cores that you can't get from anywhere else and those effectively are

2272
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:06,000
uh mods that are typically a bit beyond what you would normally get um uh like in on regular items

2273
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
um whereas runes which kind of drop everywhere those ones are just kind of normal everyday mods that

2274
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
you would expect to find it it just resists and damage and that kind of stuff so

2275
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:20,000
effectively the soul cores is um you know is kind of the more end gamey uh socketables that you might

2276
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:24,000
want to be using and um yeah obviously being able to get um plus one sock i mean it's something that

2277
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:29,000
everyone will want um but on the other hand there is that risk of uh you know just bricking your item

2278
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,000
so uh you know that's a the deadly gamble you have as your final crafting step there

2279
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:40,000
it's what they are vile orbs are more forgiving though they are yeah but like you know if you think about um

2280
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
we we talked about enchantment yeah so some slots you might value the enchantment over a rune or a

2281
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,000
socket slot right that probably especially towards end game i'd say that's probably going to tilt that

2282
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:53,000
way because you know well maybe a soul core contests with it but you know the whole point is that

2283
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:58,000
there's you know choice there involved um you know and then there so there's enchantment we just talked

2284
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:04,000
about the socket um there's obviously always the case of doing nothing um which happens but you know

2285
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:11,000
for um just say regular rare items uh it will re-roll like one to three modifiers that ran

2286
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:16,000
effectively do a chaos orb on one to three modifiers not all six and as much as that can

2287
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:21,000
often be a downside because if you're using on a very good item um obviously it's going to take away

2288
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:26,000
the good ones interesting um but if you're using it on a mid item you can actually turn it very good

2289
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,000
now i've had this happen like when i've been playing i've got like ah just you know life defense

2290
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:36,000
defense double res and something else that i don't want and um i'm like i'll just start

2291
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:40,000
valing everything because why not you know i've got my val orbs and i val it and it re-rolls that

2292
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,000
bottom mod into a tri-res and now i've got a tri-res double defense life helmet and i was like

2293
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:50,000
awesome so even that which is can often be perceived as a bad outcome now it isn't going to completely

2294
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:55,000
break your item and so for example if you have a weapon you know you've got your three damage mods

2295
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:00,000
um and you've got some bad suffixes it could even be an option you know like or hopefully

2296
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:04,000
it doesn't just remove all three damage mods you know whereas before it's like if it bricked it

2297
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:10,000
it often was almost always a brick right like that item is now dead so and then you told me about a

2298
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:16,000
new unique uh yeah result which i don't know if you want to swallow about the 100 yeah yeah it's cool

2299
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,000
it's so cool i'm surprised you even got that pass with that one pass rishi honestly

2300
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:27,000
i mean he got it made okay great we discussed it i i agree yeah i agree i messaged it to him thinking

2301
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:32,000
he'll be like no way this is unacceptable but now he was there was all for it didn't turn into a

2302
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:39,000
dexterity chat and so um yeah um what it effectively does is it just takes the mod values and it multiple

2303
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:45,000
it it goes up to uh i can't remember exactly the values but let's just say it's it um changes all

2304
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:53,000
the values to between 0.8 and 1.2 of what they were multiplied but it doesn't care about the minimum

2305
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:59,000
and maximums so for example if you had a thousand life calms heart you can use this to get again this

2306
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,000
is me assuming it's 20 variance but because i can't remember what we balanced it to but you'll be

2307
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:07,000
able to get a 1200 life calms heart for example now that's obviously giving up the enchantment and a

2308
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,000
socket um just think about sockets on calms heart i can't remember what we did but whatever

2309
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:19,000
um i think you can actually uh do that which is interesting but um uh ultimately it's like yeah

2310
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:26,000
now i'm choosing am i do i want the enchantment do i want an extra you know 100 something 200 life

2311
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:31,000
whatever that ends up being um or do i want the socket um so it's quite an interesting choice and

2312
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:36,000
adds an extra access of corruption to unique items that is i think corrupted divining of uniques

2313
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:41,000
yeah yeah effectively yeah it's divining them but with um higher maximums and lower

2314
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,000
surely there's going to be some broken things like max razz or something like that

2315
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:51,000
i mean we'll guess we'll find out cross that bridge when it comes to it yeah it's fine

2316
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:57,000
so that was all just talking about the trials how you actually get your ascendancies but what about

2317
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,000
the actual ascendancies themselves how are they uh how are they cooking

2318
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:09,000
um well they're fun they're cool yeah um we certainly try to get what we've tried to do is for

2319
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,000
the the class we've tried to have one that's a bit more out there yeah you know something that isn't just

2320
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:18,000
you know like if you think even about in pwee one you've got the dualist you can go like champion

2321
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:26,000
or slayer or um holy words i don't remember but you know the drill um and the gladiator and the

2322
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:31,000
problem is like okay they're all just about like hitting stuff with weapons and they haven't there's

2323
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:35,000
nothing really out there they sure that they all sound cool like don't get me wrong and they can be

2324
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:40,000
cool and they do have differences but there's nothing that's like kind of crazy um so all of a sudden

2325
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:44,000
now when you're like you know sorceress you're using all your elemental skills and now you can

2326
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:49,000
just like go into this thing that can stop time you know it's a little bit more uh crazy and you've

2327
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:54,000
got the the mercenary and you can turn into a gemling legionnaire and effectively fuse gems into your

2328
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:00,000
flesh to like you know mutate yourself you know it's like not just talking about crossbows and

2329
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,000
projectiles over and over and over and over again it's like doing kind of whack stuff so i really like

2330
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:10,000
that that's awesome and we're gonna make sure every single class has one thing that is like

2331
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:14,000
definitely out there um and then one thing that's you know more predictable more to the expectation

2332
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:20,000
of the trope you know for example the dead eye to the ranger and um but yeah lots and lots of uh

2333
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:26,000
cool interactions just cool and playing with different mechanics and we've tried to make them

2334
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:31,000
like for example none of them call out a weapon right none of them so you we're trying to make sure

2335
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:39,000
that they're broad enough to be that you might be a ranger going a dead eye but playing a caster

2336
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:44,000
right playing spells like keeping all of that open that flexibility that kind of crazy you know

2337
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:49,000
for the johnny players as we call it out there who want to just completely experiment and figure out

2338
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:54,000
you know the most broken weird stuff you know and you get things with that when you're still like okay

2339
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:00,000
okay i'm a ranger uh and i'm using a quill rain and one weapon set specced into a bunch of prod speed

2340
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:06,000
attack speed and in my second weapon set i'm using a spellcaster staff with a bunch of projectile stuff and

2341
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,000
i'm invested into more spell damage side and you've got a whack tree and all of a sudden now you're

2342
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:17,000
this like dead eye archer spellcaster mage hybrid doing all kinds of wacky stuff or like even or let's

2343
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:22,000
say the same build and experimenting with a bunch of triggers and so you're using your bow as a quill

2344
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:29,000
rain as a higher attack speed delivery mechanism for you know laying down a bunch of either ccs or slows

2345
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:35,000
or building up crowd controls and then you're using the caster stuff and like you get some pretty out

2346
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:40,000
there things going on and the important thing is it's not like just like uh benefiting only arrows

2347
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:46,000
or only bow attacks or anything like that it's broad and now you know opens up the world to what you can

2348
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:53,000
do and same like the gemling legionnaire on the mercenary is entirely just about gem slots skills

2349
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:58,000
support etc there's no you don't have to be anything you can be literally whatever build you want

2350
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:03,000
um and yeah so that that's embracing that making sure people still even though we have all these

2351
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:08,000
classes you we're embracing that path of exile you can do anything fantasy that we want people to be

2352
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:14,000
able to do and yeah if you don't want to go with the trope perfectly fine yeah it'll still be powerful

2353
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:18,000
it sounds like you're really trying to avoid that thing that we've had a couple times in poe one where

2354
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:25,000
like a certain niche is relegated to on ascendancy like that's the only way to go for it for sure it

2355
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
sounds like that's not going to be the case here well at least if we're doing our job right that

2356
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:34,000
yeah and with so many of the ascendancies as well got a lot of choices um originally the plan was to

2357
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:40,000
like have all of the poe one ascendancies available and it was some sort of weird split campaign stuff

2358
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
and all that uh i don't really know at this point it's a bit confusing it's you mentioned dead eye

2359
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
though so it sounds like some of them are coming forwards but is it all just being i think it's more

2360
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:51,000
done at this point yeah at this point they'll just be different right like originally way back when

2361
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:56,000
we were planning on just keeping the ascendancies as they were and yeah but at this point um that

2362
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:01,000
wouldn't even be good enough because like it doesn't fit the kind of like path of xl2 way of

2363
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
designing this thing so yeah i mean like we might have a class called the dead eye and it might have

2364
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:10,000
the same themes but it'll be like different actual mechanics and different things yeah i mean yeah even

2365
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:16,000
the dead eye you got tailwind works differently you've still got an additional projectile you know like

2366
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:22,000
there are there are things that certainly carry over um but it's really easy and it's honestly been

2367
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:26,000
fun just looking at them going like you know now we have all these system changes all these skills and

2368
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:32,000
everything works like this just what would the perfect class be not like how can we retrofit and

2369
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:36,000
band-aid appear we want class to work it's just way better to look at it and go here's here's all the

2370
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:41,000
things we want yeah so well yeah like when you only have now the life and mana flask and stuff it could

2371
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:46,000
obviously things don't work quite the same but then now you have the charm system and all of a

2372
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:51,000
i actually do wonder if path one would be cool with that exactly like stacking charms so so it's

2373
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:59,000
it's just here are you know 12 eventually 36 classes um it's not really like here's the pair we

2374
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:04,000
won counterpart and they're identical kind of thing anymore for sure too many things changed for that

2375
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:10,000
to even be possible anyway yeah all right that sounds very epic um we can skip over the flask and

2376
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:17,000
trinkets as we did cover that uh very well so uh moving into um skills i realized i like had many

2377
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
pages of questions here and then i was like wait we haven't even talked about like skills here

2378
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:28,000
it's so much to so much to for us to discover over the course of this beta um how has the list of

2379
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:32,000
skills been shaping up overall i mean it's certainly getting there i mean look there are even certain

2380
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:35,000
skills that won't even make it even just within the classes we have like there are still going to be

2381
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:40,000
more some more skills coming uh later on as well for the for these classes because um there there are more

2382
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:45,000
skills that we got um just about there and um yeah but just didn't quite didn't quite make it um so

2383
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:50,000
uh yeah and like getting a class finished in terms of the skills you need like um it sort of seems

2384
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:56,000
very easy when you um okay we need like you know 22 23 24th you know number of skills something like

2385
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,000
that and it seems like that's not so many and you kind of design them but when you actually come up

2386
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,000
with all of the things you know the way they interact together um you know the number of prototypes

2387
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:08,000
you have to do that kind of don't really work and you know like you end up not being fun

2388
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:12,000
um and then of course the support gem stuff like you need to make sure that every skill

2389
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
has enough viable supports so that you can actually even recommend to people to do

2390
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:20,000
uh then you need things like the uh you know the passive tree support for all of them

2391
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:26,000
you need to have um all of the uh the stuff with like buff uh the buff gems for each character class

2392
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:30,000
as well um you know you need to be thinking about uniques for the for the type of uh you know for

2393
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:34,000
the uh that can work with these things it's just like there's so many different elements to

2394
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:38,000
actually make skills work and once again it's another area i think that um was underestimated

2395
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:45,000
to some degree um uh before uh and you know like it does take a um you know to actually get that

2396
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:50,000
finished it takes a lot um so uh yeah that's been um a total struggle and we we didn't think we would

2397
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,000
have to have only six character classes initially uh at the start of early access we were thinking we

2398
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:59,000
would have eight um to begin with but uh yeah when it actually came down to actually getting to

2399
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:03,000
actually finish something uh you know like it just ended up being too much um so uh you know now

2400
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:07,000
obviously we've got a bunch i mean we've got a bunch of work on more of the classes that we've

2401
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:11,000
done you know there's things there but um it's that finishing work of like making sure that all

2402
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:16,000
the systems in the game come together to support um you know the how that how that works um that

2403
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:20,000
requires a lot doing all of that as we're still discovering how we want those systems to work

2404
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:25,000
you know like the changes to support gems and all that as we're also making support gems as we're

2405
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:30,000
making character classes just can cause things to slow down quite a bit and then we have to

2406
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:36,000
recalibrate and also yeah like it is it was an extreme amount of work that we certainly

2407
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:43,000
predicted poorly um but that was also because we are making all these cool systems to all these

2408
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:48,000
changes to all these systems which are having like immense benefits as well so yeah i would say

2409
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:54,000
it's pretty safe to expect that you know as much as you can't play them on day zero um a lot of some

2410
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:59,000
of those other classes that we have shown in the past um and some of the skills and stuff there's

2411
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:04,000
a lot there like just not to make it seem like it's shallow or anything but we will be adding those

2412
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:11,000
classes in for sure yeah the thing that keeps like surprising me is um well when you click that

2413
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:15,000
old gems tab when you're doing an uncut there's quite a lot of skills in there but you initially

2414
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:19,000
kind of box yourself away where you think okay so i'm playing the mercenary so i'm just looking at

2415
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:23,000
the crossbow skills and then i was like well what if i go look at the elemental skills and then i find

2416
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:27,000
flame wall and i'm like oh i can shoot my projectiles through that okay cool i like that but that's like

2417
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,000
surface level because you also have the weapon swap thing and you can actually viably do with the

2418
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:37,000
automated weapon swapping it's not like toxic where you have to push the button a bunch of times and

2419
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:41,000
you've got the trees that like customize whenever you do it automatically on the fly so that's like all

2420
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:47,000
of a sudden i'm like oh well why can't i use a sword on the other hand yes you absolutely that's

2421
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:52,000
actually a very cool mercenary vibe sword and crossbow so um yeah i mean that stuff is like is

2422
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:57,000
crazy i mean like in the in the actually there was one in the the the community guys recorded where

2423
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:03,000
they were using um a bell the the bell skill yeah quarterstaff with the um uh the rapid the rapid

2424
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:08,000
shot uh mercenary skill and when i saw it's like oh man you know that's like it's like a whole other

2425
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:13,000
thing um yeah like that i didn't even know about that about that particular combo uh until i saw it in

2426
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:16,000
the uh some of the footage they recorded i saw yeah i started thinking about that too with like

2427
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:20,000
multiplayer i was like sorry i was throwing my gas grenades oh yeah which you can blow up with your

2428
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:24,000
explosive grenades but then i was throwing it at a boss that was doing burning ground and they were

2429
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:27,000
blowing up instantly i'm like oh wait so it reacts to the environment well it's obviously going to

2430
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:32,000
react to my friends doing oh yes oh yes oh yes and um more friend and this and this is the reason

2431
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:37,000
like this conversation here is the reason why there's going to be crazy builds that we don't

2432
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:41,000
anticipate because like like like like the the some of the stuff that can happen between classes i just

2433
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:46,000
have no doubt we will not have discovered yeah like how much have you really been able to test i mean we

2434
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:50,000
i mean like we we do test party play all the time like mark's mark mark's like

2435
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:57,000
i'm the support character player yeah now i'm like freezing armor breaking putting down clouds slowly

2436
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:01,000
you know i'm like holy there's just a lot going on all of a sudden i'm not just standing there like

2437
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:06,000
i've got buffs coming out of me you know it's like uh you know you're like i'm actually doing all this

2438
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:10,000
active support and like different conditions to synergize with the group and how can it's like okay

2439
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:14,000
you're doing that skill okay what i'm going to do is i'm going to just do this and enhance my armor

2440
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:18,000
breaking and go ballistic armor breaking and you just spam your thing that consumes it

2441
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:24,000
you know so you get a lot of that stuff going on for sure where um all right but you know it

2442
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:28,000
it's kind of honestly the terrifying part as well where it's like

2443
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:34,000
you know what do we have we had the whole like vulnerability curse with with gas cloud ticks or

2444
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:39,000
something and it was like literally applying armor break like every frame and so you have the monsters

2445
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:43,000
going ting ting ting ting ting ting ting and then you have some other thing you have some other guy consuming

2446
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:48,000
it and again oh my god quill rain just don't even how many bloody synergistic things with quill rain

2447
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:52,000
you can do a lot with that all the lightning arrows on the ground and because they can you

2448
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:55,000
know lightning things hit them and explode and all of a sudden now you're just everyone's running

2449
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:00,000
around with core rain spamming lightning rods everywhere and yeah and frost wall somehow frost

2450
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:05,000
wall we had about 15 abuse cases and i mean that's historically accurate yeah

2451
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,000
kinetic blast frost walls and all that

2452
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:14,000
it returns sounds like it's coming back it's it'll be fun yeah it's cool even finding all the

2453
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:19,000
stuff so far has been really fun but yeah i generally play multiplayer most of the alpha i've done is

2454
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:24,000
being in multiplayer play with other people um it's good to get a lot of that testing in there as well

2455
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:30,000
because not a lot of others do it that's really good um and then yeah try and see what we can break

2456
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:37,000
just for good fun um honestly the thing that's like hard is to then like because you get this thing which is

2457
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:42,000
quite interesting where you have a staff is both the player and a developer and i'm of the like

2458
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:47,000
don't you you better not keep that x that you know something that's i wouldn't say exploit but you

2459
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:52,000
know something that's op a secret right you better bloody tell me because that reaction you had earlier

2460
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,000
you were saying people weren't telling you about exactly like you get a situation someone doesn't

2461
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
want to tell you about their build that's because they're like oh mark will nerf it then

2462
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:06,000
you're supposed to be making games i legitimately had a monday meeting and you know whatever

2463
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:11,000
i was like i was like i swear if i see any of you at the top of the ladder on day one we're going to

2464
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:19,000
have a talk exactly exactly exactly no i did tell you about my flashbangs and how good but maybe it's

2465
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:23,000
fine i just don't i just wanted them to check well that's the thing that is hard no one knows if their

2466
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:27,000
thing is actually bro look there's a line that gets crossed yes yeah but sometimes you don't know is it just

2467
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:31,000
i've found something cool and it's powerful or have i found something cool and it's broken

2468
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:36,000
you know and and those things i mean we have to make those decisions of course and a lot of the

2469
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:41,000
time what is reported is just fine and it's like yeah you've you got a good weapon and you got the

2470
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:45,000
right you got this combo you you're strong if it's if it's supported by items then it's like fine to be

2471
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:48,000
very powerful but if you're just like i just pick these skills and no matter what weapons i'm wearing

2472
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:52,000
i'm just like completely ridiculous then that's a different situation because now it's just a thing that

2473
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
anyone can do at a moment's notice rather than actually requiring like you know oh i have to find the big

2474
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:00,000
you know this combo of items and things like that that so that's a much different story um

2475
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:05,000
yeah but now we've had a lot of good testing a lot of good feedback a lot of good um people reporting

2476
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
that stuff especially in the last like month it's like coming in a lot because there's the systems and

2477
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:14,000
everything's kind of stabilizing you start to get a lot more of that when and people are understanding

2478
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:20,000
what the uh difficulties meant to be and what the power of characters is meant to be as all of that came

2479
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:24,000
and started to stabilize we got a lot more of this coming in and we are kind of getting more

2480
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:30,000
understanding but again you'll never find them all but uh you know it's fun good fun journey

2481
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:35,000
support gems have changed a lot however you found the changes to them being now no having no levels

2482
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:40,000
and uh the restriction of having only one support gem on your character of a type but having a lot

2483
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:44,000
more of them i really like how this works like i think that it adds so much more build diversity and

2484
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:49,000
interest um to have to be making the decision of like you know where is this going to go and the

2485
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:53,000
thing that's been important though with that system is it requires a lot more support gems to exist

2486
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:57,000
because you need because you don't have one on your character you need you need tons of them and

2487
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:00,000
like you need like you need a lot of different ways to increase damage and a lot of ways to

2488
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,000
different support different mechanics it's like if you're going to have something like freeze like

2489
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:06,000
you know if you're going to have a freezing skill you need to be able to support that and augment

2490
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:11,000
that in like many different ways and there needs to be more options than what you can even like

2491
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:15,000
there needs to be in order to have choice you can't just have five here's your five freeze things

2492
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:18,000
and that's all you do right there has to be more than that in order to be able to have it so you

2493
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:23,000
actually have some choices as well so uh that kind of stuff has meant that you just need a lot of things going on there

2494
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:27,000
but i think that um the choices that you end up with as a player of like you know where do i put my

2495
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
model projectiles where do i put my ps whatever like i think that leads to a lot more interesting

2496
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:38,000
decisions um with how you build and um uh you know like uh yeah i think that that to me is where a lot

2497
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:43,000
of the why it just works so much better and we were certainly hesitant about the whole um you know

2498
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:47,000
you can only have one support per um character thing because it sounds bad if you just hear about it as

2499
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:51,000
a player without actually playing it like your first reaction is you just hear that and you're like oh it's just a

2500
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:54,000
restriction and it is arbitrary in some sense right there's no like

2501
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:59,000
we can't justify it thematically really um it's just a it's just it just is what it is and so

2502
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,000
that i really don't like that kind of thing usually because um i if i'm gonna i want the

2503
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:08,000
theme to match the mechanic as much as possible but in this case it just made the gameplay so much

2504
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:14,000
better that um like it just had to happen um so arguably if you if you need to like if you end up in a

2505
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:18,000
situation where you like i have to put the support on every slot exactly that that is less

2506
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
choice and that's the reason why the gameplay is less choice less interest and also you may as

2507
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:26,000
well just bake that now into the skills and or 100 and so this is the thing it is actually much

2508
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:31,000
worse to have that because it results in this outcome but like that's a kind of more subtle

2509
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:35,000
argument that's like you have to kind of make to people if you want to kind of convince them this

2510
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:39,000
is actually the right way um because when you tell people oh there's this restriction it doesn't

2511
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:42,000
sound like what they're getting out of that is more choice it sounds like they're getting less

2512
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:46,000
um but the reality is it is actually more choice because you no longer have like mandatory uh like here's the

2513
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:50,000
here's the five mandatory things you have to put on the skill um it's like there's actually much more

2514
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:55,000
going on i think it's much better helped realize my experience on the mercenary that you uh your

2515
02:39:55,000 --> 02:40:01,000
vision of uh having like all of these skills available to you and them actually being worth

2516
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:05,000
using for sure because if you had all the same support gems i feel like you just pick the one that

2517
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:08,000
does the most damage and you make it do the most damage and that's the only skill you use yeah and

2518
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,000
i mean the great thing is is now it's completely reasonable to have a skill in your character that

2519
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:15,000
you just use occasionally right like every five minutes you might have a situation where you need to use

2520
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:19,000
that and that's actually fine and completely reasonable yeah so i'm playing a grenader and i

2521
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:23,000
would be like okay i should only use this grenade normally is what i would be like in part of exile

2522
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:27,000
because this is the best grenade or maybe this one that does like interacts with it in some way

2523
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:32,000
the obvious combo but now i'm actually like well there's a reason i i could use those lightning

2524
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,000
ones to apply a shock because i have all these shock support gems that i'm not using anywhere else

2525
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:41,000
because i'm using the damage and the lmp on my big damage dealers i can use i can put the shock

2526
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:44,000
things on there and i can actually have a shock setup i can incorporate that into my build i can

2527
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:50,000
incorporate poison into my build to strip their armor and whatnot and that actually is something

2528
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:53,000
and maybe you only use that occasionally when you face something that's got heavy armor you know yeah

2529
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:56,000
but it's like you know it's like that that kind of stuff i really want to be viable and that

2530
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:00,000
that situational stuff i think just makes the game way more interesting it's it's really feeding into

2531
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,000
the flavor of the mercenaries like this like prepared kind of fighter who has all these tools at their

2532
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:09,000
disposal as well like you're like i have this grenade for if i get into this situation this grenade for this one

2533
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:15,000
it's so good yeah nice i love it um a couple questions here people definitely been asking

2534
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:18,000
about like vile skills and transfigured gems and stuff and like that i feel like this sort of thing

2535
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:22,000
doesn't make sense at launch exactly yeah because ultimately if we're going to add something like

2536
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,000
that it would make sense to add it um just as another skill um so at this point there's no real

2537
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:29,000
reason to do that like that kind of stuff comes in where we want to have a specific reward system

2538
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:33,000
somewhere that wants to be able to do that and so we don't really need to do it right now but um

2539
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,000
yeah look we might decide to bring that theme back and you know in a reward system

2540
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:41,000
yeah i think for vile skills especially it's a it's a cool flavor yeah for sure um but i think

2541
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:44,000
the transfigured thing is also interesting like uh you know if you're looking to be able to like

2542
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:47,000
the reason why transfigured was nice is because it's like we got to sort of iterate on a bunch

2543
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:52,000
of different themes around the same skill um which uh obviously at this point we don't need to do that

2544
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:57,000
because we've got we're already still adding the skills you know what i mean so uh all the iterations

2545
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:01,000
of it like less of a necessary thing but um yeah i mean i'm look i'm sure we'll be doing more stuff

2546
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:05,000
like that in the future like we absolutely will be do you know how many skills roughly you have

2547
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:10,000
such are going to um end up with some you know um i actually don't know the number off the top of

2548
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:14,000
my head but what i will say is is that we initially i think when we announced like what the full game

2549
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:19,000
would have we said 240 and i'm pretty sure we're actually nearing that i feel definitely it's going

2550
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:22,000
to be way higher than yeah yeah because i think we're nearing that now when we've only added half the

2551
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:27,000
classes so uh i think that that uh means that there's going to be like i know 100 of them or whatever

2552
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:32,000
like some little utility skill or whatever but there's even if you discount for those it's yeah i know

2553
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:37,000
no no that's a lot yeah you got what like because there's 20 there's 20 to 25 for each of those uh

2554
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:42,000
for each class um so just with six of those i'm terrible at math in my head um but i feel like

2555
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:51,000
that's 120 well let's let's say it's just a bit over um 110 or something like end up around there 120

2556
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:56,000
something like that uh around yeah i think probably 120 um around there um like that but then you've also

2557
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:01,000
got all the buff gems as well and like each character class has nine of those um so that then sort of

2558
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:05,000
adds up so you've already reached uh probably 200 just by the time you've got to there um and then

2559
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:10,000
uh and then it doesn't even count things that really are skills but like are not you don't get them via

2560
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,000
a skill gem um so like we're talking about all the ascendancy little skills and there's like uniques

2561
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:20,000
that have little skill things on them all all staffs wands and yeah exactly we're not even counting

2562
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:24,000
that right like so the staffs wands and sceptors have skills built in yeah uh and then those are like

2563
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:29,000
that's another how many of those are there's like 20 of those probably yeah i mean like if you add them all

2564
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:34,000
up i don't know who remembers all these things i know but there's no one has counted recently

2565
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:43,000
but uh there's a bunch countless um yeah yeah um ascendancy classes with skills yeah yeah yeah

2566
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:48,000
and those skills those skills by the way ascendancy class skills are fully supportable yeah yeah

2567
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:51,000
that's wild because i remember you did the thing with the fault attack where you can support that

2568
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:55,000
now you can support the fault attack um and you can support any skill that comes from something

2569
02:43:55,000 --> 02:44:00,000
that one caught me by surprise i was like oh wow you can actually link those up yep it's uh yeah so

2570
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,000
you're gonna end up with quite a lot uh going on there i was even surprised when i was like oh i

2571
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:08,000
can add you know additional accuracy to herald of eyes and it like provides a buff to my character i can

2572
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:14,000
like add buffs through support james well you know why that is though because uh those those things like

2573
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:18,000
heralds are so hard to find like a good set of supports to recommend so we're like damn we have to come

2574
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:23,000
up with like tons of these now they're like really difficult you can like create a custom aura yeah absolutely absolutely

2575
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:28,000
so yeah it's um that that actually means it's actually nice because um part of the um it means

2576
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:32,000
that you get the feeling of having more aura effects on your character without having to have the spam of

2577
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:37,000
actual auras that um every many characters had in pwe1 like you get to kind of have all that stuff as

2578
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:45,000
well um so uh that's that's been really nice thanks for the uh invisible or mtx well it does remind me

2579
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:50,000
though um so with all this is very off topic but with all the uh very good teasers you've been doing for

2580
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:56,000
like new 3d art for uniques and stuff like that have you had any thoughts about uh reworking um

2581
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:02,000
the transfer skin transfer mtx in some way making it more permanent um honestly it's not an hour

2582
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:06,000
thing about stuff we're thinking about you know like it'll work the same way it works for now at least

2583
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,000
uh but obviously uh skin transfer and peewee 2 there's a lot more cool base art yeah that's

2584
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
going to make people actually want to use it now i feel so yeah you'll probably be using that a lot more

2585
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:19,000
so yeah it'd be cool to see something for that in the future potentially um so on to the end game which was

2586
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:27,000
i feel like a big bulk of the announcement for sure yeah um so just as like an overview so we have

2587
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:31,000
the end game versions just for beta launch by the way yeah because it's gonna be a lot more later

2588
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:39,000
we have the we have the end game pinnacle versions of the two um trials yep so as like fully farmable

2589
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:43,000
content they don't have trees though those ones they don't have trees but they do have a progression

2590
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:48,000
system of some kind so you've got the relics in um in the sanctum uh sequel and then for the trial of

2591
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:57,000
chaos you have um the uh the inscribed uh ultimatums have getting mods uh uh from from the end so when

2592
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:04,000
you kill the um final um uh the the final boss of that uh which is you know alleged to be the trial master

2593
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:13,000
um then uh you um alleged yeah then uh you know he'll drop uh uh items that can then have mods on them to make the trial itself harder

2594
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:16,000
and there's also some pretty interesting ones on there that we actually were going to put in the video

2595
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:20,000
but it was starting to get a bit long um which was that um you've got the thing which i i uh where

2596
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:26,000
you've got the uh the bets that you can make of like you know uh put up uh you know 13 exalts and

2597
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:30,000
then you might get double that back if you're able to complete the uh thing so those are some of the mods

2598
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:34,000
that can spawn on there um and as well as mods that make the actual trial harder as well so um there's

2599
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:37,000
things like that as well so yeah those two have those kind of like different outside the

2600
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:41,000
outlustry because they're not really part of the atlas like you'll get keys for them while you're playing in game

2601
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:46,000
but technically speaking they're kind of like they they go they scale to end game but they're not

2602
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:51,000
like sort of part of the the whole atlas um yeah like play them there yeah so their own distinct

2603
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:56,000
yeah exactly exactly so there'll be three roguelike dungeon things that will be sure sure sure like

2604
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:02,000
um i wouldn't say three roguelike dungeons i will say there'll be three trials that have various

2605
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:07,000
mechanics that you know can be different yeah but uh then then of course you've got the um uh four kind

2606
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:11,000
of what i guess would say sort of um i don't we actually need a name for what what

2607
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:15,000
what are we calling what are we calling the things that are icons on the on the on the

2608
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:18,000
because they were called leagues but they're not really yeah it doesn't really make sense to call

2609
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:21,000
it a league exactly that is what we call them internally we just refer to them as like there

2610
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:28,000
are four leagues that you uh have that appear there doesn't really work um uh i don't have a good idea

2611
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:32,000
right now yeah we probably have actually named it i just don't remember what it is right right

2612
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:37,000
and then you've got uh the kind of boss hunting kind of element as well uh and then the kind of i guess

2613
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:40,000
what you would say is the pinnacle of the kind of boss hunting thing is then you know you've got the cities

2614
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:45,000
with the lieutenants and then the uber act bosses and then above that you have the pinnacle boss who

2615
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:50,000
we don't want to spoil um although i did uh show you a little bit about it uh just in private uh

2616
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:55,000
before um but uh yeah that's uh that one's gonna be that one's gonna be hard like uh i know you're

2617
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:01,000
you're cooking up some pretty difficult uh mechanics there um yeah it's fun i asked that's the fun stuff

2618
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:04,000
mm-hmm yeah because now you don't need to worry about if people can't progress through it's not a

2619
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:10,000
progression blocker you can just kill them yeah it's a progression it's a progression blocker to

2620
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:13,000
uh difficulty uh to the higher difficulties though because yeah once you once you kill that of course

2621
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:17,000
then you get the increase of the difficulties and then it's like okay now try it again but way harder

2622
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:21,000
and then you know like and then there's four there's four levels of difficulty for each of those um for

2623
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:26,000
each end game system like that so yeah like apart from the trials the end game trials everything has

2624
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:32,000
like its own distinct passive tree and progression through them is also by doing them yes exactly yeah so we

2625
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:36,000
really wanted to prevent the situation where you feel like you um allocate points for a certain

2626
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:40,000
piece of content and then you feel like you can't do the other content because you're kind of wasting

2627
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:44,000
the points that you've got yeah the lock-in and uh we kind of uh band-aided that and here we won by

2628
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:47,000
adding multiple atlas trees as a way but i think the solution is much better where effectively you can

2629
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:51,000
progress all of them and you can either do like you know just all in one for a while or you can just

2630
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:55,000
like you know do each of them as you come to them and you know just add them kind of piecemeal um

2631
02:48:55,000 --> 02:49:00,000
but either way however you want to do it um you know you can make progress progress on your character um well i

2632
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:04,000
should say in your league uh uh for all for all of those um because uh the progress and all that

2633
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:08,000
stuff is of course um you know for the whole league not just for a single character yeah and previously

2634
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:14,000
we used the atlas tree i would say very much so to make sure that we were doing the type of content

2635
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:17,000
that we wanted to do yeah so now it's not so much about finding the content because that's what the

2636
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:25,000
tablets are for yeah now it's more about um improving your ability to um like uh uh sustain effectively

2637
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:28,000
like you you're going to want to have those points to sort of get sustainability for the next level up and

2638
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:32,000
we want to make sure that there is sustain if you're doing you know engaging with those mechanics

2639
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:37,000
well yeah but effectively you do have to actually like to to get sustain at higher difficulties um

2640
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:40,000
you will need to be able to you know be making smart choices in terms of allocating and like

2641
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:44,000
using the tablets correctly and that kind of stuff um like it is part of that sort of story of all of

2642
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:49,000
that um so um yeah that's the that's kind of the main thing with that yeah this idea of like

2643
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:53,000
sustaining the content you want to do by doing it is a little different to how it's been in period one a

2644
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:57,000
lot of time where it's like sure you had to fuel it by going back to maps right right right

2645
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:00,000
yeah get your old juice i mean you're still doing maps ultimately yeah in terms of like

2646
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:05,000
yeah but but effectively like so long as you're doing the content that you um uh that you that

2647
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:09,000
you want to do you should and as well and making it harder um you know so your build has to be good

2648
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:12,000
enough to be able to to be able to sustain it as well then then you will be able to sustain that stuff

2649
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:16,000
and you know uh like if you want every single map to have a breach in it that's absolutely doable

2650
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:23,000
um by uh by by by you know using the tablets correctly yeah so the um atlas passive trees and the

2651
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:27,000
trees for each of the distinct types of content is about scaling the reward and

2652
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:33,000
difficulty primarily yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely um and what does i saw like on the breach nodes it

2653
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:40,000
said like increased difficulty what does that mean um it's somewhat arbitrary and asymmetric but um it

2654
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:46,000
will feel like for example some of the difficulties will actually change the boss's skills and how they

2655
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:52,000
work um generally they'll increase like the level of the area right so you get the general uh monster and

2656
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:57,000
life scaling um but arguably to a player that's arbitrary as well because they don't know how that scales

2657
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:04,000
um uh and another context here might be more of certain monster types less of others and stuff like

2658
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:11,000
that um it is generally uh that yeah so the small nodes will increase difficulty of the meta content

2659
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:17,000
whereas the large the notables will increase the reward of the in-map content um but when i say difficulty

2660
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:24,000
that is reward as well so an example of how this works is like um let's say the boss has six uniques

2661
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:31,000
it could drop or five or six uniques um it can drop three at difficulty zero then at say um difficulty

2662
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:38,000
one it can drop you know maybe has increased level or higher item level um some rarity um you know now

2663
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:45,000
also that when i say rarity also do note rarity does increase the grade of items not just making

2664
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:51,000
them yellow or orange it does make them better yellows or better or no not better oranges um

2665
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:56,000
it does affect yeah it affects other things about items than just the rarity yes um and so yeah when

2666
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:00,000
i talk about just getting rarity here i don't want people to and peewee one players in particular to

2667
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:05,000
think ah they're just going to go from yellow to more yellow um so anyway and you know maybe the next

2668
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:11,000
tier will add a unique to the pool like a more uh you know what we hope will be more valuable unique

2669
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:16,000
and then the next one can do a bit more rarity something else maybe introduce a different unique

2670
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:23,000
perhaps and then the last difficulty introduces something ideally you know without giving away

2671
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:31,000
exact specifics of them more in the line of a um modular unique item say like megalomaniac or like

2672
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:37,000
um forbidden flesh and flame from peewee one so a unique item that is like ideally very powerful very

2673
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:43,000
chase um but uh has a lot of different combinations watchers eyes another good example right so a new

2674
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:48,000
series of jewels um is a good example there are other uniques that are modular and stuff and that

2675
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:53,000
comes in at the last tier and so you want to really be getting to that hardest difficulty so you can be

2676
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:59,000
getting these like farming for these extremely good powerful unique items um but of course you have

2677
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:03,000
the thing if you're never ready for it if you try it and you're like oh this is too hard you can

2678
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:08,000
always just respect the nodes yeah you can unspec them away and uh then not you know like uh just

2679
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:12,000
effectively decide like i've got these points but um i'm not yeah yeah i want to go back and do this

2680
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:16,000
later and so that ability to effectively configure the difficulty like that i think so if you're maybe

2681
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:20,000
target farming one of the base one of the uniques the difficulty zero drops you might want to just be

2682
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:25,000
like i'll do that i'll do the difficulty stuff later and i'll just farm it at this difficulty so and i

2683
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:29,000
think that's a much better way than the than some of the systems we've used to scale that in the past and

2684
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:33,000
the nice thing is of course the difficulty is that we can effectively get what use whatever scaling

2685
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:37,000
levers we want to make that more difficult without necessarily having like like because we could

2686
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:40,000
have been like oh you know you increase difficulty it's like 200 life or something like that but by

2687
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:44,000
effectively being a bit more vague about it we can actually like specifically tailor the difficulties

2688
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:48,000
yeah different tiers like you know with more specific changes yeah this like multiple projectile

2689
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:51,000
thingy shoots has more projectiles sure and that kind of thing so you know whatever we feel works

2690
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:55,000
best for making this particular fight more difficult it seems like there's a lot more for players to

2691
02:53:55,000 --> 02:54:01,000
kind of discover experimentally there as they progress for sure in what way they're getting harder and that um

2692
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:05,000
it's going to be different for different players too where like a different build is affected by a

2693
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:10,000
difficulty change more so potentially and uh that that's an interesting question as well i think

2694
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:15,000
where how much are you guys pitching these sorts of distinct end game pieces of content at being like

2695
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:21,000
completable by the same build or by encouraging players to make a different build that's better at

2696
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:26,000
so this is this is a very difficult one um and uh it's something that we've discussed a bit recently is like

2697
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:31,000
like the harder you make the hardest content the less builds will be considered viable by the players

2698
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:36,000
because um effectively like a build's only viable if it can defeat like you know the the pinnacle boss

2699
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:41,000
at difficulty four like that will be kind of the general perception so we have to be really like i

2700
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:46,000
actually don't know necessarily what the right answer here is um like we uh have the ability i mean maybe

2701
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:51,000
you feel like you do but i don't think i i wouldn't say i'm 100 confident on it but like you know

2702
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:57,000
i'll i'll i'll have a go at it look there's going to be iteration here because what we'll see is like

2703
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:02,000
you know if we find that like um you know there's only like some particularly abusive like only the

2704
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:05,000
most abusive stuff is possibly able to defeat the hardest content that we might have to dial it back

2705
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:09,000
a bit yeah um but it's kind of going to be a bit of experimentation and it's very hard at this point

2706
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:14,000
to be able to pitch that because we don't have the um crazy history you know pwee does not have the

2707
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:19,000
history of pwee one to be able to you know to know kind of what like what is the right life value to have

2708
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:25,000
on a difficulty four pinnacle boss like yeah how do we even know that at this point really without

2709
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:30,000
that being said though like the bosses are a lot more skill based and tactical right like at the end

2710
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:38,000
of the day uh the gear is to some degree necessary because no one can really make no mistake for some

2711
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:42,000
amount of time you know so you do have that thing and you do need to mitigate certain things but like

2712
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:49,000
a lot of these are like very dodge roll tactical um or using different certain skills or mitigation tactics

2713
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:53,000
or whatever you do there's heaps of different things to bypass the things that make them hard

2714
02:55:53,000 --> 02:56:00,000
for sure but i would say it is very much a lot of skill is involved um especially when it comes to

2715
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:06,000
some of these with dodge rolling like i'm trying to emphasize that quite a bit um or blocking you

2716
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:10,000
know if you want to do a different way about it um not to say you must block but yes dodge roll is a

2717
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:14,000
pretty key mechanic here and i'd say we're certainly upping the emphasis on using and using it well as you

2718
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:20,000
get into these higher tiers but gear is always a way and combinations of uniques and passive tree

2719
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:25,000
and build is always a way to go i'm not good at dodge rolling i'm going to gear around that skill

2720
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:30,000
check and become strong enough to defeat the boss you know or another skill like a some sort of skill

2721
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:35,000
that helps you block using skills in the mix is fine yeah but i would say pretty generally you can

2722
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:41,000
take i'd say any decent character you get pretty damn you gear up all the way and as long as you're good

2723
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:45,000
enough that is a way to defeat them i would say there's no real hard requirement on doing something

2724
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:49,000
crazy niche or out there or complicated you're certainly not going the route of like oh this

2725
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:55,000
boss is fire immune or something oh no no no no no thanks no no we've been through that already yeah

2726
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:04,000
excellent um so this uh this very cute atlas this infinitely expanding civilization map-esque

2727
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:10,000
atlas which i know you're particularly fond of jonathan yep um uh what's the uh what's kind of the

2728
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:15,000
idea here like is the layout the same for everyone is it the same across the league um so it's the same

2729
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:19,000
for all your characters in the league but the layout is different for everyone it is random okay so you're

2730
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:22,000
gonna have to find stuff like it works like delve in this respect which is obviously a league that i

2731
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:28,000
was particularly a fan of yeah um so um yeah i'm just a really i i what i really wanted is i wanted a

2732
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:35,000
feeling of exploration um in the atlas and um it's something that we sort of tried to do with the atlas

2733
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:39,000
and here we won with that feeling of kind of you know having the connected areas and exploring but it never

2734
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:44,000
really it didn't feel like exploration quite in quite the same way that this does yeah um so um

2735
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:48,000
that's the thing i loved and it's one of the reasons i love delve um and uh so that's you know kind of

2736
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:54,000
kind of where this was coming from and uh at the same time um it's sort of solving various other

2737
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:58,000
problems that we've always had where um like one of the things that's really cool to do um is to be

2738
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:02,000
able to have things like okay like in this area you've got like this item drops and like that kind

2739
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:06,000
of thing you know like i guess in p1 you had div cards but yet there was always a problem where

2740
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:12,000
if you have differences between in-game areas in a system that works like p1 does then effectively

2741
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:15,000
that's the only map people like like whatever the best map is that's the one everyone will run

2742
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:20,000
like continuously forever um so effectively um we wanted to try and make sure that you actually

2743
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:24,000
like had an experience that had more variety while still retaining the whole like i get to play the

2744
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:29,000
content that i want um so ideally with the with um with the atlas we kind of get that we've got in

2745
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:33,000
p2 we get to kind of have both of the best of both worlds we get to make sure that there is

2746
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:36,000
some variety you know you feel like you're exploring but because once you've run a map

2747
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:40,000
that's run and now you have to you know move on and do it and find another one um it's not just like

2748
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:45,000
the you know like just just play one map again and again and again but yet the content you know can

2749
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:49,000
be added to it um you can do things if you if you like the you know particular maps you know because

2750
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:52,000
there are biomes and you can see them from far away you can be like okay i know there's a particular

2751
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:55,000
desert map that's great so i'm going to go for deserts and that's fine you can do that kind of thing

2752
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:01,000
um so you know like you've you've both got controllability but also um uh you know the ability for us to

2753
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:06,000
kind of make more variants you get a lot more very high satisfying spikes yeah um well like for

2754
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:10,000
example you get more variables where you just have okay there are like four towers really you've got a

2755
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:18,000
good tower cluster and you've got really good maps in in that range so like you know there are maps

2756
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:27,000
so in and perfect so one for example um you know the range is effectively say um how do i quantify this

2757
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:32,000
like say 350 monsters up to 700 monsters yeah whereas the range here is like 300 monsters up to

2758
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:39,000
like uh uh 1500 monsters you know much much much more drastic range now those numbers are arbitrary but

2759
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:44,000
um it is approximately the representation of the range obviously you then modify it and add more to

2760
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:51,000
it and all of that so you will have some maps that are like extremely good with delirium um and some

2761
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:56,000
maps that are like way better with something more like breach yeah because delirium enhances the monsters of

2762
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:02,000
the map whereas breach entirely adds the monsters and you will even have things where there are maps

2763
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:07,000
that are like way more magic monsters way more rare monsters and so you probably want that with you know

2764
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:12,000
pick your league of your choosing and whatnot you have all these variables that are at play and so you

2765
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:17,000
all of a sudden find a really good set of towers with some really good maps and radius and then you'll

2766
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:23,000
get really good tablet modifiers and then you'll get really good maps with really good prefixes and you

2767
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:27,000
want to just combine all of this and to and you obviously instill them all and you corrupt them

2768
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:33,000
all and there's the corruption influence and so then there's a corruption influence on them and it's

2769
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:39,000
like yeah okay like it is possible for this on one map to be many many mechanics stacks to the point of

2770
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:44,000
uh craziness so it sounds like the the juicing is definitely there well yeah i mean that's that's

2771
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:50,000
important right i mean like that that's part of the kiwi experience yeah for 100 but uh

2772
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:55,000
uh how um how much control do you have as a player though over min maxing your just exploration of

2773
03:00:55,000 --> 03:01:01,000
the atlas map so effectively um can you do better in some way um so effectively what you're going to

2774
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:06,000
be want to do is the towers are where you go to like see areas around and then there's the the

2775
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:11,000
structure of the connections is quite open so like you can beeline for things um pretty well like if you

2776
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:15,000
like you can certainly see a lot more maps than what you play if you know what i mean yeah um so uh

2777
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:20,000
because of that um like you know choosing what you want is is is is easy to do and you can kind

2778
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:24,000
of see the towers in the fog yes you can see the towers in the fog from a distance which means that

2779
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:28,000
um you know you don't like a lot of the time it's like you know go to a tower you'll see some maps you

2780
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:31,000
want to play you go play those then it's like the next tower is just a few other maps away go to that

2781
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:35,000
tower see then you see the next area and so on i'm guessing that's like a certain range out you can

2782
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:40,000
see yeah yeah the fog kind of uh in 3d kind of the fog's actually a 3d thing and it like it like

2783
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:44,000
rises slowly as you get away from where the thing is so that's how you kind of get the towers to

2784
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:48,000
oh so you might see a cluster of towers off somewhere yeah absolutely you can see that

2785
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:52,000
it sounds like this is like potentially an infinitely expanding map that is going to be by

2786
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:57,000
the end of someone's league quite big yes um so we haven't we actually need to add a search feature

2787
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:01,000
i don't know if they've done it yet uh for finding specific maps that haven't been run yet yeah we

2788
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:05,000
have a few things there's a button you can press and it like goes to your last map round one that goes

2789
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:10,000
back to a home base and one that goes to some of the special uh you know more iconic things you

2790
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:17,000
find but um this we certainly need more um 100 so that is something we will be working on hopefully

2791
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:24,000
it's there who knows and uh so waystones have a tier but they don't have specific maps on them anymore

2792
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:30,000
which obviously shrinks that whole map pool thing down yes substantially um it'll make the maps dash tab

2793
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:37,000
a little easier to manage yeah so uh yeah so uh have you thought about like what sort of i don't know

2794
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:41,000
economic consequences that have for like how players progress through maps is it easier to

2795
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:44,000
do when you don't have to collect all of these individual maps to get the completion bonuses

2796
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:48,000
and stuff like we do currently like we have that whole you know hunting down over 100 maps to get

2797
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:54,000
completion for i mean yeah now you're hunting you know you're hunting certain valuable maps you're

2798
03:02:54,000 --> 03:03:00,000
hunting towers you're hunting content you're hunting um you know the the warlord the faction leaders to

2799
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:05,000
to get the pinnacle yeah you know you're hunting uh unique maps very different thing for sure

2800
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:11,000
um as opposed to and then the item is all about i've just got a key i just want good modifiers you

2801
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:14,000
know there's not really all that whole other variable to it so there's still a lot of a lot

2802
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:20,000
of interesting choice and axes um but we've taken it from the item and put it on the actual world map

2803
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:24,000
um but it's cool it also makes you just feel like you're traversing a world you know you're not

2804
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:30,000
instantly like finishing the campaign very grounded and now i'm in space you know like public

2805
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:35,000
i only literally just thought about that i was gonna ask about that so you know the mapping system was

2806
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:40,000
always this like extra dimensional kind of unknown thing it's pretty interesting but it is a little

2807
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:44,000
so we wanted to start with actually like at least i mean look i'm sure we'll get to the extra

2808
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:49,000
dimensional beings eventually but um but at least to start with you know we wanted to have a bit more

2809
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:55,000
grounded initially yes you're on the planet yeah right you're on the planet that's like a good thing

2810
03:03:55,000 --> 03:04:04,000
we have not we haven't gone to the moon yet yes well even then we were saying like can we at least at

2811
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:10,000
least before we go to outer space go to the moon first like well actually well how many moons are

2812
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:14,000
we don't we know there's there's a whole complicated thing we need to figure out there wow

2813
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
i feel like there's a delve but up league coming

2814
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:25,000
all right so we've got this uh one in four maps is boss maps and then the other that means the other

2815
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:30,000
three are not boss maps yes what does a non-boss map look like how do you win it so effectively what you

2816
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:35,000
need to do is um kill the uh kill the rares um in the map to just to remove the corruption and finish

2817
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:40,000
it um once you get down below 50 monsters it will point out uh any rares that are remaining there's a

2818
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:44,000
little marker just so you know uh but honestly i wouldn't expect that to even be necessary most of

2819
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:47,000
the time because the layouts are kind of designed so that you know like you know if you generally

2820
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:50,000
speaking you want to clear the maps to find the rares anyway because those are the one you know

2821
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:55,000
those have good drops um and effectively um the the only reason that you would need that marker

2822
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:59,000
thing is just occasionally you get some slightly weird degenerate layout where there's some side bit you didn't

2823
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
notice or something like that and that's like that's where you have to go so generally speaking

2824
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:05,000
you'll be able to make your way around and kill them all the goal of the player is you're cleansing

2825
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:10,000
corruption from the world you're bringing water back um you know stuff like that so you even get

2826
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:14,000
the thing on the map where you're like you know there's some corruption-y looking stuff around the

2827
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:19,000
map when you complete the map that gets purged away um you know so you feel like you're reverse

2828
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:24,000
painting the map a little bit we're cleaning up yeah it can actually be quite satisfying as you're like

2829
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:28,000
changing all the nodes from one color to another and you're like yeah this is fun i'm like you know

2830
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:32,000
but the ultimately what we wanted to do is um we wanted boss combat and poe 2 to matter when we

2831
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:38,000
have it yeah and so in order like if you have a map uh boss every area then if we made it so the

2832
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:42,000
boss combat mattered enough like in order to actually balance it that way stressful it's it's too much

2833
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:47,000
like it actually is like you know you you spend too much of your time fighting bosses yeah um so

2834
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:51,000
effectively if that's what you want to do now you can do it because there's bosses there you know

2835
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:54,000
like when i say one of four maps is a map boss that doesn't mean that one for maps you play as one

2836
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:57,000
um because you know obviously you can pick what content you're doing by exploring around

2837
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:01,000
you're picking your path and your path exactly so effectively if you want to hunt the bosses then

2838
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:05,000
that is the thing you can do um if you want to just like do some mindless grinding for a while

2839
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:09,000
uh you can do that too and what it means is we can actually make the bosses way more rewarding

2840
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:12,000
uh they can drop way more items than they were going to because of the fact that there's not one at the

2841
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:17,000
end of every area right like and then and the fight is substantial you get a lot of drops um so uh

2842
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:21,000
that actually is something and they get their own tree and they what oh yeah i don't know right you

2843
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:25,000
mean the boss the boss killing tree yes there's a tree for boss hunting sorry i thought you meant every boss had

2844
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:28,000
its own tree and i was like geez but did you do some design while i wasn't doing well i was looking

2845
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:34,000
not yet not yet josh was like wait no wait stop it's too much that's like a year three feature

2846
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:40,000
yeah okay okay we'll get that in mind um yeah yeah so there's actually like a i i do love that there's

2847
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:44,000
a boss hunting because i'm super into that there's a boss hunting tree that you can fill out as well so

2848
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:49,000
how do you get points on that like yeah so effectively i mean well you can um you get a lot of points for the

2849
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:54,000
core tree there's a core tree that affects all mapping um that all the things like pack size

2850
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:59,000
quantity rarity and you've got multiple keystones that um all work can work together and all can

2851
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:05,000
do so i think there's three of them uh one plays on like corrupted maps one plays on like prefixes and

2852
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:09,000
suffixes and i can't remember what the other ones other one does right in this very moment um but

2853
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:15,000
you obviously get that core tree and then you have you know a boss tree and then obviously all the

2854
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:21,000
different league and pinnacle content trees so you get those points by just completing maps it just

2855
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:27,000
has a um you effectively get a quest um and effectively it's like you complete 10 maps you

2856
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:33,000
get your first two points and then like complete x maps and one you know but of certain tiers like

2857
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:37,000
yeah at least tier one at least tier two at least tier three climb effectively where it's like as you

2858
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:41,000
get up the higher tiers and clear maps of certain tiers that's when you start getting points for the

2859
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:47,000
at like may say the third one i um i can't remember the exact specifics it's like complete this and

2860
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:52,000
defeat a boss or and then later it's defeat at least five bosses at something and you know so

2861
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:55,000
killing bosses get generally it sounds way better for a start so i'm not having to like go and get

2862
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:59,000
that estuary map that i missed or something yeah oh yeah for sure i'm just i'm just doing content

2863
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:04,000
but it is kind of the analog of that in a way because like it's that feeling of like i've got a

2864
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:07,000
system to progress through like i just need to i need to meet these objectives and definitely

2865
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:10,000
got a lot of i'm getting and i'm getting from that you're getting the um you know the atlas uh

2866
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:15,000
the atlas passive points and so on um so yeah that's kind of the idea yeah so you can really

2867
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:21,000
like focus in on map blasting with the bossless maps and or you know or on bossing content if you want

2868
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:26,000
to or on breaches or and you can always put a breach on a map with a boss right you can do both

2869
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:30,000
yeah like they can have all they can have you can have you can have every type of content in one map

2870
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:36,000
if you want yeah is like a boss map a kind of like a distinct thing from like a regular map in terms of

2871
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:42,000
like the the layout or the thing you've done technically they are separate but generally

2872
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:46,000
speaking um like they're like similar yeah they're basically the same they're pretty similar

2873
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:49,000
they're pretty similar so they'll be like a boss history and a non-boss history yeah there are there

2874
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:53,000
are some cases at the moment where there are some maps that can't have a boss um and because just we

2875
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:58,000
haven't done the you know the the one that would go here is not in early access yet and that kind

2876
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:03,000
of thing but effectively um you know it as i said generally speaking it'll be one and four that you'll find

2877
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:10,000
um okay excellent um so i think i think that covers did i miss some things from you've got

2878
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:15,000
like the all the smaller contents like the strong boxes and essences yeah yeah so initially we actually

2879
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:19,000
had a design where everything um like even all the smaller content there was still going to be icons

2880
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:23,000
for it on the tree as around the atlas yeah but we actually found that it meant that when you were

2881
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:27,000
actually exploring it didn't kind of it felt like there was nothing random to find so we wanted to

2882
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:30,000
make sure we also have kind of just completely random stuff that like doesn't have a progression

2883
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:33,000
system that you just run into randomly because that's fun too and i will probably be adding more

2884
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:37,000
stuff like that as well over time that's just like just the i randomly encountered this and that was

2885
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:41,000
like not expected so that's all the stuff on the core atlas tree yeah so you can kind of like see

2886
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:47,000
more of that if you want yeah yeah yep great and and often mods on the items as well on map

2887
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:52,000
keep waystones yeah cool yep lots of different names maps waystone same thing

2888
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:58,000
yes i've had to keep thinking kind of correcting myself about that i was like yeah i don't know

2889
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:03,000
i mean internally we cut we definitely call them maps all the time uh the thing is is the

2890
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:06,000
only reason why it doesn't make sense thematically is because a map does imply it's of a specific

2891
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:11,000
location whereas a waste can take you to anywhere yeah so that's the reason why if the name change

2892
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:14,000
had to happen but i think that probably even players will probably just call them maps i bet

2893
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:21,000
just because you know if that's the period um so we've got we've got the breach delirium ritual

2894
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:27,000
expedition those like leagues that maybe need a new name yeah um is there another one that you're just

2895
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:31,000
both personally really keen to bring back in the future oh i mean you know like i've always wanted

2896
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:36,000
to have uh delve again but i kind of got a bit of that wish with the system yeah it's also a very

2897
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:40,000
uh like like content heavy league to make because you need to make tons of encounters and like

2898
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:45,000
doing it properly is a huge thing but um i mean look i'm i i love incursion as well it's one of my

2899
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:48,000
favorites like i'm keen for that i don't know if there's anything you other than that you're really

2900
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:53,000
keen for there's a lot especially because there's a lot i can do with we can do with all this new

2901
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:57,000
art new monsters new monsters right like for example if you just take legion legion had all

2902
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:03,000
those five civilizations we've now got an entire new array of vile monsters vile bosses etc that we

2903
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:10,000
can use as a baseline we've got way better consistent direction on what's going on there up you know heaps

2904
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:15,000
of stuff new animation and the capacities are just like out of control but then you've got

2905
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:21,000
okay incursion we've got you know awesome vile artwork we can use there and make that all awesome and

2906
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:25,000
nice um new corruption mechanics that we can extrapolate on you don't want to have a roof

2907
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:31,000
as the boss anymore no you're not just gonna have a floating roof the omnitex is just a small

2908
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:35,000
floating roof oh you're keeping with the theme of vacuum cleaners

2909
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:42,000
look standing and then the states were made now we have minimum like that's a world where you have

2910
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:46,000
super uniques with one or two skills yeah yeah right i don't there's only so much you can do with a

2911
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:53,000
floating roof so anyway and then um i don't know even like bestiary coming back with something

2912
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:58,000
because we've got all these like awesome bosses way grander in scale and you can do these more grand

2913
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:02,000
hunts for them as opposed to just like oh i'm like in a city and there's a rare spider you know

2914
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:09,000
you can just get way way more epic and way more um you know involved and with all the new art

2915
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:15,000
and so much stuff to like bestiary 2 that's like hunting big beasts and preparing for them and tracking them

2916
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:21,000
that'd be pretty cool exactly i'd definitely take some mercenary action to that

2917
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:28,000
good fit i feel all right well there's lots for us to look forward to there you have some kind of like

2918
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:33,000
penned already for adding to the beta i mean we all plans can change but uh they're absolutely i mean

2919
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:37,000
look that we've we've we've done things like commissioning art assets and so on like we've got

2920
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:41,000
stuff coming along it's just question of like you know when we actually get there what's it going to

2921
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:46,000
look like yep all right um let's talk about crafting a little bit because you've done a lot

2922
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:52,000
there and it's uh pretty fundamental to the game i think um so what's the core of what you're trying

2923
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:56,000
to do with crafting in part of exile 2 compared to part of exile 1 uh kind of noting that you've

2924
03:12:56,000 --> 03:13:02,000
really kind of stepped back from the idea of like reforging an item many times or scouring it

2925
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:06,000
so um we really want to make it so that you're you're finding crafting items all the time you're using

2926
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:10,000
those crafting items way more often than you were in pwe1 um that you know you like the the just the

2927
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:15,000
the game of like picking something up like seeing what i could modify it to like then actually equipping

2928
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:18,000
those items is just happening way more often and there's so many subtle changes around this like in

2929
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:25,000
terms of um uh just like the way that the way that the base mods scale and items and the you know

2930
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:28,000
like things like that like all the stuff to kind of make it so that um as you find new base types and

2931
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:33,000
new things like you've got a reason to craft them you know part of that is making sure that um you know

2932
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:37,000
you've got enough of that currency um you know it's it actually took us a long time to even get

2933
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:41,000
comfortable with the idea of making something like an exalt drop that often because there's just this

2934
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:46,000
thing in your cemented in your mind of like um you know oh this is this is rare right like it's an

2935
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:50,000
exalt how can it possibly drop like you know multiple times in act one um you know like it just it

2936
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:58,000
just seems crazy um but uh with the way like removing scouring affected so much of the way that we

2937
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:02,000
can craft like i know that you noted earlier that um you can uh there's so many more things you're

2938
03:14:02,000 --> 03:14:06,000
allowed to craft now that you weren't allowed to before relics yes and the reason why that's

2939
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:11,000
allowed is because without scouring um like those crafts become one time things which means that

2940
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:14,000
it's actually okay to allow for that stuff and i think that's opened up a huge amount of um stuff

2941
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:18,000
you know there's just yeah there's so many more types that can add so much more valuable value to

2942
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:25,000
the dropped exactly exactly so um that stuff is just i think opened up a huge amount there and um it

2943
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:28,000
also has and this wasn't necessarily an explicit goal right at the beginning but it's also meant that

2944
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:33,000
the the the the the game of like i'm just going to click click click click click again and again

2945
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:38,000
as my crafting session is no longer really the meta just spam rolling yeah exactly like everything

2946
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:42,000
kind of is something that you want to be able to use um you are still reforging and metacrafting

2947
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:46,000
things oh yeah yeah we've still got stuff like that right we've got a nulls and yes but that stuff

2948
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:51,000
is higher up like that that's kind of more of a of a later game thing yeah exactly um because you

2949
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:56,000
have to think about it after each time like will i improve this will i make it worse yeah um so uh yeah

2950
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:59,000
yeah there's stuff to do there and like you know like the metacrafting that um omens can do

2951
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:02,000
yeah um is also very interesting like there's some pretty powerful stuff there but once again we

2952
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:07,000
introduce that stuff later on and so effectively we want to uh you know i guess for lack of better

2953
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:11,000
democratize crafting at early levels like make sure that uh everyone's able to do that stuff um

2954
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:15,000
while having the more advanced stuff be kind of a little bit later we certainly had a goal at one

2955
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:19,000
point where i was like we're talking with rishi and i'm like if ever it's every single time we're

2956
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:26,000
doing alpha wipes or getting the stuff to play i am like if i am not seeing and hearing about people using exalts

2957
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:31,000
during act one then we have failed and we need to drop more of them and so we ended up like i

2958
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:35,000
would say honestly in the last month we have like over like eight to ten times the amount of currency

2959
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:40,000
dropping you know and you know there's the cool things about it as well which are the subtle things

2960
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:45,000
like a boss is way more likely to drop the higher tier currencies and stuff because again rarity

2961
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:50,000
affects that as well now so you're like way more incentivized to go and kill bosses to get them and

2962
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:54,000
there's heaps of awesome stuff around there but we're actually now finding people are exalting gear

2963
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:59,000
um during the campaign throwing it on weapons and building weapons from scratch that you find a

2964
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:07,000
very good transmute org regal exalt exalt you know that process is like transmute um org regal exalt

2965
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:12,000
is like a thing that you're doing often yeah and like enjoy and you know like you find good bases and

2966
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:15,000
you do stuff with that i can speak to that experience so i've played probably six-ish hours

2967
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:21,000
some most of the way through act two on my mercenary and i've found maybe six or seven exalts i took a ring

2968
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:25,000
from like a one blue stat ring that had a nice roll maybe a nice life roll or something and

2969
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:31,000
crafted it up to six property rare and i crafted a crossbow that i found with good sockets that had a

2970
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:36,000
good damage roll on it and i took that to six properties with multiple damage mods i'm like

2971
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:41,000
each time that power is going up and i was i was i was doing that it feels good i felt like the bottom

2972
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:45,000
was regals which was actually kind of interesting because i don't know if that's intentional just luck

2973
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:50,000
because i did really have to think about which blue items were good enough to take to a rare yep

2974
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:54,000
so that i could then put my exalts on them so you get more of those by disenchanting rares

2975
03:16:54,000 --> 03:17:00,000
yeah they are farmable so they are farmable which is um completely intentional we want to make sure

2976
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:03,000
that like if you don't have enough of those like so you get so generally speaking it's like you're

2977
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:07,000
going to want to keep uh like i feel like once you get like more than like five or six transmutes

2978
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:10,000
then you stop disenchanting blues and start selling them instead yeah and the same thing could be true

2979
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:14,000
also for um for regals where it's like okay once you've got more than a certain amount then you're like okay

2980
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:18,000
i can stop having to disenchant the stuff and kind of switch over but the nice thing is is like when you don't have

2981
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:22,000
enough there is a way to get them um which i think is really important and the same is true with the

2982
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:25,000
socket currency as well where it's like you know when you don't have enough you can start salvaging

2983
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:29,000
i know you were telling me you were buying stuff from the vendor with sockets in order to surprise them

2984
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:35,000
with my yeah yeah with my methods uh yeah yeah um so uh that stuff um you know it's just really nice

2985
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:41,000
to have that for people to have the ability to um uh you know to to get that stuff when they need it

2986
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:45,000
and so it's nice that like all that really basic stuff of just like getting items to better tiers

2987
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:50,000
and it is now way easier to get and that solved a problem that we had um through quite a lot of

2988
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:54,000
the betas where people were saying they didn't feel like they had enough control like they didn't

2989
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:58,000
feel like they had a way to advance their character um when they needed to um to be able to solve

2990
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:01,000
specific problems and i think the socket thing really has helped a lot with that now because

2991
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:06,000
now we have a way finally to be like okay if i need a bunch of fire resist there is a way to get

2992
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:11,000
that and i've got the tools to do it and i've got items i can use to do this stuff so um that um

2993
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:15,000
has helped a huge amount i think of um solving those like uh you know you know issues that come

2994
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:20,000
up with your character and this is to confirm how you've solved bench crafting exactly so we went

2995
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:26,000
through so many iterations of bench uh stuff it was like a huge thing we implemented tons of ui like

2996
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:30,000
there was tons of wasted time there uh implementing crafting things the problem that we had was that

2997
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:34,000
the systems that we were making it's like we could balance them in the ways the players were happy with

2998
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:38,000
and um then the designers were very unhappy or we could balance them the way the designers were happy with

2999
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:41,000
and the players were unhappy and it's like when you've got a system where like you're fighting

3000
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:45,000
the players for what how the balance should be yeah but you can tell that means you have a system

3001
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:51,000
that is bad um but i think we were very like like i myself honestly was too slow to recognize the fact

3002
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:56,000
that a complete overhaul was needed um and um then at some point we actually the socket stuff originally

3003
03:18:56,000 --> 03:19:01,000
came from um the var orb like it was designed there yeah and then at some point i don't know who came

3004
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:05,000
up with it i think it might have just been you um who said like why don't we just no appreciate

3005
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:08,000
rishi thought of that okay yeah so rishi thought of the idea of like hey what if we just put sockets

3006
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:13,000
um you know in an early game what if you got them in act one what if you had rooms uh that would

3007
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:19,000
like let you um get the uh the you know the baseball as the way of solving the remedial crafting problem

3008
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:23,000
so then suddenly as soon as we do that it's like oh like i'm happy uh you know players are happy

3009
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:29,000
everyone's happy um so that means we have a good system that uh is working and you know and gets those

3010
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:35,000
good feelings so um that that i think was a real win um and uh you know yeah i'm i love how that system

3011
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:40,000
is feeling at the moment yeah so the bench was achieving two things kind of in its way um which

3012
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:45,000
was uh maybe even three gear customization for one like you take an item and you can do something

3013
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:49,000
more to it firstly and then you've got the problem fixing of like oh i need a bit more fire resistance

3014
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:54,000
and then the third thing was like the meta crafts um yeah yeah so you've handled those each in

3015
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:58,000
different ways exactly you've got the runes which do the first two things the customization and the

3016
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:03,000
problem fixing so early on but i think for the customization it's even it's it's the uh um

3017
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:07,000
sorry what do you call them the soul cores like the runes are more about the kind of like i need to

3018
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:11,000
fix resistances whereas the soul cores are more about like i want to customize my items in different

3019
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:15,000
ways than what i would um otherwise normally be able to do um and then of course you've got the

3020
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:18,000
omens to solve the meta crafting problem so we effectively move all that stuff around and

3021
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:22,000
essences of course yes of course um yeah so um yeah essence is what they allow you to do is get two

3022
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:27,000
deterministic mods yeah um so because you can upgrade to uh blue and the but you can also upgrade from

3023
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:32,000
blue to um to to to rare um with an essence as well so that lets you kind of get some of that stuff

3024
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:37,000
and then plus some of the omen things you can yeah there's stuff you can do there um that uh is i

3025
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:41,000
think going to be pretty interesting so that's just at the start of release yeah because obviously

3026
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:47,000
there's going to be more of course as we add more things you know so uh yeah um so i was like i was

3027
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:51,000
worried that you know some of the changes you're making might move us away from some of the like deep

3028
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:56,000
impactful crafting that we have but it sounds like you are still allowing like powerful

3029
03:20:56,000 --> 03:21:02,000
meta crafting for sure and the ability to make like a really good item for sure but you're also

3030
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:08,000
making sure that like the physical item itself that you find matters more absolutely and i mean

3031
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:11,000
like the more subtle that's what it's all about right there's so much more going on i think just

3032
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:16,000
like just like clever things we've done with the um with the item system as well like one of the things

3033
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:21,000
i love that we did is we've made it so that um so we've got blue and uh yellow chests you can find now

3034
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:27,000
and we've changed the uh world generation so that if a dead end is generated um the chance that you

3035
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:32,000
get a rare chest there is is way higher so effectively if a rare chest will spawn in the

3036
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:36,000
area then it will choose dead ends first to go there you feel better about um yeah effectively so

3037
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:39,000
like that means that we effectively mean that like when like it makes the world feel like you know as

3038
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:44,000
far as item drops go that like oh like it feels intentional right like oh i went down this into this

3039
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:47,000
dead end room but look there was a rare chest there so i feel happy about it you know like that kind

3040
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:52,000
of thing is is is really cool um so uh there's things like that but there's also the way that um

3041
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:57,000
yeah so we've alluded to a few times but the the way that rarity now works um where the mods get better

3042
03:21:57,000 --> 03:22:03,000
as rarity increases and um also things like the um you get better currency rather than just yeah

3043
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:07,000
it means we don't have to have like the spam of items that's like crazy like you actually feel like

3044
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:15,000
um the uh that you kill a boss and it drops good shit um as opposed to just lots of shit um so uh

3045
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:19,000
you know that that's the uh that's that's that's i'm a big fan of how this feels i think it's a lot

3046
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:23,000
better um but it does mean though of course if you're a pew we one player and you see a boss kill

3047
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:28,000
like the number of like the the expectation of like because a pew one player sees like looks at the

3048
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:33,000
amount of spam on the screen uh in some to some level as the way of like knowing uh how good the

3049
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:37,000
drops were now of course you've got item filters and everything we have quantity brain right yeah yeah

3050
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:42,000
exactly yeah um exactly that is a good way of putting it um so uh yeah it really is more about like is

3051
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:47,000
the is are the items actually good like ideally you kill a boss and you pick every item it drops

3052
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:52,000
up um you know like that is a uh that to me is a win and i think we've uh we we're we're basically

3053
03:22:52,000 --> 03:23:01,000
getting at that point yeah um i i quite like how um the uh exploration systems in that as well with

3054
03:23:01,000 --> 03:23:05,000
the chests down dead ends and things like that acts as a player leveler in some ways where like

3055
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:09,000
the more you're struggling yep the more you explore the more stuff you'll find and that's true as

3056
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:13,000
well for the um optional encounters around the place as well um if you're um if you're struggling

3057
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:17,000
go fight some optional content there'll be stuff there that can um that can drop and you know um

3058
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:22,000
that then and you will definitely find more things and lots of guaranteed rare rare items here and

3059
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:29,000
there exactly like that so this little boss here will drop a caster a rare caster item and like heaps

3060
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:33,000
of stuff and the funny thing about that is that stuff um like the came about a little bit from the fact

3061
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:38,000
that um we actually had a problem where people were just uh face tanking bosses and dying over and over

3062
03:23:38,000 --> 03:23:43,000
again yeah they keep on respawning and they would never be like oh i'm gonna go away and uh actually

3063
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:48,000
find some other stuff and so um i was thinking for a long time about like well why is it that in other

3064
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:54,000
games um that people don't do that like if i'm playing elden ring and i die to a boss like you know

3065
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:58,000
10 times i'm not just gonna like just just continue doing that i'm gonna be like oh maybe i'll go do

3066
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:02,000
something else for a while so we realized that the map like the idea of just there's lots of stuff to

3067
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:06,000
find like there's actually a really important part of that so in pwee 2 now one of the recent uh things

3068
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:12,000
and it's taken a lot of work from uh from people to get this working but now all of that um uh there's

3069
03:24:12,000 --> 03:24:16,000
a you can see all the sort of weird side encounters that have specific drops on the map yeah and that

3070
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:19,000
means that you know if you're if you're having trouble with the boss you're like oh you know

3071
03:24:19,000 --> 03:24:23,000
what i'm just gonna go do some other stuff um and uh then you'll come back and you will be powerful

3072
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:26,000
enough to kill the boss much more easily because you do absolutely find the rewarding things yeah

3073
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:30,000
there's a little chest on there or a little campsite yeah yeah like you know there's lots of little

3074
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:34,000
hard-coded drops from specific bosses they only the hard-coded drops they only drop one time so you can't

3075
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:37,000
just farm them endlessly yeah but effectively if you go do all that side content and you check it

3076
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:42,000
all off you'll get um some very rewarding stuff yeah you got some pretty clever systems there and

3077
03:24:42,000 --> 03:24:47,000
i definitely noted that i was using the map thing a lot so i'd be like oh well to be completionist

3078
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:52,000
about it a bit but also yeah just being aware of like oh cool there was some there's some good

3079
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:56,000
stuff in this zone that i can come and find and uh i think we figured out that like that some of

3080
03:24:56,000 --> 03:25:00,000
that stuff reveals after you like find the waypoint in a zone i think that's how it works is that yeah it's

3081
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:05,000
either there's a few things so it's like uh either because an npc told you about an area in which case

3082
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:11,000
it just happens to be revealed uh or at the very least yes when you get there uh generally it's just

3083
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:15,000
when you get there you see everything um but there's a few different conditions that will reveal

3084
03:25:15,000 --> 03:25:19,000
everything um it kind of depends like a lot of people just click through the dialogue so they'll never

3085
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:23,000
know the npc told them but they maybe i was checking my map kind of like when i went into a zone and then

3086
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:28,000
maybe afterwards to see if there was anything but like you never get to an area and and don't see some

3087
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:33,000
unless they are like very obviously hidden intentional secrets that there's no one

3088
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:36,000
everywhere they might be there they might not have found half of your key for your secret quest

3089
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:38,000
oh yeah yeah don't worry about that

3090
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:47,000
so uh pivoting into economy and trading um the exchange from path of exile's one experiment

3091
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:52,000
recently we got a chance to actually try that live in the field and it seems from the players

3092
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:57,000
perspective it was a smash hit like definitely for us as well yeah okay solved a lot i'm like we're 100 on

3093
03:25:57,000 --> 03:26:02,000
board with that um it's very good it was the least least stressful league i ever played

3094
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:07,000
i mean what what normally caused almost all the anger and friction for me was was um

3095
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:13,000
was yes especially bulk trading it was horrible and i was just like oh this is like a dream come true

3096
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:16,000
myself and so many other players i feel like we're more engaged in endgame we were able to do the

3097
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:23,000
thing we wanted to do more and we're just less aggravated on that moment to moment basis that's good so do you

3098
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:29,000
take that then as like um as a big positive for it going into part of exile 2 100 and how do you

3099
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:32,000
feel like it adapts to the game being quite different in the end because they are pretty

3100
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:36,000
different games like the economy works a bit differently um i mean honestly i think it will

3101
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:40,000
i think it will just work um i mean look we don't we have no idea what the trade values will settle on

3102
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:43,000
and like how that'll end up but yeah like is it going to be chaos is going to be

3103
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:49,000
yeah but uh ultimately i think that the trades like effectively settlers was a test of what the

3104
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:53,000
trade of what the um economy will be like in poe 2 and to some extent because of the way that you

3105
03:26:53,000 --> 03:26:57,000
know we did the gold and everything yeah so um i'm pretty confident that that's going to be okay

3106
03:26:57,000 --> 03:27:01,000
but obviously you never know right like uh when lots of people hit the economy what can happen um

3107
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:06,000
hopefully we don't cause like horrible hyperinflation or have some horrible issue like that but uh i guess

3108
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:10,000
well you know i part of partly this is what a what an early access is to find out right like

3109
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:14,000
whether there's any issues like that was there any economy testing was there any surprises with

3110
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:19,000
that or with gold in terms of how things panned out um thankfully not honestly like uh we were

3111
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:24,000
worried but thankfully none of the like horrible situations came to pass with that and uh it ended

3112
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:31,000
up working just fine so um yeah like uh it went great who'd have thought 10 years later we'd be

3113
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:37,000
back here saying you know what gold was a good idea exactly exactly because we're i remember 10

3114
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:41,000
years ago we're like this game is brilliant it has no gold stupid gold but the funny thing is is

3115
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:47,000
i don't think we would have arrived at the way gold is now if we had had it in the first place yeah

3116
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:51,000
like the non-tradability of either using it as a sort of marker for how much play you've done i just

3117
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:55,000
don't i don't think that we would have ever had that way if we hadn't arrived from here so yeah

3118
03:27:55,000 --> 03:28:04,000
i think that path dependency kind of did matter um so yeah the paths we weave um so uh

3119
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:11,000
uh how likely then based on just how successful it is are you to want to expand the like exchanges

3120
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:18,000
capabilities to like other things like maps or waystones or even gear um well i mean look i'm

3121
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:21,000
interested in this but i don't think it's necessary right now so we're not going in early access at

3122
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:26,000
least um we're not going to launch with any expanded stuff in that way um but i guess i i do want to

3123
03:28:26,000 --> 03:28:29,000
sort of see how it works and um i'm interested in potentially trying something like that in the

3124
03:28:29,000 --> 03:28:35,000
future i just don't like the currency exchange was like 90 of the problem yeah um and and so

3125
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:39,000
fixing that like fixed a lot of the you know like it seemed like there would be we would need to do

3126
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:42,000
more initially and then maybe now it's seeming like maybe we don't but i still i i still want

3127
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:46,000
to experiment with it potentially so um you know i'm interested to see how it goes but um yeah the

3128
03:28:46,000 --> 03:28:50,000
currency exchange definitely helped um a vast amount those were the annoying yeah they were for sure

3129
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:59,000
they would yeah yeah definitely great um so we've had some uh well uh so this is a tricky question

3130
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:06,000
to answer especially if we could just scroll down yeah um so what are you aiming for in terms of path

3131
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:13,000
of exile 2 is kind of like personal player economy and progression uh so how much resources you're

3132
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:21,000
acquiring how you're uh using them but also how much are you getting from trade versus from yourself

3133
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:27,000
i mean this is a tricky question but i mean i think that really the feeling of like being able to trade

3134
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:31,000
is super important so being able to get that stuff i think um is good like now not everyone wants to do

3135
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:35,000
that you need to be able to progress through the game well without having to do much trade but um i do

3136
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:39,000
think that like you know look it's definitely going to be the case that if you're playing in a trade

3137
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:43,000
league you're going to have um the ability to to accelerate you very significantly and that's

3138
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:46,000
that's that's the case and it will continue to be the case and yeah like we are a game that embraces

3139
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:51,000
trade yeah like i think the dna of path of exile one is very much that like it is a game about

3140
03:29:51,000 --> 03:29:57,000
economy and trade and for some people getting rich is their main motivator 100 so effectively yeah so

3141
03:29:57,000 --> 03:30:01,000
i mean that that that will absolutely affect it and look like i think that the feeling of that will

3142
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:05,000
probably end up feeling quite similar to pwee one in that regard yeah um and um i think that's what

3143
03:30:05,000 --> 03:30:09,000
you know that's the type of game we're making yeah do you think it's uh that said though do you

3144
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:15,000
think it is in some ways better for a for a solar cell found sort of experience um i mean i simply

3145
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:19,000
do simply because again as we talked about we're dropping a lot more currency that we expect you

3146
03:30:19,000 --> 03:30:28,000
to use on right as opposed to save to end game for one and then by end game like we don't have um

3147
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:33,000
kerak mods costing you know that kind of stuff that all costs chaos and you don't have like the

3148
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:38,000
meta mods costing divines and all that right they're all different items you know i want meta mod crafting

3149
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:42,000
there's a ritual you know where to get them as well right so you're not just like having to

3150
03:30:42,000 --> 03:30:47,000
i'm blocked behind this thing because i need so many divines and i can't get that because i'm

3151
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:53,000
solar self-found and farming divines is not exactly you know beyond trivial so you know there's a number

3152
03:30:53,000 --> 03:30:59,000
of ways there where i'd say it is honestly a much better solar self-found experience um but you know

3153
03:30:59,000 --> 03:31:04,000
each to their own that to be seen and you know and there'll be a separate solar self-found mode

3154
03:31:04,000 --> 03:31:08,000
presumably even potentially beta launch or in the future uh it is our intention to have

3155
03:31:08,000 --> 03:31:13,000
hardcore and solar self-found cool yeah i wouldn't play hardcore for your first round honestly because

3156
03:31:13,000 --> 03:31:18,000
uh you're likely to die like once you learn the boss mechanics it should be fine but someone's gonna

3157
03:31:18,000 --> 03:31:23,000
first time you know it's gonna be tricky couch co-op hardcore and you get to see your friend die right

3158
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:29,000
next to you that's the true dream actually actually hang on wait in couch co-op hardcore do we still

3159
03:31:29,000 --> 03:31:32,000
lock the camera so you can't walk away from your friend uh no we we put you back to you back to

3160
03:31:32,000 --> 03:31:38,000
back to back to okay great that's good good to know it's like you have a morning period of about

3161
03:31:38,000 --> 03:31:43,000
30 seconds right right right but you're just like all right you can go home now i'm like yeah yeah

3162
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:52,000
see you what do you do yeah that is uh that's a devastating moment um so uh

3163
03:31:54,000 --> 03:32:00,000
uh i did lose my place there um yeah i think we mentioned the co-op support and everything and

3164
03:32:00,000 --> 03:32:07,000
we'll scroll down and take some of the additional questions here excellent thanks um so uh will there

3165
03:32:07,000 --> 03:32:12,000
be a penalty for individual party member dying when grouping up for bosses on that note then

3166
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:16,000
uh it seems weird that the boss straight up resets when playing solo but when playing in a group

3167
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:20,000
nothing happens if a party member dies so tell us about the rules yeah because i know you've changed

3168
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:26,000
them recently uh yeah so well bosses are obviously harder for having more people yeah um less crowd

3169
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:32,000
controls um things like um obviously more life and i'm not just saying double life more than double

3170
03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:38,000
life right it does get more than twice as hard or more than in players as hard um

3171
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:45,000
so yes you could argue okay we have reviving as an advantage well yes it does it does take time to

3172
03:32:45,000 --> 03:32:49,000
revive and if your friend dies early and you're unable to revive them because you're constantly being

3173
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:54,000
interrupted well if i'm not sorry it's pretty hard you're not having a fun time get a big stun or

3174
03:32:54,000 --> 03:32:59,000
something um another change that we made recently is of course for each revived between each set of

3175
03:32:59,000 --> 03:33:03,000
checkpoints every time you have to revive them the revive takes longer subsequent times so that's

3176
03:33:03,000 --> 03:33:08,000
important because it just means that um if you're like you can't revive spam anymore because it's

3177
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:12,000
going to take longer and longer each time um but then when you go to a checkpoint that resets so um

3178
03:33:12,000 --> 03:33:17,000
like you're back to normal now in end game maps you cannot revive each other death is a consequence

3179
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:23,000
yeah um i was gonna ask actually about like end game maps and um what is the rule for dying

3180
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:26,000
anything about is it one portal deal now not six portals well you still have six portals so you

3181
03:33:26,000 --> 03:33:30,000
have your party members but there's all right and you can leave and come back as long as you don't

3182
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:36,000
die so you can take items out but a death will end that map for you ah yeah and to remind people the uh

3183
03:33:37,000 --> 03:33:41,000
if you like log out or server crashes or something like that's gonna happen then uh

3184
03:33:43,000 --> 03:33:46,000
the game pauses so when you log when you boot the game back up and log back in you'll be still in

3185
03:33:46,000 --> 03:33:51,000
your map right and also um even that we've also now have it so that when you if you just like if you just

3186
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:55,000
order for the game at a random time um you'll actually even if you come back like you know

3187
03:33:55,000 --> 03:34:02,000
like the next day um you know because for example you might have rage quit you you you will appear

3188
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:05,000
back at the checkpoint you were at so if you um are like fighting a boss you die a bunch of times

3189
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:09,000
you're like ah crap uh older four um you come back you're going to be right there at the boss checkpoint

3190
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:14,000
again that part is campaign specific because there are no checkpoints in maps yeah non maps but in um

3191
03:34:14,000 --> 03:34:20,000
for the for the campaign though um and that honestly um this has helped a lot like uh there were so many i

3192
03:34:20,000 --> 03:34:24,000
i think it's actually i think it i think it really did cause new players to have problems in pb1

3193
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:28,000
where um they felt like they just lost track of where the hell they even were when they came back

3194
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:31,000
after a session if like they might have not got waypoints for certain times or things like that

3195
03:34:31,000 --> 03:34:34,000
like you now can't have the situation where you log back in and you're like oh i'm like i forgot

3196
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:37,000
like three waypoints in a row and now i'm like freaking miles away from where i was

3197
03:34:37,000 --> 03:34:41,000
um which i think happened to new players fairly frequently i'm glad in a world where everyone's

3198
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:44,000
becoming a souls like that you guys didn't do the running back to the boss

3199
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:48,000
right right right right right right right right right and you just kind of jump back in

3200
03:34:48,000 --> 03:34:53,000
yeah yeah i have another crack um so uh yeah so effectively like that that's nice to just have

3201
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:58,000
the save checkpoints um to your to your character um which i think is a nice one um were there any

3202
03:34:58,000 --> 03:35:03,000
other mechanics around there reviving well obviously in hardcore you're dead you're dead

3203
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:09,000
that's the drill so your maps almost embraces a kind of semi-hardcore mentality there where there is

3204
03:35:09,000 --> 03:35:16,000
actual cost like we went through so many iterations here where it's like okay like the moment that you

3205
03:35:16,000 --> 03:35:22,000
have to spend something of economic value to do the attempt yeah hence a map a map item and

3206
03:35:22,000 --> 03:35:27,000
especially if it's got breaches and all this content that's coming from precursor tablets all of the

3207
03:35:27,000 --> 03:35:32,000
stuff is worth stuff so you all of a sudden have heaps of stuff on the line and then you don't want to

3208
03:35:32,000 --> 03:35:37,000
be in a position where you're like uh no i i need to bring in some people to do this because i'm not

3209
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:43,000
going to risk that value um so that's why we just were like in maps no reviving it's just like yeah sure

3210
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:47,000
you still can always bring in any context someone way more powerful than you to carry things right

3211
03:35:47,000 --> 03:35:53,000
that's the benefit of multiplayer um but feeling like you have to do this thing because then they

3212
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:57,000
can just keep reviving you so you can get all the rewards like we're trying to get away from all of

3213
03:35:57,000 --> 03:36:02,000
that otherwise you get this weird thing where like you you're often always too scared to do the thing

3214
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:09,000
now now you're scared but everyone's scared and it's fine and you don't feel like you you're like okay i

3215
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:14,000
you have to go in with a sense of confidence to like i can definitely do this thing um and so it's

3216
03:36:14,000 --> 03:36:17,000
just a little bit less fear when it comes to all of a sudden doing that that's much better in the

3217
03:36:17,000 --> 03:36:23,000
context of the fact that you can pause the game if your cat's on fire or if uh the server crashes

3218
03:36:23,000 --> 03:36:28,000
or something that you just paused and you can jump back in as well you're failing because of your own

3219
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:33,000
faults yep now it's worth noting in multiplayer we do have a thing of course we've respawn at checkpoints

3220
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:37,000
as an option so if a player dies and you don't want to like you don't want to die you

3221
03:36:37,000 --> 03:36:42,000
you don't want to finish the fight out you can both choose to respawn at checkpoint and then it

3222
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:47,000
will just create a new instance you don't you don't have to die to do it um and you don't have to log

3223
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:52,000
out and do any shenanigans like that you can just press escape hit respawn at checkpoint it'll ask

3224
03:36:52,000 --> 03:36:57,000
other players to confirm and then it moves you all to the new area cool excellent um i didn't want to

3225
03:36:57,000 --> 03:37:00,000
go super on it because we've definitely talked about it before but click to move versus wsd it's

3226
03:37:00,000 --> 03:37:04,000
definitely been asked about a bit um so there's been plenty of reports about wsd being amazing

3227
03:37:04,000 --> 03:37:08,000
personally i've been using it a ton and really enjoying it i know a lot of you've said a lot of

3228
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:14,000
people around the office have like given it a try and adapted to that but it has raised the point for

3229
03:37:14,000 --> 03:37:18,000
people that feel like they're still uh very much against that for whatever reason or maybe that they

3230
03:37:18,000 --> 03:37:23,000
literally only have one hand and and want to use click to move still um how does it stack up how does

3231
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:29,000
click to move still stack up now i think i think honestly it's fine like it's not been a problem i i

3232
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:34,000
there was a time where every time i'd go to sit down at a developer's computer that'd be in wsd and just

3233
03:37:34,000 --> 03:37:40,000
because it's a little bit easier to move around again or whatever um but lately i'd say now it's

3234
03:37:40,000 --> 03:37:44,000
back to almost every designer's computer i sit back down at to go play they're back and click to move

3235
03:37:44,000 --> 03:37:49,000
interesting yeah it's gone full tilt the other way um and i'm always like ah change it back

3236
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:56,000
um but um even watching octavian play on click to move he's a click to move player yeah yeah he's 100

3237
03:37:56,000 --> 03:38:01,000
click to move he is very proficient with that yeah with it that'll be reassuring for i think some of

3238
03:38:01,000 --> 03:38:06,000
the people that are worried about being forced into wsd even though it is obviously playing so

3239
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:12,000
well by many by all accounts um that's very good then yeah and octavian's often doing the

3240
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:17,000
demonstrations for your live things too so you'll be able to see that even i have to force them to

3241
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:21,000
play wsd sometimes because i'm like oh i think the mercenary looks so much better with wsd just

3242
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:26,000
visually yeah um so uh you know it does feel very good on the mercenary yeah they're kind of like

3243
03:38:26,000 --> 03:38:30,000
stalking through especially with that kind of like preparational yeah yeah play style yeah yeah

3244
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:36,000
that's good loving loving it so far um we did already talk about the skin transfers could we

3245
03:38:36,000 --> 03:38:40,000
scroll down to any additional questions that we have i feel like i don't even know how long we've

3246
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:46,000
been going for but i i mean it's a while we're getting creeping at this yeah exactly we've been going

3247
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:51,000
we've been rolling yeah yeah um people asking if there's going to be anything like challenges or

3248
03:38:51,000 --> 03:38:58,000
challenge rewards in the early not at first no we will do it later though did i ask about races

3249
03:38:58,000 --> 03:39:03,000
events and private leagues uh i think not initially um but we will do it later for sure

3250
03:39:03,000 --> 03:39:07,000
um i think the i'm not sure what happened because i think i think the issue was that the private

3251
03:39:07,000 --> 03:39:11,000
league interface was like on the poe one site and we had to do some work and something like that

3252
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:14,000
it wouldn't be far away though like it won't take us that long before we get to it like you know

3253
03:39:14,000 --> 03:39:18,000
i can't exactly remember either but yeah it wouldn't be private leagues in particular wouldn't be far

3254
03:39:18,000 --> 03:39:23,000
away yeah yeah um yeah so i mean we'll have them just not like right initially potentially

3255
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:29,000
and uh i think i did miss this actually so cluster jewels are a thing or not a thing are they they've

3256
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:32,000
been kind of replaced by those yeah we replace them with that almost like rollable timeless jewel kind

3257
03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:38,000
of thing yeah um at least for now there's like so much passive tree there and the jewels accomplish

3258
03:39:38,000 --> 03:39:44,000
the kind of off build thing anyway you hardly need to add the extra passive trees on your passive trees

3259
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:48,000
yes yes we don't yeah we that's after launch we made the passive tree implicitly bigger so

3260
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:53,000
the cost of jewels are in the tree already that's again i talk about like year three features that's

3261
03:39:53,000 --> 03:39:58,000
that's around like year three to year five feature as well so yeah we got another decade of what we

3262
03:39:58,000 --> 03:40:02,000
had with path of exile one to look forward to for path of exile two hopefully before we

3263
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:09,000
start uh worrying about path of exile three maybe geez you go just just to start thinking just

3264
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:17,000
start thinking about it we uh so i guess to just finish this off for today then do you guys have

3265
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:23,000
a recommendation or of what is the best class to play in the beta uh i mean that's a very hard one um

3266
03:40:23,000 --> 03:40:29,000
honestly like so so many choices there are so let me well okay if we're going by the numbers oh yeah

3267
03:40:30,000 --> 03:40:35,000
if we go by player satisfaction reports on uh per class uh we break it down yeah i mean this is good

3268
03:40:35,000 --> 03:40:40,000
uh then uh then that means the monk is very interesting because the monk is the class that

3269
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:45,000
dies the most often but it's also the class that when people play it they have the highest satisfaction

3270
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:49,000
level by a very very tiny margin that compares the others that's fascinating yeah i mean it is like

3271
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:53,000
glass cannon you know like it's very fast but you have to you have to retreat and move in and out

3272
03:40:53,000 --> 03:40:57,000
i fell in love with the monk playing it looks like it's got a little better yeah yeah that's interesting

3273
03:40:57,000 --> 03:41:01,000
but um i think if you're a new player um then the mercenary if you're like used to shooters and stuff i

3274
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:05,000
think playing the mercenary could be a good win like i i i really love that class

3275
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:11,000
um i don't know like i've been loving the mercenary um but uh to me it feels like a you need to really

3276
03:41:11,000 --> 03:41:14,000
be considering each engagement a lot more it's a bit more a bit more tactical

3277
03:41:14,000 --> 03:41:21,000
i don't know like i like it i i really like correct if you but um honestly like i mean i i go through

3278
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:25,000
favorite classes all the time whenever i change to play a different class that becomes my favorite

3279
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:31,000
so you know yes it's whatever whatever i'm playing tends to be the thing so uh yeah right now i'm doing a

3280
03:41:31,000 --> 03:41:36,000
mercenary playthrough so that's probably why i'm uh into that but uh yeah that's uh i'm not sure if

3281
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:40,000
you've got a similar you're talking about the numbers as well it was interesting that monk and

3282
03:41:40,000 --> 03:41:45,000
then warrior had the highest satisfaction by the way technically if you're looking for that's pretty

3283
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:50,000
good that's uh two melee classes exactly that's a win yeah that's something going on i mean they were

3284
03:41:50,000 --> 03:41:55,000
dying a lot more at the time but yeah it's such a change from like especially early part of exile

3285
03:41:55,000 --> 03:42:00,000
one like it's got a little better in one days but still i mean i i just have a like real desire

3286
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:06,000
to freeze time so i just want to just go i don't know what it's good to get some sorceress love i

3287
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:09,000
feel like she's not getting enough attention i don't know what i don't know what skills i'll play

3288
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:13,000
but i definitely just want to be able to freeze time so yeah it just feels cool all right so you

3289
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:17,000
could be playing you could be playing crossbow building yeah i might be a crossbow time freezer i don't

3290
03:42:17,000 --> 03:42:22,000
know we'll see what's going on yeah all right i i noted i liked that i noted that our mercenaries were

3291
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:27,000
very different as well i was playing full grenade or you were i was doing the freeze uh free shotgun

3292
03:42:27,000 --> 03:42:33,000
yeah very cool yeah yeah some sort of monk trigger build obviously it's always just going to be fun

3293
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:38,000
to yeah they have so many of those like stacking effects the wind and the ice coming off it and

3294
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:44,000
the ascendancy showed some more as well just see how far that can be pushed and how many spells can i

3295
03:42:44,000 --> 03:42:50,000
get to trigger per second yeah like they'll seem good for that all righty well thank you very much for

3296
03:42:50,000 --> 03:42:54,000
your time both of you for i don't even know how long that was a mammoth session i think we're

3297
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:57,000
coming up to one o'clock here so there's still lots to talk about but i think we just need some

3298
03:42:57,000 --> 03:43:02,000
time to digest for sure for sure um so uh well thankfully we didn't have everyone saying patch

3299
03:43:02,000 --> 03:43:07,000
notes when uh this time so good so that means we actually have a conversation there's no pressure

3300
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:13,000
on this to like wrap it up yeah yeah exactly um so uh you know that's good fantastic all right thank

3301
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:17,000
you very much for watching everybody i hope you enjoyed the q a that's a good eat oh they want patch

3302
03:43:17,000 --> 03:43:25,000
notes now oh thank you exactly exactly where's the launch notes yeah yeah all right all right

3303
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:30,000
all right yeah and thank you very much thanks heaps appreciate it it's been an epic journey it's

3304
03:43:30,000 --> 03:43:37,000
