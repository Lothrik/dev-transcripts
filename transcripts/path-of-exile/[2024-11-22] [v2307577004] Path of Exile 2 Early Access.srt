You

102
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You

103
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
You

104
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You

105
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
You

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
You

107
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You

108
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You

109
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
You

110
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You

111
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You

112
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
You

113
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You

114
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
You

115
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Sir just what are we facing here?

116
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
a relic of the old world

117
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Ready your men captain

118
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
We will only get one chance

119
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And remember

120
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
When you hear the whispers

121
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Call for help

122
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Do not attack

123
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You hear the whispers

124
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
What do you think he was on about?

125
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
It's Dorman right?

126
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Yeah

127
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Then Dorman

128
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Shut your damn mouth

129
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Why do I always get stuck with these rookies?

130
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Hey the kids got a mean cleave

131
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Give him a chance

132
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Shaman

133
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
A

134
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Mean cleave a captain rookie can't even lift his own

135
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Captain Oren captain

136
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's here rain send the signal

137
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
On my back laid off come on

138
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It's a man

139
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Oh

140
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Ron

141
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Oh

142
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Are you here

143
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Oh

144
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:15,000
On your feet lad sir the captain I do be fine here

145
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
What is it

146
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Get the body

147
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Stop

148
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Mortal

149
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
It can still be contained

150
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
You don't know what you have

151
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Your kind no longer control this world

152
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
We cannot destroy your body it's true

153
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But you will watch as we destroy everything you have built

154
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Bind him

155
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Feed grow my child

156
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'll make sure you can eat your fill

157
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I

158
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I

159
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Hi I'm Jonathan Rogers game director on path of exile 2

160
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Now path of exile 2 is going into early access in around two weeks on December the 6th

161
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But even though it's early access this isn't just some small taste the game is huge

162
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
In this live stream we're going to be introducing everything you can expect

163
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So without further ado let's roll the gameplay trailer

164
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Existence is a thing of beauty precious but impermanent

165
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Life and death are mortal enemies and yet bound to one another

166
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:35,000
The continuation of life must be protected at all costs

167
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Some have said my methods are brutal

168
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:52,000
To this I say there can be no salvation without sacrifice

169
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I

170
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,000
We are faced with the end and I will do what I must

171
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Those who obsess with death

172
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Let them soon be acquainted with it

173
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Now as you just saw even in early access path of exile 2 is a big game

174
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It's actually been five years since we announced PoE 2 and over that time we've revealed a lot

175
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
But it's been in bits and pieces

176
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's pretty hard to keep track of it all so today we're going to do a full rundown of all the content that will be available at the start of early access

177
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Classes, character progression systems and for the first time a full overview of the end game

178
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
This is going to be a big one so get comfortable

179
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
For 20 years Rayclast has been free from any sources of corruption

180
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
But the Count of Ogham, tempted by promises of power, intends to harness it once more

181
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
The day of the end of the game is the day of the end of the game

182
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:14,000
The dead are rising, monsters are mutating and madness is spreading

183
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Under the dark influence of corruption the Count doles out sentences of death to any who would question him

184
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And this is where you find yourself at the start of PoE 2

185
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Explore the dark forests of Ogham, traverse the barren plains of the Vesteri Desert

186
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And delve into the jungle ruins of Utsal, an ancient Vaal city

187
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:58,000
There are challenging monsters, hidden ruins, lost camps and treasures, roaming merchants and of course unique bosses

188
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
No two areas are the same

189
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
It falls to you to track down the seed of corruption, the source of all this devastation

190
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:14,000
On the way you'll face fearsome monsters, meet strange characters, forge unlikely bonds and uncover lost civilizations

191
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But first you'll need to pick a class

192
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Now Early Access will initially have six classes available, let's have a look at them

193
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter

194
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
He dashes in and out of combat and has mechanics that involve building up and keeping momentum

195
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Like all classes in PoE 2, you'll want to use a wide variety of skills to mix and match different combos

196
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
To get new skills you will first need to find skill gems

197
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

198
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You can choose an existing skill

199
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter

200
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
He dashes in and out of combat and has mechanics that involve building up and keeping momentum

201
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Like all classes in PoE 2, you'll want to use a wide variety of skills to mix and match different combos

202
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

203
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
You can choose an existing skill gem

204
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

205
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter

206
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
He dashes in and out of combat and has mechanics that involve building up and keeping momentum

207
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Like all classes in PoE 2, you'll want to use a wide variety of skills available in PoE 2

208
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

209

01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

211
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter

212
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
He dashes in and out of combat and has mechanics that involve building up and keeping momentum

213
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Like all classes in PoE 2, you'll want to use a wide variety of skills available in PoE 2

214
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

215
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
You can choose an existing skill gem

216
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

217
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter

218
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
He dashes in and out of combat and has mechanics that involve building up and keeping momentum

219
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Like all classes in PoE 2, you'll want to use a wide variety of skills available in PoE 2

220
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

221
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You can choose an existing skill gem

222
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

223
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter

224
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
He dashes in and out of combat and has mechanics that involve building up and keeping momentum

225
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Like all classes in PoE 2, you'll want to use a wide variety of skills available in PoE 2

226
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

227
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

228
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There are 21 active skills for quarter staves, so this just scratches the surface of the options that you have

229
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:27,000
By endgame you'll be dashing from pack to pack, spewing where you find yourself at the start of PoE 2

230
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Explore the dark forests of Ogham

231
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Traverse the barren plains of the Vesteri Desert

232
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
And delve into the jungle ruins of Utsal, an ancient Vaal city

233
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:49,000
There are challenging monsters, hidden rooms, lost camps and treasures, roaming merchants, and of course unique bosses

234
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
No two areas are the same

235
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It falls to you to track down the seed of corruption, the source of all this devastation

236
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:05,000
On the way you'll face fearsome monsters, meet strange characters, forge unlikely bonds, and uncover lost civilizations

237
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
But first you'll need to pick a class

238
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Now Early Access will initially have six classes available, let's have a look at them

239
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
The Monk is a fast and furious melee fighter

240
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
He dashes in and out of combat and has mechanics that involve building up and keeping momentum

241
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Like all classes in PoE 2, you'll want to use a wide variety of skills to mix and match different combos

242
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
To get new skills you will first need to find skill gems

243
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Using a skill gem will open the gem cutting menu, which shows all the active skills available in PoE 2

244
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
You can choose an existing skill to level up, or choose to engrave a new one

245
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Since this is a level 7 skill gem, even if you pick a new skill it will immediately be level 7, so there's no harm in trying out something new

246
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
The Monk primarily uses the quarterstaff

247
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,000
There are three skills of martial arts, lightning, ice, and wind

248
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:10,000
But don't think you have to stick to just one, the best combos are going to involve mixing elements of all three

249
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Let's try killing palm

250
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Like many Monk skills this can be used to quickly take advantage of a specific situation

251
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
If there's an enemy on low life, you can use killing palm to dash to them and kill them instantly

252
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
This will provide a power charge

253
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Then we can use a different skill to consume that power charge for a much more devastating attack

254
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
The Monk also has powerful combo skills

255
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Tempest bell for example is a skill that places a giant resonating bell

256
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Hitting the bell causes it to ring, dealing damage to all enemies around it

257
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You can also do things like freeze or shock the bell, which will add elemental damage to the strikes

258
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
The Monk also has a variety of abilities to empower his staff

259
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
If an enemy is close to being stunned, you can use staggering palm to punch them down

260
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
After that, any attack you do will shoot out wind projectiles

261
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
There are 21 active skills for quarterstaffs, so this just scratches the surface of the options that you have

262
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:11,000
By endgame you'll be dashing from pack to pack, spewing projectiles and obliterating screens of enemies with huge combo attacks

263
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Now if you like a style of melee that's a little slower but hits much harder, then the Warrior is for you

264
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,000
He pounds the ground with big chunky attacks and can shrug off the hits of small enemies with large amounts of armor

265
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Even though the mace slams are slow, you never lose control

266
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Longer attacks can be retargeted as you go, and if you find yourself committed to a long attack, you can dodge roll out of it at any time

267
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Among the skill options for maces you'll find a variety of slams, fire attacks, war cries and shield skills

268
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Here I'm going to slam the ground, rending it apart with lines of fire

269
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Any slam skill will then cause these fissures to erupt with lava

270
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I can even run through them with a skill like Stampede to do huge amounts of damage

271
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
The Warrior can also use war cries, which can empower your next skill

272
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Seismic Cry for example will double any slams from your next attack

273
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
The Stampede counts as a slam so I can double that for even more craziness

274
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
If you want to go a little faster and be a little more defensive, equip a shield

275
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:19,000
In P.O.E. 2 you can raise your shield at any time to block all damage from the front, even spells

276
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
While holding up your shield your stun meter will build as you take damage, so be careful

277
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
If it reaches 100% your stance will break and you will be vulnerable

278
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Some enemies also have unblockable attacks which are indicated by this red flash

279
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
If you see one of these coming, make sure to dodge out of the way

280
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Using a shield also gives you access to shield skills like Shield Charge

281
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
which allows you to charge towards enemies and stun them

282
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
While charging you're also blocking the whole time so you have full damage immunity from the front

283
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
The Warrior also has access to totems

284
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Some totems have built-in abilities like Shockwave Totem

285
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
which can be placed to stun nearby enemies and trigger aftershocks like those from the earthquake

286
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
But you can also get Ancestral Warrior Totems which allow you to use any slam skill in your repertoire

287
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
This is a meta skill, which means that it's a skill you can put other skills into

288
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I can take a slam like Sunder and socket it into my Ancestral Warrior Totem

289
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Now when I summon him, he'll sit there and slam the monsters from a distance

290
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
There are 20 active skills for Maces, so there's a lot more to try out

291
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But by endgame you're going to be dropping hammers from the sky, leaping fearlessly into combat

292
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
and separating the very earth you stand on

293
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Time for some ranged attacks

294
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
The Ranger is primarily about the bow, but we wanted to make sure that she feels agile as well

295
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
In Pier 2 you can shoot while moving

296
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Combined with all the skills the Ranger has that allow you to jump around

297
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
you'll have a lot of mobility in combat

298
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Bow skills have a variety of lightning, poison, ice and physical attacks

299
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Lightning attacks bounce around between targets

300
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
You can also stick lightning arrows in the ground which explode when hit by the bounces

301
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
or electrocute enemies to take them out of combat

302
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Ice attacks later slow and freeze enemies to keep them away from you

303
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Using poison not only can you slowly damage your enemies from afar

304
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
but also grow some interesting plants

305
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
With 21 bow skills and all the mobility and combo tools the Ranger has

306
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
you can take advantage of every situation

307
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
By endgame you'll be creating hundreds of arrows

308
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,000
be they falling from the sky, bouncing around between enemies or spraying out of tornadoes

309
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You might have noticed in the bottom left of the screen that the flask slots look a little different

310
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
In Pier 2 you have one dedicated life flask slot and one mana flask slot

311
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Flasks gain charges as you kill enemies

312
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
and typically allow you to heal 6 or 7 times if they're full

313
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
But that's not the only thing you can use charges for

314
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Charms are a new item type that will automatically defend you from various debuffs or damage types

315
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Having trouble with getting frozen?

316
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Equip a thawing charm

317
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
When it's fully charged it will make you immune to freeze for 3 seconds if you get frozen

318
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
To recharge them just kill more monsters

319
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
You can gain more slots for charms by upgrading your belt

320
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
The Mercenary wields a crossbow that can be loaded with different ammo types

321
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
offering versatility, power and mobility

322
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
All classes in Path of Exile 2 can be controlled with WASD

323
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
which makes this class play exactly like a shooter

324
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
For the crossbow you will find skills that work like shotguns

325
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
sniper rifles

326
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
assault rifles

327
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
and even grenade launchers

328
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
But not only that there are a wide variety of more interesting elemental ammos too

329
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
It's very fast to switch between ammo types as long as you already have them loaded

330
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
which makes the Mercenary able to combo abilities together for devastating effect

331
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Use Glacial Bolt to create walls of ice to separate enemies

332
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
then switch to Fragmentation Rounds to explode the ice dealing massive AOE damage

333
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
If I come across an armoured enemy I could use Armour-Piercing Rounds to break their armour

334
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
and then High Velocity Rounds to take them down

335
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Or perhaps I could fire a Gas Grenade to poison enemies

336
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
before detonating the cloud with an Explosive Shot for massive damage

337
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
If you want to call in some suppressing fire you can summon Artillery Ballistas

338
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
These have a minimum range so you'll want to prepare your position carefully before moving in

339
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
There are 22 active skills for crossbows

340
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
By endgame you'll be calling Destruction down from the sky

341
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
as you litter the battlefield with grenades and pepper your enemies with your automatic shotgun

342
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
If you're looking to take a backseat and let your minions do the work

343
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
then the witch should be your choice

344
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
She can call forth hordes of undead monsters to fight for her

345
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
while casting powerful Chaos spells that debilitate her enemies

346
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Occult skills are some of the most varied in the game

347
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
with skeletons, noxious spells, specialty minions, curses and sacrificial magic

348
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Before we talk about minions we'll have to talk about a new resource in Path of Exile 2 called Spirit

349
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
This is a Spirit Gem which allows you to pick from a range of persistent skills

350
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
All classes have a variety of these skills which can add some very interesting effects

351
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
like Arctic Armor which does cold damage to enemies that hit you

352
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
or Raging Spirits which summon fiery skulls each time you cast a fire spell

353
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
For the witch though we'll want to be using our spirit to create permanent minions

354
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
These minions will be revived automatically when they die

355
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
so you don't have to worry about resummoning them all the time

356
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Here I'm using the skill screen to allocate which minions I would like in my horde

357
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
You can see the spirit cost of each one

358
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Skeletal warriors are cheap but weak, useful for tanking damage and distracting enemies

359
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
But I want more heavy hitters in my army

360
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
so I'm going to unsummon some warriors and instead add skeletal arsonists

361
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Permanent minions come with special active abilities called command skills

362
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You can order these guys to detonate your own minions for even more damage and area of effect

363
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
If you want a bigger army you'll need a scepter

364
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:01,000
This new weapon type is imbued with even more spirit allowing you to summon even more friends

365
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:07,000
And if you want an even bigger army than that you can take advantage of corpses to summon true hordes of minions

366
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
But what can a witch do while her army is at work?

367
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Well she has a range of chaos spells to spread disease amongst your enemies or bone skills to impale them

368
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Or you know, you could curse them to make them weaker so your horde can take them down

369
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
There are 25 active occult skills

370
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
By the endgame you'll be the leader of a fearsome army of the dead consuming everything in its path

371
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
The sorceress bends the elements to her will using them to unleash devastation on her foes

372
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
This classic spellcaster weaves a flurry of elemental magic from afar

373
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
The elemental skills have everything you might expect and more

374
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Fireballs, icy explosions, lightning, and fireballs

375
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
The elemental skills have everything you might expect and more

376
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Fireballs, icy explosions, lightning storms, you get the idea

377
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Each spell is unique and has many different ways to build and combo with others, even between different elements

378
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:04,000
For example, flame wall conjures a burning line that not only damages enemies but also empowers all projectiles that pass through it

379
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
If you place a wall and fire lightning sparks through it, they'll gain extra fire damage

380
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
It's a good idea to take advantage of the ability to automatically swap weapons when you use certain skills

381
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Having a special staff with bonuses to fire skills and another with bonuses to lightning skills can really power up a combo like this

382
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
The sorceress can also take advantage of powerful trigger gems

383
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
For example, you could grab the cast and ignite gem and use it with firestorm

384
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
As you ignite enemies, a counter will go up in the top left corner

385
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
When it's full, a firestorm will automatically be cast to the enemy that was ignited

386
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
There are 25 active elemental skills

387
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
By endgame, you'll be firing off projectiles left and right as you rain down elemental storms on your foes

388
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Now, those are the characters that will be available at the start of early access

389
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
But we will be adding 6 more character classes with just as many skills and options as these

390
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
There's a lot more to come

391
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
There's one more important thing to mention about skills

392
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Even though we talk about them as belonging to each class, in reality there are no restrictions

393
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
You can use all these skills on any class so long as you have the attributes

394
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,000
For example, a poison ranger might want to try out using occult curses to increase her poison damage

395
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Or a monk might want to trigger elemental ice walls to use with his glacial cascade combo

396
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
The possibilities for cross-class combos are practically unlimited

397
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
We're looking forward to what kind of things you guys might find

398
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Now, Path of Exile is a game known for build customization

399
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And we haven't even scratched the surface of what is possible yet

400
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So let's talk about support gems

401
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Path of Exile 2 has a system of support gems that can be combined with your active skills to dramatically change the way they work

402
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
If you find a support gem, then right-clicking it will open up this screen

403
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Here you will find a variety of recommended support gems for each of your skills that you can pick between

404
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,000
For example, this is a multiple projectile support gem and can be used to add multiple projectiles to any skill

405
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Normally when you fire a grenade, it will look like this

406
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
But if we add multiple projectiles, then you get three of them

407
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Once you have the gem, you can also freely move it between any of the skills on your character

408
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:15,000
If you want to have a multi-shot sniper rifle instead, then simply move the gem over to your high-velocity round skill

409
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Generally speaking, if it sounds like a support gem should work with a skill, then it will work, so it's a good idea to experiment

410
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Note that you can only have one of each support gem on your character

411
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Note that you can only have one of each support gem on your character, so you'll want to think carefully about which supports can be used best with each skill for maximum damage

412
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Now, if you want to stick to the recommendations, you should have a perfectly good time

413
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,000
But if you want to experiment a bit more, then uncheck that recommended button and you can see the full list of supports that will work with your skill

414
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
There are hundreds of support gems to choose from, and even we don't know the results of all the possible ways these can interact

415
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Each skill can have up to five supports socketed into it, and if you're clever, you can come up with some pretty interesting ideas

416
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Now, all of this is just scratching the surface

417
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
You can make frost vortexes, break people's armor, make minions explode, make skills repeat

418
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Make enemies set each other on fire, cull enemies, or pin them to the ground

419
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Supports let you drastically change the behavior of your skills and create your own unique build, or at least follow someone's OP build guide

420
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:23,000
So, speaking of builds, let's talk about one of the most iconic Path of Exile systems, the passive skill tree

421
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Yes, it's huge. There are over 1,500 nodes on there

422
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Now, a lot of people open the tree and can get a little intimidated at first, but try not to be scared

423
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
There are lots of options, but at its core, it's pretty simple

424
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Each level, you get one point to put into the tree

425
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Each class starts at a different location, but they all share the same tree

426
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Around your section of the tree, you'll find relevant bonuses for your character

427
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
You should be safe in the knowledge that there aren't many wrong choices here

428
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Almost all the starting nodes will be useful for your character in some way

429
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:01,000
But if you do happen to make a choice you regret, you'll be able to re-spec any nodes you've taken by spending a little bit of gold

430
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Now, the tree is generally divided up into clusters which have similar themes

431
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:17,000
In each cluster, you'll find small nodes that give simple bonuses like increased damage, but the real power comes from notables

432
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Notables normally have much more interesting bonuses, and they tend to care a lot more about how your build works and what skills you're using

433
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:31,000
For example, in the mercenary area of the tree, this one gives a 25% chance for crossbow skills to not consume a bolt

434
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
And here's one that gives grenades a chance to blow up a second time

435
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:44,000
This one gives a chance for projectiles to rebound off terrain, as well as giving you some pierce chance to make that more likely

436
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Note that even though this is in the mercenary section, this would work with projectiles from all classes, so there are often reasons to go to different areas of the tree

437
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
In order to get between these clusters, you will generally have to allocate nodes in the attribute highways

438
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Attribute nodes allow you to pick which attribute you would like to use, so it's very easy to get points for any attribute that your gear might need

439
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:11,000
You can change which attribute these nodes give you for half price at the respec vendor

440
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,000
In addition to notables, you will also find even larger passives called keystones

441
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Keystones have both an upside and a downside, and often require changing your entire build to design around them

442
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:30,000
A great example is Giant's Blood, which allows you to wield two-hand weapons in a single hand, but doubles the attribute requirements of them

443
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,000
You can use a two-hand mace with a shield, or even dual wield them

444
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Or how about Mind Over Matter, which makes all damage go to your mana pool first before your life pool, but you lose 50% of your mana regen

445
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Skills like these can be tough to build around, but if you're up for the challenge, they can be very rewarding

446
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
As we showed you earlier on the Sorceress, you can swap between weapon sets on the fly as you use certain skills

447
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:08,000
One of the new features in Path of Exile 2's passive tree is that you can choose to have your passive tree change as you switch between weapon sets to take advantage of specific bonuses on the tree

448
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
For the Sorceress, you might want to change between fire and lightning specialization

449
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Or you could switch between one-hand and a two-hand setup in order to be able to block boss attacks while following up with heavy hits from your bigger mace

450
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Or perhaps you could have a full curse setup on your witch to debuff enemies before switching to a Chaos Degen build for maximum damage

451
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:38,000
If you want to stick with just one weapon set, you can just use these specialization points as bonus points to invest however you like

452
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
But creative players will find plenty of opportunities with this system

453
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:48,000
You can get weapon specialization points throughout the campaign from optional bosses and quests

454
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
For example, if I manage to defeat the Crowbell, I'll get a weapon specialization book

455
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
There are lots of other permanent boosts available from the campaign too

456
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
On the map you can see icons that indicate the many optional encounters you can find

457
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Some of them have permanent character boosts and others have powerful items

458
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
If you're having trouble getting past a boss, it might be a good idea to explore and see what you can find

459
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,000
For example, if you defeat Blackjaw the Remnant, you'll gain a permanent increase to fire resistance

460
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
One of the most important finds are Spirit bonuses

461
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
You can find the first one here in the canopy in Act 1

462
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Defeat the boss in this area to acquire a permanent addition of Spirit

463
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,000
The permanent buffs you gain from Spirit are very powerful and every class will find a use for them

464
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
So make sure you hunt down these upgrades. There's one in each Act

465
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Now we haven't even talked about the most important element of character progression, items

466
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
That's why we're all here, right?

467
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Items in Path of Exile can be broken down into four rarity groups

468
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Normal, Magic, Rare and Unique

469
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
One of the things you're going to want to do as you play through the campaign is upgrade the items you find

470
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And you can do that with currency items

471
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,000
An Orb of Transmutation will allow you to upgrade a normal item to a magic item with one mod

472
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
You can then apply an Orb of Augmentation to add a second mod

473
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Then use a Regal Orb to add a third mod and upgrade it to a rare

474
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Finally, you can use some Exalted Orbs to add more mods to your rare to a total of six mods

475
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
One of the things we think is really important is to make these options available to use as you play

476
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
All the items that add mods are much more common than they were in Path of Exile 1

477
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
So that you can use them throughout your campaign playthrough

478
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:32,000
We want you to find things on the ground that can be crafted into upgrades much more frequently

479
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
As well as making the drop rates on these items much more common

480
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,000
You can also get them by disenchanting unwanted gear at the magic item vendor

481
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
If you disenchant magic items you can build up to an Orb of Transmutation

482
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And by disenchanting rares you can build up to Regal Orbs

483
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Another important area of crafting items in POE 2 is sockets

484
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Some items you find will have sockets that can have Esamite runes placed in them that add more mods to the item

485
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
If I insert this Glacial Rune into my helmet it will give extra cold resistance

486
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
This is a great way to solve problems that you have with your build like resistances or damage

487
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
If you find socketed items that you don't have a use for

488
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
You can take them to the salvage bench in town to work towards an Artifices Orb

489
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
This will allow you to add sockets to your existing items

490
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Body armors and two-hand weapons can have up to two sockets

491
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,000
While the rest of your armor and one-hand weapons can only have one socket

492
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:27,000
You can also salvage items with quality to create items like armor scraps or whetstones

493
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
These will allow you to increase the quality of your items for an up to 20% boost

494
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
If you don't want to disenchant or salvage your items you can always sell them for gold

495
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Gold can be used to buy items from vendors and we've tried to do a lot to make sure that the items they have for sale are actually useful

496
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Every time you level up they get more stock so make sure to check back often

497
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Other vendors offer a gamble

498
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Pay a flat amount of gold and you'll get a random item of a specific type

499
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
This could be a great way to improve your gear if you're lucky

500
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Gold is also used to respec your passive skills

501
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Take advantage of this system to experiment with your tree and rework it as required

502
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
The other thing you might want to use gold for is the currency exchange

503
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:13,000
This allows you to exchange currency items with other players on an open market in exchange for a small gold fee

504
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Now all items in Path of Exile are freely tradable

505
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
We never bind anything to your character except gold

506
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Now most gear in Path of Exile 2 is randomly generated but there's another type that isn't

507
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Uniques

508
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:33,000
They are especially rare, each with a handcrafted set of unusual mods which can dramatically change a character's build

509
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
They're not just better rare items, they can do much stranger things that can fundamentally change your character

510
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Corpse Wade will make any corpses you run through explode into clouds of poison

511
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:51,000
The Sands of Silk is a body armor that changes your dodge roll into a blink, morphing you into sand as you teleport past your foes

512
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:58,000
And of course some uniques are just pure hits of dopamine, like Quill Reign, which just turns your bow attacks into full auto by doubling your attack speed

513
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Each unique is something that you can build your character around

514
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:08,000
We try to make sure that most unique items have a potential use at endgame, even if you find them early on

515
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And as you can see, every unique item has a potential use at endgame, even if you find them early on

516
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And as you can see, every unique item has a potential use at endgame, even if you find them early on

517
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
The last character progression system that you can do during the campaign is Ascension

518
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Starting in Act 2 you will come across Ascension trials, tests that you must complete to unlock your Ascension class

519
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
We'll explain these trials soon, but first let's take a look at what Ascending can do for your character

520
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Each class has access to 3 Ascension classes, but at the start of early access only 2 per class will be available

521
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Ascension classes are unique to each character class, so choose wisely, they can drastically affect how you build your character

522
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
As a sorceress you could become a Stormweaver, a master of the elements

523
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Tempest Caller causes elemental storms to be summoned each time you do a critical hit with a spell

524
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
With Strike twice you can stack 2 copies of Shock for more damage

525
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
And going deeper into the tree you can make all your damage types apply Shock

526
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Make a Shock build from any skill

527
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Alternatively you could become a Chrono-mancer and command Time itself

528
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
She literally has the ability to stop time with Time Freeze

529
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Not only that, but she has many other time manipulation abilities

530
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Using Temporal Rift she can teleport back to a previous location, resetting her life and mana back to what it was

531
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Or with Time Snap she can reset all her cooldowns and cast all her spells again

532
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
On the Warrior you can choose between the Warbringer or the Titan

533
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
The Warbringer channels the might of his ancestors to gain tremendous power

534
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Using Answered Call you can summon ancestral spirits linked to each of your totems

535
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,000
With Jade Heritage you can encase your body in a protective layer that absorbs all damage until it breaks

536
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Warcaller's Bellow allows you to explode the corpses of your enemies

537
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,000
And with Great Wolf's Howl you can ignore the cooldowns of your Warcries

538
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Let all that anger out

539
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
The Titan class is all about hitting big

540
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
With Earthbreaker every slam is a chance to create an aftershock

541
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
With Crushing Impacts every hit becomes a crushing blow which will allow you to stun your enemies with ease

542
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
With Surprising Strength you can take advantage of stunned enemies to deal 40% more damage

543
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
As a Ranger you might choose to be a Deadeye, an expert markswoman who can take down foes with style

544
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
With Endless Munitions every attack gains an extra projectile

545
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:45,000
With Gathering Winds she gains a small increase to movement speed with every attack, but be careful, she loses them when getting hit

546
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
With Eagle Eyes she will never miss, allowing you to stop wasting all those passive points on accuracy

547
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Alternatively you could become a Pathfinder, the master of flasks and poison

548
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:05,000
She can choose from one of several throwable concoctions, allowing her to spend her flask charges to throw explosive bottles that deal various types of damage

549
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,000
A Bleeding concoction will make your enemies bleed, while a Fulminating one can shock your enemies, allowing you to do extra damage

550
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Contagious Contamination allows her to spread poisons between her foes, while Overwhelming Toxicity doubles the number of stacks they can be infected by

551
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Running Assault allows her to move much more quickly while firing, while Relentless Pursuit makes her totally immune to being slowed by enemies

552
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
The Witch can ascend into the Infernalist or the Blood Mage

553
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
As an Infernalist she can summon a loyal Hellhound companion

554
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,000
The Hellhound sets enemies on fire, as well as taking a percentage of the damage if the Infernalist gets hit

555
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
With Pyromantic Pact you can turn your mana into Infernal Flame

556
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
As you cast more spells, the flame builds up and if it overflows you'll take damage

557
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Using Bringer of Flame you'll want to make sure you keep the flames topped up

558
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
While your Infernal Flame is above 30% all damage from you and your minions will ignite enemies

559
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
She can also transform into a literal Demon

560
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
While in Demon form she takes an increasing amount of damage, but her cast speed and damage increase rapidly as well

561
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
So if you're planning on transforming into a Demon, make sure you stack a lot of life recovery

562
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,000
She can also become a Blood Mage, a master of life and energy

563
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
All Blood Mages must pay the price of making skills cost life as well as mana

564
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
But in exchange, every monster they kill will drop Life Remnants, which allow them to quickly gain back that life

565
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:42,000
With Crimson Power she can gain large amounts of extra life, and with Vitality Siphon she can use her spells to leech life back as well

566
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Once you've got a significant amount of life, you can use Gore Spike to make your critical hits deal incredible amounts of damage

567
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
A Monk who is in tune with the elements might become an Invoker

568
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:58,000
With Elemental Expression the Invoker will create waves of elemental power each time he does a critical strike

569
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
With Faith as a choice you gain the ability to meditate, allowing you to double your energy shield

570
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Choose between I Am the Blizzard or I Am the Thunder to specialize in cold or lightning

571
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And I Shall Rage will allow you to turn into an unbound avatar

572
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Each time you apply a status ailment to an enemy you gain unbound fury

573
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:24,000
When you have enough, transform into an avatar to deal way more damage and inflict even more elemental ailments

574
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Some Monks choose to reach into the darkness instead

575
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:36,000
The Acolyte of Chaiula can exchange their Mastery of Spirit for Darkness, a resource that can be utilized to both absorb and deal damage

576
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:45,000
The Shroud of Darkness will protect you from all damage incoming, but if you take Grasp of the Void you will deal extra chaos damage from all the darkness you have

577
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Their Dark Pact offers greatly increased resistances to chaos damage and can allow their mana leech to not only happen instantly, but apply to their energy shield as well

578
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Another node you can take is Waking Dream, which allows you to see into the domain of the Breach Demons

579
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,000
There you will see the Flames of Chaiula that can be taken to gain life, mana and damage

580
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:14,000
The Mercenary has a job to do, but which job suits you? You might choose to become a Witch Hunter

581
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Obsessive Rituals will give you a Sorcery Ward, allowing you to defend yourself against elemental hits in exchange for less defense against attacks

582
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:29,000
With Zealous Inquisition your enemies have a 10% chance to explode on death, the chance is doubled against Demons and Undead

583
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:37,000
With Judge, Jury and Executioner, your initial hit against enemies can deal up to 30% of their life in damage, if you're lucky

584
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
This is great for hunting powerful bosses

585
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,000
And with Witch Bane, you can break your enemies concentration, preventing them from casting spells as often as they would usually do

586
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:53,000
You could also choose to become a Gemling Legionnaire, enhancing your abilities by embedding gems directly in your flesh

587
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Integrated Efficiency will give you extra skill slots

588
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Thermatological Infusion gives you extra maximum resistances as you socket more and more support gems

589
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Adaptive Capability allows you to use any color of gem without worrying about attributes, while Crystalline Potential adds extra quality bonuses to every gem socketed into your character

590
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:19,000
So those are the Ascenacy Classes for the start of Early Access, but one thing we haven't talked about yet is how you ascend in the first place

591
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Ascension in Path of Exile 2 requires completion of one of the Great Trials, which you'll find as you progress through the campaign

592
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Each one is associated with one of the major cultures of Rayclast

593
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Located in the Vastari Plains are the Mara'Keth, a culture of rich tales and brutal traditions who must do whatever it takes to survive in the desert

594
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,000
The highest position in Mara'Keth culture is a Sekhema, and it is not a title given freely

595
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:54,000
All aspirants must complete the Trial of the Sekhemas, a grueling gauntlet that will test their strength, will, cunning and patience

596
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:01,000
To enter, a warrior of the Mara'Keth must prove their worth by trapping the soul of a djinn in a coin, and you are no different

597
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Once you have earned your coin, it may be placed in the Relic Altar to begin the Trial

598
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
In the Trial of the Sekhemas, each room has its own challenges to overcome

599
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
In this room, each rare monster you kill will send its blood to the chalice in the center of the room

600
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Once the chalice is filled, you will be able to proceed

601
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
While fighting monsters in the Trial, you will need to be very careful

602
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Each hit will not only hurt you, but will damage your honor

603
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:43,000
The monsters are well telegraphed, so that you can avoid their attacks, but if you run out of honor, you will fail the Trial and need to find another coin in order to try again

604
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
It is a good idea to make sure that you are well prepared before challenging the Trial of the Sekhemas

605
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:58,000
After each room, you will be rewarded. In this case, you have been given a key that can be used to unlock chests later in the Trial

606
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Once you have claimed your reward, you will be shown a map of the rest of the floor and may choose how you wish to proceed

607
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Which challenges would you like to face, and which rewards do you want to claim?

608
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Some rooms are more dangerous, afflicting you with debuffs that will persist for the entire Trial

609
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:22,000
For example, entering this room will afflict you with spiked shell that will cause all monsters in the rest of the Trial to have 50% increased life

610
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
You will want to take care if you choose such a path

611
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
There are many different challenges and rewards as you journey through the Trial

612
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Deadly traps, waves of monsters, and strange artifacts will test your honor

613
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,000
As you progress, you will be able to gain boons from the Djinn, which will help you on your journey

614
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:48,000
For example, the Sekhemas Cloak will revive you once if you die, giving you a second shot at a run

615
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:56,000
One of the rewards you may find is Sacred Water, an extremely valuable and treasured resource to the Djinn and the Marraketh

616
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Trading it with the Djinn will allow you to receive many benefits. You can recover honor, gain additional boons, or remove afflictions

617
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
At the end of the floor, you will find a powerful boss which will truly test your limitations

618
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
In order to ascend, you will need to defeat him

619
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Having defeated the boss, you've earned the right to ascend, but first, the loot

620
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
The keys you have found may be used to open the various treasures in the vault at the end of the floor

621
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,000
We only have a single bronze key, so we'll just have to open one of these small chests

622
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
If you want to open the better ones, you'll need silver or gold keys

623
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Let's use the Altar of Ascendancy. Your first ascension will allow you to pick your class and grant you two points to use in the tree

624
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Now there are more floors and many more rewards that can be found within the Trial of the Sekhemas, but we'll save that for the section on the endgame

625
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
For now, let's talk about the second Ascendancy Trial, the Trial of Chaos

626
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
In Path of Exile 2, you can choose whichever trial you like to earn your ascension

627
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Each culture on Rayclast had their own methods to ascend

628
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
If the Trial of the Sekhemas is not your kind of playstyle, or you're finding it too difficult, you could try another

629
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
You can gain all your ascension points from just one, or mix and match them. It's up to you

630
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
For early access, we will have two trials as options, with a third trial coming later for the full release

631
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
While exploring the Vaal jungle, you'll discover the Temple of Chaos

632
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Before the Vaal embraced the science of corruption, their civilization worshipped chaos

633
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:35,000
This ancient trial was once used by the Vaal to test their high priests

634
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
A high priest of the Vaal must show willingness to risk everything to gain power

635
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Entry to the trial requires a token from a strange entity known only as the Trialmaster

636
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
For those in which he sees potential, he shall inscribe and ultimate him

637
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Many have attempted these trials in search of greatness, most have perished

638
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Will you be able to defy the odds?

639
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Before you begin each chamber, the Trialmaster will offer you a reward and a choice

640
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Choose one of three tribulations to affect you through the rest of the trial

641
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,000
These modifiers might beef up the monsters, curse the player, or add environmental hazards like turrets or trap runes

642
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
In this case, we will be picking Shocking Turrets

643
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
As you enter the room, the Trialmaster will fill it with hazards to test your commitment

644
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:28,000
In this case, you must destroy all the monsters that fill the room, while dealing with the lightning projectiles from the Shocking Turrets

645
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
After each room, you will need to make a choice

646
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Take the rewards you have earned so far, or go double or nothing

647
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Increase your rewards, but take on more risk

648
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Each tribulation you add is minor on its own, but they quickly stack on top of each other and can become overwhelming

649
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,000
There are many types of chambers in the trial, each will test your resolve in different ways

650
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
This one simply requires you to choose one of the three chambers to test your resolve

651
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Each chamber will test your resolve in different ways

652
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
This one simply requires you to survive for a certain amount of time

653
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Another requires you to escort the stone idol through the level as elevators full of monsters descend to attack you

654
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Should you be able to get through the first three chambers, you will face your first boss

655
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
The order of the bosses is random, and combined with the tribulations you have selected, the fight will never feel the same

656
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
After defeating the boss, you may claim your rewards

657
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Of course there are the items, but you also gain the right to ascend

658
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,000
If you already did the trial of the secondments, then you can claim two more points to add to your ascendancy class

659
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Now it's possible to go much deeper, there are more bosses, rewards and risks to take, but we'll talk more about that when we get to endgame

660
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
So how about we talk about that now?

661
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:12,000
So far we've only been showing you footage from the campaign, but some people would argue that the endgame is where the game truly begins

662
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Something that happens almost every time a new action RPG launches is people saying, there isn't enough endgame content

663
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Well, we want to make sure that in Peewee 2 people don't feel that way, and we actually only changed our development priority for this recently

664
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
The first three acts of Peewee 2 already take around 25 hours to complete if you're a new player

665
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
This is already a pretty significant campaign

666
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
On the other hand, people spend hundreds of hours in endgame each league

667
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
We realised that finishing the rest of the campaign for early access was actually a bad idea

668
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Instead of having acts 4-6 in early access, we could concentrate on endgame and make that great

669
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
For new players, a 25 hour campaign is already a huge game with lots of content

670
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
But for existing action RPG players, what you mostly care about is all the endgame challenges to overcome

671
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:59,000
So several months ago we switched the entire development team's focus over to making endgame content

672
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,000
At the start of early access there will be 50 bosses and around 100 new characters

673
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
And around 400 monster types, but the great thing is that the rest of the game is like 80% there

674
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
We'll be adding content to roughly double the size of the game during early access and inter-release

675
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Now in order to make the endgame happen at the same character level as what it would be after we added the rest of the acts

676
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:26,000
We've added a second difficulty level called Cruel, where you repeat the campaign with all the monsters and bosses levelled up

677
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
And of course new rewards

678
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
You can kind of think of it as like a new game plus

679
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,000
It's also a lot faster to get through the content the second time as your clear speed increases

680
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
That will take you to around level 65 where the endgame begins

681
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Once we add the remaining three acts we'll be removing Cruel difficulty

682
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
So you'll progress straight from the Intervax 6 to endgame

683
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
But what is the endgame?

684
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
To explain that I'll hand over to Mark, he can tell you all about it

685
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Hi, I'm Mark Roberts, game director on Path of Exile 2

686
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Well, one thing that Path of Exile is known for is having a lot of distinct endgame content to choose between

687
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Each endgame mechanic needs to have its own progression system, areas, bosses, rewards and player power that can only be gained from that content

688
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:22,000
We are going to be adding a lot more over time, but for Path of Exile 2 we decided to start with seven distinct systems you can progress through

689
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,000
This is the Atlas, and it serves as the core of the endgame for Path of Exile 2

690
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
It's infinite and expands in all directions

691
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Now we are not going to spoil the plot too much here, but corruption from the beast has blighted the land and your objective is to help fight it

692
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:45,000
In the center of the Atlas you will find the Ziggurat, a temple in which the Vaal research the fundamentals of space and time

693
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Here we can open portals to nearby locations and begin cleansing corruption and finding resources

694
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
In order to power the portal device we will need waystones

695
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Each waystone has a tear which will determine the level of the monsters that you will face

696
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:06,000
To go to an area simply click one that is adjacent to an area that you have already completed

697
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Insert the waystone and click traverse

698
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Portals will open allowing you and your party to travel to the area you have selected

699
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:20,000
All the areas in the endgame feel distinct from the locations in the campaign and we have dialled the randomisation up to 11

700
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:27,000
The monster packs you will face in each map are totally random and the combination of them can lead to some very interesting combat situations

701
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:33,000
There are over 400 monster types in early access and they have a lot of varied and interesting abilities

702
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Depending on which combinations you face you might find some serious challenges

703
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:44,000
In order to cleanse the corruption from the area you will need to defeat all the powerful rare and unique enemies in it

704
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Once you have done that the area will be marked as completed and you will be able to travel past it to progress deeper into the world

705
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:57,000
If you die then the map can no longer be run and you will have to find another way around to get to the areas behind it

706
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
There are also all kinds of other random encounters you might run into as you play maps

707
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:09,000
One such encounter are precursor artefacts. These are ancient, corrupting monuments that irradiate the monsters around them

708
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
The monsters that feed off the corruption are drawn to their power

709
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
If you defeat the monsters and cleanse the artefact you will get a powerful temporary buff

710
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Some of the buffs make you faster, others rain lightning or fire around you and some even give you increased experience or help you find better items

711
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:31,000
You can also find strong boxes. These enigmatic chests guard piles of treasure but are always a trap

712
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Monsters lie in wait to attack you the moment you open it and the boxes often have mechanisms to unleash powerful spells or dangerous debuffs

713
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:47,000
There are different types of strong boxes containing different items and you can even use your currency items to craft them on the fly so you can optimise the content

714
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
But be careful of opening one you can't handle

715
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Sometimes you'll discover monsters frozen in essences, solidified crystalline corruption

716
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:13,000
These dangerous monsters can be broken free. If you defeat them, the essence they drop can be used to upgrade normal items to magic items with a guaranteed mod from a category

717
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:20,000
For example, we could use this one on some boats to ensure a movement speed mod

718
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Rarely, essences will also drop that allow you to upgrade magics to rares adding the guaranteed mod

719
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
This is incredibly powerful since it allows you to get a second deterministic mod in your crafting projects

720
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Combining these with the currencies that are commonly found at Rayclast for modifying items and we can get a very nice pair of boots indeed

721
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Waitstones, like all items, can also be crafted using your currency items

722
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Adding prefix mods will improve the rewards while suffix mods will make it easier to craft items

723
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
The more dangerous a map is, the more waystones will drop

724
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Adding mods to your waystones is key to progressing to higher tiers and sustaining them, but it will require you to take on larger challenges

725
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
There are a variety of factors you have to consider when crafting your waystones

726
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Some maps will have higher density, some lower, some have more magic and rare chests, more monsters, some are more linear and others more open

727
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Make sure you explore and think about what makes certain maps good if you want to maximise your returns

728
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:38,000
As you cleanse corruption from higher and higher tiers of the atlas, you will gain points that you can spend in the atlas tree

729
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,000
This tree allows you to juice the danger and rewards of all areas in the endgame

730
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:51,000
You could increase the number of monsters, the number of rares, the number of precursor artifacts or strongboxes, even the quantity of items you can get

731
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:58,000
As you explore the endgame world map, you will notice various different biomes, from snowcapped mountains to dense jungle valleys

732
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Most maps are restricted to certain biomes

733
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,000
As you continue to explore deeper into the atlas, there are all sorts of things to discover

734
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:12,000
These cities are constructed by different peoples of Rayclust and have specific items that can be found there

735
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
These strange structures marked on the map don't appear to be the same as the other maps you have seen

736
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:24,000
These strange structures marked on the map don't appear to do anything for now, perhaps you'll work out how to use them later

737
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:32,000
You might find unique maps like Untainted Paradise, an undisturbed island full of beasts that give an extreme amount of experience

738
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
You may even find a lonely man just enjoying his retirement who will give you a unique item for free

739
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
In addition, you can find special areas that would make a good spot to set up camp

740
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Clear these areas off their hostile inhabitants and you'll be able to claim them as your own hideout

741
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:55,000
You can decorate your hideout as you see fit and invite various NPCs to join you there to create your own personal base of operations

742
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
A great tool for exploration are towers

743
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
These mysterious precursor constructs are dotted around the atlas

744
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Completing the tower will reveal a large area around it, allowing you to scout out your next challenge

745
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
There are lots of things to find, so keep looking

746
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Some sections of your atlas are influenced by corruption

747
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:20,000
This adds extra modifiers to the maps in the region, increasing difficulty and rewards

748
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Here, slaying monsters in close proximity to each other will cause the vestiges of corruption within them to merge together, forming powerful and grotesque abominations

749
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:35,000
You may have noticed while looking at the atlas that some of the areas have these icons above them

750
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
The icon indicates that the area contains some kind of special encounter

751
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
This icon indicates that the area has a powerful boss

752
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Because only 1 in 4 maps contain a map boss, we are able to make them very powerful and very rewarding

753
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:56,000
These bosses come from the campaign, but have had their difficulty increased with changes to AI and some of their abilities

754
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,000
It's worth noting that because you can see where the bosses are, you can choose to take them on or avoid them

755
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,000
If you do choose to hunt bosses though, then you will be rewarded with special points for the boss hunting section of the Atlas skill tree

756
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
The points here will allow you to specialise in boss killing, giving you much greater rewards for defeating them

757
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:25,000
For each different type of content in the endgame, we are adding specialised trees in order to make it so you don't feel the need to re-spec your points when you change between different types of content

758
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
We will be showing you 7 of these by the end of this presentation, so there is still a lot more to come

759
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Bosses are not the only icon you will see on the Atlas, let's take a look at one of the endgame systems, Breach

760
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
If you played PoE 1, you might be familiar with Breach

761
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
For PoE 2 we have created sequels to several PoE 1 leagues

762
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,000
While the mechanic is familiar, the monsters, bosses, rewards and progression are all new

763
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:59,000
A breach is a tear in the fabric of reality, opening it will allow you to see the demons and otherworldly monstrosities that lie in wait on this other plane of existence

764
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
By engaging with a breach, you will create a bridge between their world and Rayclast

765
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,000
In order to keep the breach open, you will need to kill the demons that pour forth

766
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,000
The faster you can kill the monsters, the more monsters you will fight and the more loot you will find

767
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,000
You can also find clasped hands that will open and drop more items if you run over them

768
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
These can be a good boost to the rewards of the breach, so keep an eye out

769
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,000
One of the rewards that you may find while fighting monsters from Breach are tablets

770
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Tablets are special items that can be used with precursor towers to add more encounters to the Atlas

771
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Breaches will drop Breach tablets

772
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Clicking on a completed tower will allow you to consume the tablet to add more breaches to areas within range of the tower

773
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
This makes all the content in the Atlas self-sustaining

774
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Want to do more breaches? Find the tablets, add them to your towers, get more breaches, getting more tablets

775
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Soon your Atlas will be covered in otherworldly domains

776
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
In addition, like all items in PoE, you can craft them

777
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Use your currency to add mods to your tablets, allowing you to upgrade all the breaches in range

778
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Tablets can have up to two mods

779
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:11,000
These mods do things like adding extra rare monsters, extra clasped hands, or even mods to density of breaches, allowing you to keep them open longer

780
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Often you will find multiple towers near to each other with overlapping areas of effect

781
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,000
This can allow you to rarely juice the mechanic by stacking them up to the top of the tower

782
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
This can allow you to rarely juice the mechanic by stacking the mods from multiple tablets

783
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
In your fight to hold the Breach demons at bay, you may want to use the powers of their world against them

784
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Each end game mechanic always has player power that can only be gained from that mechanic, and Breach is no different

785
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:44,000
In Breach you will find catalysts, items that can increase the quality of rings and amulets by improving specific mods

786
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:50,000
You can also find Breach Rings, a special base type that can have its quality improved by catalysts up to 50%

787
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
In this case you could create a ring with around 170 life

788
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Breach rings can become some of the strongest rings in the game, giving you some good motivation to face the demon hordes

789
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
In addition, each end game mechanic needs to have a pinnacle end game encounter

790
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
While killing Breach monsters you may find Breach Splinters

791
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Collect enough of these and you'll be able to create a Breach Stone

792
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Using a Vaal technology called the Realm Gate, you can use your Breach Stone to access their domain and bring the fight to them

793
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
In this twisted domain you will find nothing but a single massive Breach

794
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Triggering it will reveal hordes of Breach inhabitants

795
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
And should you be fast enough, you will be able to fight their leader, Zest, We That Are One

796
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:03,000
This is just one of the pinnacle encounters of POE 2

797
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
We won't be showing the rest of them, so you will have to discover them for yourself

798
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
But rest assured, this is some of the hardest content we have ever made

799
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
All of these encounters have spent a lot of time and effort to create a pinnacle encounter

800
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
And we hope you enjoyed it

801
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
We will be showing the rest of them, so you will have to discover them for yourself

802
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
But rest assured, this is some of the hardest content we have ever made

803
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
All of these encounters have specific uniques that can only be found from them

804
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
But that's not all, we still have the progression system

805
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Defeating Zest will give you points to allocate into the Breach section of the Atlas Tree

806
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Allocating these points will make Breaches and the Breach domain even harder, but will give you more rewards

807
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:49,000
The small nodes will increase the difficulty of the Twisted Domain, while the large nodes have more specific bonuses

808
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,000
For example, this node adds more Clasped Hands to your Breaches, and adds a pack of magic monsters that can guard them

809
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Get some more points and you can allocate Waking Nightmare, which will double the number of splinters you get from Clasped Hands

810
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
And inflict you with a mysterious debuff

811
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
In order to earn more points you will need to defeat Zest at a higher difficulty

812
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:15,000
And some rewards from Zest can only be found by increasing the difficulty of the Twisted Domain above certain thresholds

813
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Defeating Zest at difficulty 4 will be a challenge indeed, but there are many more threats in Rayclass

814
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Ritual Altars are sacrificial sites, built by the mysterious King in the Mists

815
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:34,000
If you encounter this symbol on the Atlas, then you know that the area contains Ritual Altars

816
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Ritual Altars demand tribute

817
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Every monster you slaughter in the circle will feed the altar

818
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
After the sacrifice, touch it to begin the ritual

819
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:50,000
The monsters you just killed will be resurrected by the King of the Mists' dark magic, and you must fight to survive

820
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:58,000
The tribute you have offered to the altar can be spent to buy powerful items, but they can be expensive

821
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
To gain more tribute you will want to find more altars

822
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Each successive ritual you do within an area will spawn the monsters revived by the previous ones, in addition to the ones you sacrifice next to it

823
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:16,000
By the end of an area you will be fighting a truly imposing number of foes, but will have a significant amount of tribute to spend

824
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
One of the rewards you can buy with tribute are Omens

825
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
These are special items that allow for meta-crafting

826
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Crafting items that affect other crafting items

827
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Have an item with good prefixes but bad suffixes?

828
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
This omen will help you to remove the mods you don't want while keeping the ones you do

829
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,000
There are a bunch more of these with different effects, but we will leave them for you to discover

830
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Now don't forget that Ritual will also drop tablets, which can be used to specialize into getting more rituals

831
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
If you want to get to the Pinnacle boss of Ritual, then you will probably want to use them

832
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
They can also be crafted to grant mods, making your rituals more rewarding

833
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
The Pinnacle encounter of Ritual is the King in the Mists

834
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Feared by the Asmiri people, he is said to have brought eternal darkness to the Wildwood

835
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:04,000
We won't show the encounter, but just like Breach, there are a range of unique items you can get for defeating him

836
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
And you will gain points in the Ritual section of the Atlas Tree

837
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Some maps have been touched by insanity

838
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
A mysterious entity has taken a special interest in you

839
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Step through the Looking Glass and you will find your nightmares coming to life

840
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,000
When you touch a mirror, the mists of Delirium will spread out across the area, infecting your mind

841
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:29,000
You must stay within the mist to maintain the nightmare, which is as profitable as it is terrifying

842
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Everything you kill will increase the rewards that drop

843
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
However, the deeper into the mist you travel, the stronger the monsters are

844
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Be careful not to overstay your welcome

845
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Rare and unique enemies will become vessels for terrifying demons

846
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Who will manifest out of them to unleash powerful attacks on you

847
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,000
The mist also offers a strange crafting material, Distilled Emotions

848
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
By combining these emotions you are able to instill your amulet with a notable from the passive skill tree

849
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,000
This is like gaining an extra passive point for free attached to your gear

850
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
They are also particularly great because you don't have to traverse the tree to get them

851
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Allowing you to get off-class bonuses that would normally be much harder to get

852
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Distilled Emotions can also be used to instill your endgame maps

853
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Applying Delirious to them and adding additional difficulty and rewards

854
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Allowing you to further juice your endgame maps

855
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
The tablets you can find from Delirium can be used to further improve it

856
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Increase pack size, make the fog dissipate slower, or improve your progress towards the pinnacle encounter of Delirium

857
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Speaking of which, every now and then you will find Simulacrum Splinters

858
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,000
The mysterious entity will create strange encounters based on warped versions of your own memories

859
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Monsters and Simulacrums come in waves that get progressively more difficult

860
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,000
You will receive loot at the end of each wave and you will have to make the decision to leave now or continue on

861
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Facing up against even tougher foes from the mist

862
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,000
The bosses you will face as you get deeper into a Simulacrum are truly terrifying

863
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:03,000
If you can complete a Simulacrum, you will gain points for the Delirium section of the Atlas Skill Tree

864
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Next up we have Expedition

865
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Occasionally while clearing Corruption, you will encounter these Kal-Gurren settlers

866
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
The Kal-Gurrens have discovered ancient burial sites with lost Verisium artifacts

867
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
And they want you to help dig them up with explosives

868
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,000
The Kal-Gurrens have marked the locations where the relics can be found

869
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Place explosives as best you can to dig up as many as possible

870
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
There is just one problem

871
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Corruption has brought the corpses of their ancestors to life

872
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:37,000
So you might have to do a little clean up before you can reclaim the artifacts

873
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
You can also find Remnants

874
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
The destruction of which will further anger the restless dead

875
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Each one you blow up will make the subsequent monsters more powerful but also more rewarding

876
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Danug, Rog, Tujun and Gwennan will exchange the artifacts for useful items and runic magic

877
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,000
You can also find tablets to increase the number of expeditions and the rewards

878
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
This one increases the radius of explosives

879
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
While this one increases the number of remnants you will find

880
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Eventually you might discover a Logbook

881
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
These are special maps full of buried treasure and relics

882
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Essentially one giant dig site

883
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Here you can create an extremely long chain of explosives and go through a very high number of remnants

884
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,000
But be careful

885
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Many remnants have mods that can really break your build

886
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
So you will probably want to avoid these ones

887
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
If you add too many remnants you could easily make the encounter harder than you can handle

888
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
There are all sorts of interesting things buried under the ground in Logbooks

889
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,000
You might find dripping caves and hidden pirate caches

890
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,000
But the most powerful encounter is Olroth, the ancient undead commander of the Knights of the Sun

891
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Defeating him will grant you unique rewards as well as points to spend in the expedition section of the Atlas tree

892
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
So those are the endgame systems on the Atlas but we are not done yet

893
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
The trials we talked about earlier have much more content when you get to endgame 2

894
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Just like the other endgame systems, they also have progression mechanics, unique rewards and player power that can only be gained from them

895
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,000
As you get higher level coins for the trial of the Sekimas, you will unlock more floors to explore

896
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Each floor has its own challenging brooms and a floor boss that you will need to kill

897
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:40,000
There are four floors in total, leading to another pinnacle boss at the end of the last floor which can only be accessed at endgame

898
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:45,000
The trial of the Sekimas is where you'll find jewels, which you can socket into your tree

899
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
These are like passives that you can craft with your currency items

900
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:54,000
They can be really powerful as they allow you to stack modifiers that may not be easily accessible on the tree normally

901
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
This jewel gives lightning damage and shock chance for example

902
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
There are quite a few jewel sockets on the tree so it's possible to gain a lot of power here

903
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:09,000
There are also other types of jewels that don't provide any bonuses themselves but affect other passives surrounding them

904
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,000
This jewel increases the effect of small nodes and radius by 25%

905
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,000
With careful placement in the tree, you could get a significant amount of power from it

906
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:24,000
There are also unique jewels available with very interesting effects, but you will have to find those for yourself

907
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:32,000
In order to push further into the trial and uncover the secrets of the Marakev, you will want to take advantage of its progression system, relics

908
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Relics are items that can be placed in the relic altar as you start the trial

909
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,000
They give special bonuses that affect the trial, making it easier and increasing its rewards

910
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Of course, you can craft these with your currency items, making them even stronger

911
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:54,000
If you can complete the entire trial overcoming all four floors, the final boss will reward you with one of many unique relics

912
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:00,000
These relics will be consumed when used on your next run, but can reward you with unique and powerful items

913
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
For example, this is the Last Flame

914
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:09,000
If you use it, you will have only one honor for the entire trial, so you will need to do a completely hitless run

915
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
The Trial of Chaos also extends into the endgame

916
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:21,000
As you gain inscribed ultimatums of higher and higher levels, the number of chambers that you can go through increases

917
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:26,000
In true Vaal style, this allows you to take even more risks for even more rewards

918
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,000
At endgame, you can progress through up to 10 chambers with 3 bosses on a single run

919
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Stacking 10 tribulations on top of each other will make this a significant challenge, but it's worth it

920
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,000
The Trialmaster will tempt you with items of the Vaal empire, such as Vaal Orbs

921
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Vaal Orbs are powerful crafting items that corrupt your gear with random mysterious outcomes

922
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Corruption prevents an item from being modified further, so it has to be the last step of your craft, but it's also the most impactful one

923
02:07:54,000 --> 02:08:02,000
For example, if you use one on your body armor, it might add a new powerful enchantment, or it might reroll up to half of its modifiers

924
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Vaal Orbs also have the ability to add a socket, allowing you to bypass the normal restriction of how many sockets an item can have

925
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:15,000
A body armor could get up to 3 sockets this way, allowing for a significant number of mods

926
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Vaal Orbs can even modify uniques

927
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Adding enchantments or sockets to uniques can make them incredibly powerful, but there is a good chance that you will break them as well

928
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:29,000
The Trialmaster will also occasionally offer you Soul Cores

929
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Originally formed by Chaos, the Vaal sought to replicate Soul Cores through human sacrifice rituals and blood magic to power their civilization

930
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Soul Cores are powerful socketable items, with mods that cannot be obtained from regular runes

931
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Like all endgame content, there is of course a pinnacle boss

932
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
The final chamber will drop keys to this mysterious door

933
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Some say this is where the Trialmaster himself resides

934
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Perhaps you are willing to take the risk to find out

935
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Had enough yet? Because there is still just one more thing

936
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
The most difficult content in Path of Exile 2

937
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:13,000
While mapping you might come across this fortress that has emerged from underground, surrounded by an enormous maze riddled with danger

938
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Is the maze preventing something from getting in? Or something getting out?

939
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:26,000
This fortress is of ancient origin and its construction has similarities to the towers and tablets that you have been using on your journey through the endgame

940
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
It is clear from the entrance that there are 3 keys required to enter

941
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Local factions are vying for access to the fortress in order to seize the power they believe will be inside

942
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Each of the faction's leaders have managed to get their hands on one of the keys, so you will need to defeat them

943
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Each faction is led by an Uber Act boss

944
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:50,000
You can see one of them inhabiting the city, but in order to fight him you will first need to defeat their 2 lieutenants in the adjacent zones

945
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Be careful, if you fail against either of the lieutenants or to kill the leader they will move on and you will need to find them again

946
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Kill all the Uber bosses and you will gain access to the fortress

947
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,000
We aren't going to spoil it as we can't wait to see you guys attempt it for the first time

948
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:10,000
But is there a tree you get points in after killing it? Of course there is. This is Path of Exile, there is always another tree

949
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:18,000
So these are your challenges for POE 2. As you can see, this project is crazy huge, way bigger than even we expected when we started out

950
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
But how do you gain access?

951
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Well, during early access you will need a key to get in

952
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:30,000
To thank our existing POE supporters who have spent more than $480 USD, we will be giving you guys a key for the PC version for free

953
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Anyone else who wants one can get one by purchasing one of the new early access supporter packs that have just been released to the store

954
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,000
If you just want early access to POE 2, then you can get a key in the $30 USD early access pack

955
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
The pack also comes with $30 USD of points to spend in the MTX store

956
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:54,000
But we also have a variety of other supporter packs filled with exclusive microtransactions, points to spend in the store and even physical items

957
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:00,000
The cosmetics can be used right now in POE 1 and in Path of Exile 2 in early access starts

958
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Most of this footage has been recorded in Path of Exile 1, since that's where you can use them immediately

959
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:11,000
The Lord of Ogham supporter pack contains a cosmetic armour set befitting of the Count of Ogham himself

960
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:17,000
There is also a matching back attachment which has an alternate variant depicting the influence of corruption

961
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Also in this pack you can find a portal formed of the rusted armour of the fallen soldiers in the Red Veil of Ogham

962
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
And the offspring of a vicious crowbell boss found in the hunting grounds

963
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
This one doesn't look so vicious though

964
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:40,000
On top of that you'll receive the Iron Counts as Y-Hander to apply to your one-handed or two-handed swords

965
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:45,000
For those who are wanting to decorate your hideouts with fond memories and tales of Path of Exile's history

966
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
You will also get a series of hideout statues

967
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
This pack contains the Statue of Hillock

968
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
For Path of Exile 1's closed beta, each pack contained a true New Zealand icon, the Kiwi

969
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Following this tradition, all packs in this series will also contain a new themed Kiwi pet

970
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
The pet will loyally follow you into battle, but run away at the first sign of trouble

971
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Become the ruler of the desert with the King of the Faridun supporter pack

972
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Show your mastery of traversing the sands of the Vasteri Plains

973
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:18,000
The body armour will allow you to glide along the ground with ancient sand magic

974
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Now each armour set comes with body armour, boots, gloves and helmet

975
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
But the boots are covered in sand

976
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
If you'd prefer to show them off, you can turn the gliding off if you want

977
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:36,000
The accompanying back attachment equips you with two powerful pillars that can control and manipulate lightning

978
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
They will periodically release their energy in a powerful blast while in town

979
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
And hover in a circle around you, arcing lightning between them forming a barrier of energy

980
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Replace the appearance of any bow with the Faridun's glory skin

981
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Or replace the appearance of a spear with the Tyranese End Spear skin

982
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
This spear skin can be applied to staves and war staves in Path of Exile 1

983
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:09,000
If you want to truly show your worth as a King of the Faridun, then you definitely need your trusty, moving, entire city fortress known as the Dreadnought to travel across the Vasteri Plains

984
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,000
In Path of Exile you can decorate your hideout however you like, and it's no exception here

985
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
It comes with a variety of thematic elements to use, or use decorations from elsewhere in the game

986
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Additionally, you will get the Deshret's Blessing Level Up effect

987
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
The King of the Faridun Kiwi Pet

988
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,000
And last but not least, a statue depicting the Vaal Oversoul from Path of Exile 1

989
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,000
For those who don't know how our supporter packs work, each pack comes with all of the cosmetics from the previous tier

990
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
So you will get all the items from the Lord of Ogham supporter pack as well

991
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:53,000
The Thaumaturge of the Vaal supporter pack features an armour set and back attachment themed around the Vaal and their pursuit of science and progress

992
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:01,000
You can find the Soul Core Weapon effect in this pack, which causes Thaumaturgic energy harnessed from sacrifice to spill from your weapon

993
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
This pack also contains Doryani's Idol

994
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:11,000
It replaces the default appearance of any foci to an ancient relic once used by Doryani, and this can be applied to shields in Path of Exile 1

995
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:20,000
That's not the only Vaal weapon you'll find, it also contains the Wand of the Thaumaturge skin, and the Royal Sacrifice Dagger skin

996
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
You wouldn't think to put sacrificial gems on a Kiwi, but the Vaal did

997
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Thaumaturge of the Vaal supporters will receive the Thaumaturge of the Vaal Kiwi Pet, and the Statue of Dominus

998
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
This is also the first pack in the series with a physical item

999
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:44,000
When purchasing this pack you'll receive a Path of Exile 2 logo t-shirt, but if you don't want one, you can opt out and return for additional points to spend in the store

1000
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Becoming a Warlord of the Kaerui supporter will grant you an armour set and back attachment, adorned in jade carvings and iridescent feathers resembling power

1001
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Enough to even impress the ancestral gods, specifically Tuukohama, the Kaerui god of war

1002
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Overkill you say? I think the Kaerui people would disagree

1003
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Why not drop a gigantic totem on rare enemies you slay to crush them to a pulp?

1004
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Replace your crafting bench in your hideout with the Ancestral Canoe crafting bench, where Ancestral Chief Marta will summon a giant canoe manned by Kaerui warriors to aid in your crafting desires

1005
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,000
You'll also get a pair of weapon skins

1006
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Equip Akoya's Falling Axe skin to your one-handed or two-handed axes, or Tuukohama's Crusher to your one-handed or two-handed maces

1007
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:37,000
A true Kaerui Warlord is always accompanied by their trusty Kiwi

1008
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Once one of the most feared beings in Rayclass, Malachai was slain by a powerful Exile

1009
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:47,000
May the statue commemorate the virtue of Exile's past, present and of the future

1010
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Of course it's not all about dressing up in game, you'll want to look good in real life too

1011
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:56,000
By becoming a Warlord, you'll be able to get a lot of experience and experience

1012
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,000
You'll be able to get a lot of experience and experience

1013
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Of course it's not all about dressing up in game, you'll want to look good in real life too

1014
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:09,000
By becoming a Warlord of the Kaerui supporter, you'll also get a Path of Exile 2 hoodie

1015
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Our final tier of supporter pack in this series is the Liberator of Rayclass supporter pack

1016
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:23,000
The Liberator of Rayclass armour set and back attachment come made with the finest materials in Rayclass, and shattered glass mosaics suspended in divine power

1017
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Set up your base of operations in the Beacon of Salvation hideout

1018
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Set up your base of operations in the Beacon of Salvation hideout

1019
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Why restrict yourself to just one island when you can liberate more?

1020
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:39,000
The Beacon of Salvation hideout comes equipped with your own collection of small islands and personal operators of boats that you can use to row between them

1021
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Just walk to the piers, click a boat to enter and navigate as you choose

1022
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Decorate each island as you see fit to best represent your well-earned hideout

1023
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Everyone in your hideout can use their own boat, why not have some races?

1024
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,000
You can also get the Window to Twilight portal effect

1025
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:01,000
A beautiful mosaic piece of art that shatters and reveals a gateway to your desired destination as you approach it

1026
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
As you walk away, the glass magically reforms back to its original form

1027
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Rule in style with the Throne of the Ruler map device

1028
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Sure, this map device can create portals to endgame maps, but it also comes with a throne you can sit on to oversee your growing kingdom

1029
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Look down on the plebeians running your maps

1030
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Being the Liberator though is not just about sitting in your throne all day

1031
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:28,000
If you do decide to join the fight yourself, you can leave a high priest in charge to second in command

1032
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Liberator of Rayclass supporters will also get a set of varied weapon skins

1033
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
The Light of Divinity Scepter skin

1034
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
The Deliverance Crossbow skin

1035
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
The Justice Flail skin

1036
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
And the Redemption Shield skin

1037
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Once again you'll have an accompanying Kiwi, and of course a statue depicting one of the most iconic events in Rayclass's history

1038
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
The battle between a powerful Exile and Kitava, the insatiable

1039
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:01,000
With the help of two deities, Sin and Innocence, the Exile was able to defeat him once and for all

1040
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
This supporter pack also contains the Path of Exile 2 artbook

1041
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:14,000
This 215 page full colour artbook includes a huge amount of amazing concept art and lore produced during the long and exciting journey of Path of Exile 2's development

1042
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:21,000
And finally, Path of Exile has a tradition of letting the community participate in designing game features

1043
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
For Path of Exile 2 we'll be adding the Twilight Order Foil Reliquary

1044
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:36,000
By becoming a Liberator of Rayclass supporter, once Path of Exile 2 is released you will be able to select any unique item you have found and be able to drop it from the Reliquary

1045
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Once players have submitted their items, keys to the Reliquary will start dropping

1046
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:46,000
And other players will be able to find foil versions of uniques that you have submitted along with a message for the lucky player

1047
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:52,000
The more players submit the same unique, the more chances there will be for the Reliquary to drop them, so choose wisely

1048
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Now almost all of these items are available to use in POE 1 right now

1049
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:01,000
There are a few exceptions where the item class clearly doesn't exist, such as crossbows or flails

1050
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
And there are also a few microtransactions on weapon types that are unavailable in POE 2 at the start of early access

1051
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Once classes that use those weapon types are added, those microtransactions will be available to use

1052
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:18,000
If you can't decide which supporter pack to choose yet, you can always start with the Early Access Supporter Pack that just includes a key and some points to spend in the store

1053
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Then you can upgrade to any of the following tiers at a later date

1054
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,000
These Supporter Packs will be available for purchase throughout early access

1055
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:31,000
We'd really like to thank you for your ongoing support. Without you guys, Path of Exile 2 could not have happened

1056
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Now, I'm sure you guys have a lot of questions. Stick around, because coming up next we have a live Q&A with Ziggy D

1057
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Welcome to the post show discussion and Q&A. I hope you all enjoyed what you've seen so far

1058
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:12,000
It's been pretty exciting for us here as well as you guys have been inspired already just watching things

1059
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
And you're already cooking a new ascendancy class

1060
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Yeah, for sure

1061
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
You've got to do design whenever you can

1062
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Absolutely, there's been a few fun moments here already

1063
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I'm your host Ziggy D and I'm joined by Jonathan and Mark to talk about everything you've seen

1064
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Honestly, it's so much

1065
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I mean, we were really keen to make sure that when we went into early access that people didn't feel like it was just limping along and kind of just like a minimum amount of content

1066
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,000
We really wanted to kind of blow people away. So hopefully people feel like, yeah, there is enough content

1067
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Because it was certainly a mission to get all that stuff in

1068
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Yeah, I did come here expecting that there would be, you know, maybe a basic mapping placeholder end game and your three acts and, you know, the half the classes

1069
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:03,000
But you've made a decision here, clearly, that's got to go the core POE player community in mind

1070
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Absolutely. So, I mean, we have to make sure like, I mean, look, Path of Exile's end game is kind of known for the fact you get to choose between different types of content and that like, you know, some people enjoy one thing, some people enjoy another

1071
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:21,000
And I feel like that choice is like a huge part of what makes it good. So if we didn't have that when we entered the end game, then I don't think that would be, you know, like that wouldn't be a Path of Exile end game

1072
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:33,000
So that's kind of what we have to make sure of. So we kind of said, okay, well, like, what is the minimum number of like different end game things you need to be able to have in order to be able to actually have a viable end game that you feel like you get different choices?

1073
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
And that's how we ended up with what we have here

1074
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:45,000
I definitely feel like a lot of games nowadays release, you know, and their campaigns intact real good, you get to the end game and it just falls real flat

1075
02:21:46,000 --> 02:22:04,000
And it was certainly a very important moment for us when we were like, hold on, that's the wrong thing to do. Like, let's not make the same mistake as everyone else, let's pivot. And we actually did that and like, it made a world of difference and made the game all of a sudden, you know, a hundred times bigger with an infinite amount more content, right?

1076
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:25,000
It was definitely hard though, because like, okay, like, so we're, you know, we're progressing, it's like, we would have made it, we would have gotten, you know, all these acts in if we hadn't have changed direction. It's like to actually say, you know what, we're going to specifically not finish this content we'll be working on, you know, that we, you know, it's like pens down everyone, we're stopping work on this, we're going to move over to end games is actually more important. Like that was certainly a hard one.

1077
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,000
That would have been some whiplash there, I imagine.

1078
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:37,000
I mean, it's like suddenly the whole, you know, like environment art team, it's like, you know, they're all just like, whatever you're working on, just scrap, you don't want to scrap, but you know, just stop it. We're doing something else now.

1079
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Saving clothes, yeah.

1080
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Especially for a lot of the developers, because you got to also think like a lot of our developers have just been working on this campaign for, what is it now, six years.

1081
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
I think it's even longer.

1082
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Yeah, it's like just this epic journey. Whereas none of them, you know, a lot of these people haven't been working on Path of Exile 1 this whole time.

1083
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:03,000
So some of us are like, you know, we're just churning out end game with every league and doing all of that. But for a lot of these people, a lot of these developers, yeah, it was quite jarring to swap over.

1084
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:11,000
But everyone embraced it, you know, we talked about it, everyone was happy about it and stoked about it and it just ended up coming out real awesome.

1085
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I think it's landed well and it definitely kind of blew me away when you, even before I saw anything, we were in the car on the drive here and you were just info dumping all of the end game.

1086
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:28,000
You're like, oh, we've got this feature, we've got this feature. I'm getting dopamine just from hearing about it. I haven't even seen anything yet.

1087
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,000
But do you guys feel like you're competing against yourselves a little bit here? Because Path of Exile's kind of set the bar.

1088
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:38,000
The original game has set the bar for what is available to end game in a game like this.

1089
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:44,000
And it makes it's not acceptable really to launch with just nothing in terms of end game now.

1090
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Absolutely. I mean, yeah, I mean, like if you're not competing with yourself, then I don't think you're going to make good progress. Right. So that's what you really have to do.

1091
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Yeah. But cracking that out for beta even.

1092
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Yep, absolutely. I just think it would not have landed nearly as well without that.

1093
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:02,000
And I think it's important that our existing Path of Exile 1 community feels like they're also served.

1094
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Like, yeah, sure, we're doing all this stuff for new players and that's really important and that'll expand the audience.

1095
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:11,000
But, you know, if we launched and all the PUE1 players are unhappy, that wouldn't be good.

1096
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:18,000
So, you know, we have to make sure that they also feel like, you know, they've got a game for both them and for all the new players we hope to bring to the genre.

1097
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:22,000
And you definitely want all those different axes as well. Like just having two, right?

1098
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:26,000
You'll get a lot of a lot of content can be immediately divisive, right?

1099
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Obviously, that's the nature of it. That's how it goes. Right.

1100
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:34,000
And so you have all of these different avenues because there are different players who like different types of content.

1101
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:41,000
So if you just say here's your one end game system. Well, immediately then there is a proportion of players who decide, I don't want this.

1102
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Right. And so having all of these options is like ultra key. And that is what Path of Exile 1 has taught us.

1103
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:54,000
And again, it's like I'd say lessons learned for the genre and it is expanding and other games and stuff.

1104
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:06,000
But, yeah, certainly, as you said, competing with ourselves. Yes, PUE1 has, you know, 40 axes, you know, and we've got seven really good ones here and obviously more to come.

1105
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,000
But seven is a lot, mind you.

1106
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Especially when it's all like, you know, like people have to learn a lot of things again.

1107
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:18,000
It's going to be very interesting to see how long it takes people to do the kind of difficulty for pinnacle content.

1108
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Yeah, yeah. It's like we have to. It's honestly like we actually don't even really know because like you never know what people are going to find in terms of builds and so on.

1109
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Like I'm hoping that it will take people a while to be able to work it out. But, you know, you never know.

1110
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Maybe end of day one people just, oh, yeah, easy. No problem.

1111
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
You know, could be what it's like.

1112
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:41,000
There are a few people that are doing that sort of thing. I saw like a solo cell phone level 100 in 24 hours or something.

1113
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Geez. OK, we got this is where we've got it now, is it?

1114
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
So I imagine there'll be a little bit of a soft reset there for a reloading period.

1115
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,000
There's stuff to learn.

1116
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:55,000
And I mean, POE 2 has changed a lot over the years, so more than five years of development now.

1117
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:01,000
And what was that initial pitch when POE 2 was first put forwards, like as to what it's going to be?

1118
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Because it was much smaller in scope originally.

1119
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Yeah. So when we started, it wasn't even a sequel. It was just we're just updating the character rigs.

1120
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,000
And over time, it kind of feature creeped into a proper into a proper scene.

1121
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:19,000
But the thing that we were saying is whenever we were talking about it, and I guess this is the main thing, is that we're like, OK, when we make an area here,

1122
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:22,000
it needs to be that there's like a theme for it. It feels unique from everything else.

1123
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:28,000
We're not going to just like have recycled stuff like within the campaign that just feels like, oh, you know, we just took this area and modified it slightly.

1124
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,000
You know, each one's got to have its own stuff.

1125
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:33,000
It's got to have monsters that were like carefully thought about that, like, you know, fit in with the world.

1126
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:38,000
And it's got to have bosses that are actually like good tier quality, you know, every area is going to have one.

1127
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:50,000
And so those decisions has kind of been things that have meant that like they really raised the quality bar to a level that took us way longer than we even really expected.

1128
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Like the those things there just like they it's huge. Right.

1129
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Like honestly, I feel like we underestimated significantly what it would take to deliver that level of quality.

1130
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,000
I remember really early on a battle I fought for.

1131
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:13,000
And I mean, like way back was like, if you think back to say Diablo 2, which obviously still holds a lot of power in terms of design motivations and philosophy and stuff within the company,

1132
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:17,000
you get things like the super uniques and PRW1 did them.

1133
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:20,000
And it's just like, here's a boss with one or two skills.

1134
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,000
And I remember very, very, very early on in PRW2.

1135
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I'm like, I want every single boss to be memorable and a thing.

1136
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I don't want a unique monster that's just like dies in two seconds and uses heavy strike and has a fancy name.

1137
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:46,000
And I remember I even got some push back at the time and thinking like, you know, I love the bosses, my favorite part of everything.

1138
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
And so I was just like, I really don't want this.

1139
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
This is just terrible.

1140
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:56,000
And but of course, that decision, me pushing for that, me wanting that turned into this megalithic.

1141
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Now we have 50 aiming to be 100.

1142
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Honestly, probably later several more 100 once all the end games, everything start to evolve and more expansions comes out.

1143
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:11,000
And I'm like, yep, we maybe just made, you know, 100 times more work for ourselves,

1144
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:18,000
but 100 percent bloody worthwhile because I'd say those bosses are one of the main, you know, attraction pieces of the game.

1145
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:23,000
And if anyone who plays it is just like, holy crap, those boss fights are amazing.

1146
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:28,000
So like, you know, obviously some bad and some are good to different people and all that.

1147
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
That's how it all goes. That's part of all the fun.

1148
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,000
But it is true that me pushing for that thing literally created thousands and thousands and thousands of hours of work.

1149
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Now worthwhile work.

1150
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
It's worthwhile work.

1151
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
But it is again, that exact thing of like this.

1152
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
The scope is kind of small on numerous axes.

1153
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:50,000
And as we just raised and raised the quality bar to what we thought was good, it certainly went from, you know, what was it initially?

1154
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Just rescuing some character classes and new rigs or whatever into this like mega scale and high campaign.

1155
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Yeah, everything.

1156
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Full standalone separate game.

1157
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Yeah, fun, fun other anecdotes since we went out of that territory, it was originally codenamed Project Chimera.

1158
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
What? I don't know.

1159
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
It was this pipe dream.

1160
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I've never been a fan of these code name things.

1161
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:22,000
It was this like, there were times way back in the original office, there was all this like, sometimes there'll be a feature you can't really do in Peewee One.

1162
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,000
And it was always like, ah, we'll do it in Project Chimera.

1163
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
That was like amongst the developers.

1164
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
And people were like, what the heck is that?

1165
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Now, ironically, there is a boss in Act 3 called, well, it's got a different name, but it's called the Chimera internally.

1166
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
It is a Chimera. It's a multi headed beast.

1167
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:45,000
And you've seen in a few of the marketing, you know, things here and here, different trailers, little snippets of it.

1168
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:51,000
And I think it's just ironic that that was actually the first boss asset made before everything.

1169
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:55,000
The first monster because back in when we used to make random monsters and we'll find out how to use them.

1170
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
And that was made for that game.

1171
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
It was used in the original Peewee Two trailer.

1172
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Right.

1173
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:07,000
It is the only incomplete, technically, but only from a balancing or was the last boss to finish in the entire path of Exile.

1174
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:11,000
It sounds like it was like some sort of emotional demon that you had to battle there.

1175
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Like the legacy of the original idea and you had to finish it.

1176
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:19,000
We had a moment with the monster game designers where we're like, oh my God, it's happening.

1177
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
The Chimera is finally being finished.

1178
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Holy. This is like, yeah, we were effectively like we need to celebrate this boss finally being done.

1179
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
It was like at the origin.

1180
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:35,000
And now it's at this point where we're about to deploy early access, you know, not to say the end because the end is forever away.

1181
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Yeah. Yeah.

1182
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
It's still the beginning of a journey in many ways.

1183
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:46,000
But on that note of celebrating, like, how do you guys feel having now kind of for the first time, I feel really like laid bare kind of everything you have.

1184
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:51,000
You're putting it out there and only being two weeks away from everyone playing it.

1185
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Well, it's always scary, you know, coming into a release.

1186
02:30:54,000 --> 02:31:01,000
And I think especially for, you know, there's like a bunch of people on the POE2 team who have, you know, like they have this is their first game that they're going to be releasing.

1187
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:06,000
And that experience is something that, you know, like, yeah, like it's tough.

1188
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:15,000
And honestly, I think that even we were feeling a little bit cocky actually about the fact because, you know, we release, you know, you know, content for POE1 all the time.

1189
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:19,000
And I feel like we kind of felt like we knew what it took to get a game released.

1190
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:24,000
But honestly, like POE2 was just a whole entirely different demon as far as getting things out.

1191
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Right. Like it's just way more difficult.

1192
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Like when you actually have to make everything like the whole fricking thing right, right from the ground up again.

1193
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
It's like, wow, there's there's way more stuff there.

1194
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:41,000
And like there's even things like like the passive tree where it's like, I feel like we underestimated what it would take to get something like that to an actual releasable state.

1195
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:47,000
That was a huge amount of work, just like absolutely colossal to get it to, you know, to get that kind of stuff in shape.

1196
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Like it was it's just been crazy.

1197
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:55,000
So, yeah, like obviously it's nerve wracking, you know, coming up to coming up to a release day.

1198
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,000
But I think we do have something that players are going to really enjoy.

1199
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:07,000
And, you know, like it's always comforting when, you know, I mean, we had a live event in L.A. recently, you know, people, you know, we got to the time loop and everyone's like, oh, man, we don't want to stop.

1200
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,000
You know, so I think people are going to really enjoy it.

1201
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:23,000
It's been a whole different experience for me here playing this time around as well, whereas before I was playing a very buggy kind of internal version of the game that was very experimental now playing, you know, almost what I'm going to be playing.

1202
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I heard you still managed to blow the count up the elevator with some kind of top back bug.

1203
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,000
What was I going to mention?

1204
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Yeah, we have to just keep it that way.

1205
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I did send the Act 1 boss up an elevator with knockback.

1206
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
It was intended mechanic.

1207
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
It was pretty funny.

1208
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:41,000
He was in his like big wolf form and kind of trapped in there.

1209
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:45,000
So just barking at me through the through the wood.

1210
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:49,000
So if you feel I'm sure there's a few things to work out of this next two weeks.

1211
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I hope the team can have a little bit of a rest for a day before they get back into it.

1212
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Yeah, it's been it's been a lot.

1213
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:01,000
So you've done that pivot to the end game focus and got so much for us now to play around with in the beta.

1214
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:07,000
And it seems like originally I was thinking, you know, we might be playing for a few weeks here and then, you know,

1215
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
maybe going back over to some public one stuff.

1216
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
It seems like you guys want us playing through Christmas.

1217
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
That would certainly be good.

1218
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I mean, look, there's enough stuff there.

1219
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
I think it will take people a long time to get through.

1220
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,000
And I mean, obviously, it's also going to be the first time people playing through a completely fresh campaign as well.

1221
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I think that will take people a fair amount of time.

1222
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:25,000
So, yeah, there's and then, of course, the end game as well to explore.

1223
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I mean, yeah, it should be pretty significant.

1224
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I mean, we've always wanted it to be that Path of Exile two leagues, you know, are going to be, you know, like how P1 leagues are.

1225
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
We like you play them and you play them for like, you know, a reasonable amount of time.

1226
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
And then, you know, sure, you get done with them eventually.

1227
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
And then you've got the next content that comes out.

1228
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:47,000
So, yeah, in order to be able to realize that you have to have enough of a base to make that happen.

1229
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Yeah, people definitely wondering like how invested they can get in the beta.

1230
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:54,000
So I do want to ask a few questions kind of around that idea.

1231
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:00,000
So is firstly, is there going to be wipes and resets and will there be something before launch as well?

1232
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:09,000
So we are going to be having new like leagues effectively throughout the beta whenever we launch something significant because, you know, we want to make sure that all of the effectively that people are able to play through.

1233
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:17,000
But that stuff will be merged into an early access league and effectively after we go into full release, that league will stick around.

1234
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Now, I can't promise that everything about your character will function exactly like how it did in that thing.

1235
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:27,000
I imagine it would be a glorious kind of snapshot of all of the he's all broken stuff.

1236
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,000
But effectively, we can contain all that stuff in the sort of early access league.

1237
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:34,000
And then if you still want to play those characters, you know, like then you can go out ahead and do that.

1238
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,000
But, you know, the action is always going to be in whatever the most recent league is.

1239
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:46,000
And then, of course, after that point, there'll be a standard that everything goes into, which, you know, all our economic sins will forevermore be archived in the standard.

1240
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:49,000
So, yeah, that's, you know, no doubt.

1241
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Well, it's nice that it's a not going to be affecting what will be the standard.

1242
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Also, people will be able to kind of get invested in their characters.

1243
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's even something kind of cool about the idea of making something that will be like that little historical.

1244
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Absolutely. A little collectible.

1245
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Absolutely. And I'm sure there'll be some handful of legacy things that only exist in the early access league.

1246
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:10,000
So, you know, I guess we'll have to see what gives a unique balance.

1247
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:15,000
You talked about like the, you know, playing for a week or how long are we expecting?

1248
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:24,000
We sort of remember and a lot of the, you know, a lot of the P1 players, we're thinking very differently to people who are obviously going to experience this as a new game, but it is a new game.

1249
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Right. You don't have all these predefined hyper refined builds to play to immediately, you know, go through things.

1250
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:37,000
You don't have people coming in with like fully detailed 7 million line, but with build guides of exactly what to do with what items.

1251
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
The discovery is going to be there.

1252
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:43,000
The discovery takes time and the discovery is like honestly ultra fun for me.

1253
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:47,000
I love it. Now those things will emerge after time.

1254
02:35:47,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Of course they do completely fine. But you should remember like there's a lot of game to play here to discover, to learn, learn about the world, the new narratives, the new world building, the new unique items, the ascenity classes, the massive passive tree, which is bigger than P1s.

1255
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:17,000
The like, you know, end game systems, the bosses that it's it's not going to be this like, you know, even, you know, personally when I pay we one Lee comes out, for example, I play for like a month, sometimes a bit longer, sometimes a bit less.

1256
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:21,000
It ultimately also depends largely what's going on here and how much I need to invest here.

1257
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:27,000
So, you know, and there are other people who play for more like three and whatnot, but there's certainly going to be a much longer time period.

1258
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:31,000
You can play this for while still discovering new stuff and not feel like you're finished.

1259
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:34,000
You know what I mean? Now, of course, you see that subjective.

1260
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Everyone can pick their own point when they finish.

1261
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:41,000
But if you want to see everything and do everything, you're going to be investing a lot more time, especially these first time rounds.

1262
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,000
And then obviously with every league, there's more to discover.

1263
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,000
But you get faster at doing all these parts over and over and over again.

1264
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,000
You'll get more efficient over time. That's how the game works.

1265
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:59,000
So, yeah, I would expect a lot of time to be sunk into this to fully explore it to start with like a lot, you know, not a week, not two weeks.

1266
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:03,000
You're going to be going far, far longer than that if you want to see everything.

1267
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:08,000
You know, it's up to you play at your own pace, see how you want to go, learn at your own pace.

1268
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:15,000
That's the that's the beauty of a new game as well, which we haven't been able to experience the path of XR1, you know, or other games.

1269
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:21,000
And for so long is actually discovering the entire world.

1270
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
And there's some familiar mechanics at the end game and stuff like that, which is awesome for people.

1271
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:33,000
But, yeah, I certainly want to really I'm very excited to see people discovering the new things and getting so excited about it.

1272
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:37,000
I can tell you're amped for watching people go through that discovery process.

1273
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I may be even 100 percent.

1274
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:44,000
I mean, I love sitting there in part of building as many as many of us do.

1275
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:47,000
But I am very excited for that.

1276
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:52,000
But as we're saying, the discovery process for a while, I think you were saying how much you were part spreadsheet.

1277
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:57,000
I think I'm like I think I was saying I'm like maybe 60 percent spreadsheet, 40 percent discovery.

1278
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:04,000
And there's my play archetype, you know, so I'm not without player profiles and Timmy Spikes and things like that.

1279
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
We're both exalted characters.

1280
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
The discovery part of me is ultra excited.

1281
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:13,000
And I know, mind you, that's coming from someone who kind of knows all the content.

1282
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:24,000
I'm still because there's something different about making it versus actually playing it live with the players, seeing them discover it, Unix being linked in chat and on Reddit and all that is just so, so, so cool.

1283
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
We're going to get a massive dose of that.

1284
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:33,000
And it is like genuinely exciting to see how people are going to think, you know, what's worth one chaos or what's with 10 chaos, what's worth a hundred.

1285
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:39,000
If chaos is chaos, even the currency that people are arguing about this.

1286
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:47,000
I'm pretty sure that one C spam and chat might turn into one E because I, you know, one exalt, you given that exalt is now I think it'll be chaos.

1287
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:50,000
People probably have removal still be people don't appreciate it, by the way.

1288
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:56,000
So when we say we're going to be getting multiple exalts in act one in in POE two, like we actually have increased that a lot.

1289
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,000
It's not just like an idle, you know, like I can see exalts becoming the new kind of like chaos.

1290
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Yeah, I think I actually agree.

1291
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
But yeah, we'll see.

1292
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
But it's a new economy, right?

1293
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Like who knows the market will have to like they were already arguing about.

1294
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:15,000
It's good fun.

1295
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:21,000
So do you have some kind of like beta release roadmap for updates and things like that for people to look forward to it?

1296
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,000
I mean, we certainly did have one six months ago.

1297
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:30,000
But now that we're sort of getting to release it's like, oh my God, like, you know, look at it.

1298
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,000
So, I mean, look, I don't think it'll be any less than six months.

1299
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:37,000
And I think it could easily end up being more.

1300
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I certainly don't want to look twenty twenty five.

1301
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I think really want to to be fully released in twenty twenty five.

1302
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:48,000
I don't really want to be spending more than a year.

1303
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,000
That would be that would be pretty crazy.

1304
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:53,000
But I mean, honestly, like we have to get all the content finished and all that sort of stuff.

1305
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
You know, we always feel like we underestimate these things.

1306
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
And of course, we have to learn what we need to learn.

1307
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:00,000
We have to get the game to the point when it is really fun.

1308
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:06,000
You know, we have to we have to make sure that like all of the things that, you know, we've got the difficulty right for the players, the economy right, like all the stuff.

1309
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:09,000
I mean, there's a lot of things that we're going to sort out.

1310
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:17,000
So I kind of have a feeling that the first few weeks at least are going to just be a scramble of like, you know, oh crap, someone like this crazy thing.

1311
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:24,000
And we found this thing like, you know, the that's always scary, you know, because it's just when we had content to P.O.E.

1312
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:29,000
one, it's like at least the kind of base of stuff that we have is kind of, you know, well tested and people know kind of what's going on with it.

1313
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
But here it's just complete new world.

1314
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:38,000
And we're the kind of game that has a lot of ability for players to do stuff that we wouldn't anticipate.

1315
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:43,000
You know, we have the just the way support teams work and everything like that.

1316
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:50,000
So I just there's certainly a lot of worry that like there's just going to be builds that like completely ridiculous that we just never anticipated.

1317
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Combining certain things in different ways, we don't expect, you know, with hundreds of support teams that can be like that.

1318
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:56,000
So, you know, that's going to be an interesting one.

1319
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
It will happen. Yeah, it is inevitable.

1320
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:59,000
It is inevitable. Right.

1321
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Like there's nothing we can even do about it because you you need hundreds and thousands of hours of testing to be able to do that with what can only be done with hundreds of thousands of players.

1322
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:14,000
And but that's also the magic of it all, which is awesome.

1323
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:19,000
That's why I was asking you like, are you literally really doing 12 classes and 36 sentences like actually?

1324
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Yeah, absolutely. We have.

1325
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
We have. We have. We know what we want to do.

1326
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:24,000
It's a bit unhinged.

1327
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:28,000
It is a bit, but, you know, we like a challenge.

1328
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:37,000
I mean, you know, the studio that produces a passive skill tree like we do clearly has a bit of a glutton for punishment for the card to just like mix it in.

1329
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:41,000
You totally put on six and then like, oh no, added more later in an expansion.

1330
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Yeah, I mean, maybe we could.

1331
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
I mean, look, this is the plan.

1332
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:45,000
This is the plan.

1333
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:51,000
You know, I mean, like as you go through, as people go through early access, it's going to feel like it's just expansion content coming up pretty frequently.

1334
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:56,000
I'm just because, you know, we have all the stuff that kind of got some of the way a lot of the way through.

1335
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:00,000
So yeah, there's the stuff that I'm pretty sure like I really want to get the druid out like we announced it.

1336
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
We've talked about it. It's a lot of fun.

1337
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
You know, I'm keen to get that out there as soon as we can.

1338
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:12,000
You know, the huntress we've talked to a bunch about as well is like those kinds of things I think will be, you know, we able to move towards those pretty quick.

1339
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
But, you know, there's obviously more to do.

1340
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:28,000
The other thing you mentioned talking roadmap like things is we've always been, you know, it's hard to predict because a lot of what will happen is and what we leave space for is reacting to what the players want.

1341
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:35,000
And so if you plan everything for so long, you're going to have very, very, very slow reaction times to fixing, you know, or adding certain content with them.

1342
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:40,000
You know, maybe the issue is I are the campaign needs more of this or this class needs more of this or something.

1343
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:46,000
So if you're planning, then you're going to be delivering on what they want solved like a year down the line or even longer.

1344
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:53,000
And where we like to remain very, very dynamic and like, you know, you want to be able to fix that stuff like, oh, well, this is the main problem.

1345
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:57,000
Like, sure, obviously, you need more than a week sometimes, most of the time.

1346
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:05,000
But we want it generally to be that the next releases, expansions, updates, whatever can alleviate as many of those problems as possible.

1347
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:17,000
So, yeah, you try not to get too strict with the planning is generally been our philosophy because especially when it comes to actually having the light service product out, because that is very, very important.

1348
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Otherwise, you're you're never going to seem like you're doing what people want.

1349
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
And what are you doing if not that?

1350
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
So that actually is good point.

1351
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,000
I was going to ask, what do you folks, what does the team want out of the beta?

1352
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Because obviously it's like a good way to market the game, but it's also, you know, key to shaping the game in the future.

1353
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Like the actual beta, it's not just early access.

1354
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:47,000
I think one of the most important things, I think it's going to be really good for the development team to get back into a live mindset and like get it back into the idea of like everything we make is shipping.

1355
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,000
People are seeing this.

1356
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Like, you know, like actually getting back to that and like, yeah, like being able to sort of see directly like, OK, we make something that goes in the game.

1357
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:56,000
People like it, don't like it, like that kind of stuff.

1358
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Like that really like that has been our studio for like most of its lifetime.

1359
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Obviously, we know before we released P1, it wasn't.

1360
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:09,000
But after that point, I mean, we are a company like we are a company that likes to think that we can do live service better than anyone else.

1361
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Like that is our goal.

1362
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:21,000
And so like getting back into that again, you know, for the entire for everyone in the studio, so everyone's working on things that are going to be releasing within, you know, certainly in less time than, you know, than three months away.

1363
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Is it going to be really, really good for us again?

1364
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:31,000
I look forward to just being able to do that because these these long term, like really long term things like that span over years.

1365
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:37,000
So you go so long without proper feedback, like stuff kind of gets made and then like, you know, it's not really in a real game.

1366
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:41,000
And so it doesn't probably lose perspective and you absolutely lose perspective on the stuff.

1367
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:44,000
So I think that that's just going to be a really great to get back to that again.

1368
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Honestly, as you said, it is early access.

1369
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000
It is a beta period.

1370
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:56,000
And I'd say, you know, personally speaking, the thing that and we mentioned it briefly about the character balance and the builds that are broken and all that.

1371
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,000
That's obviously pretty useful to me.

1372
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Right.

1373
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Plus, we have other systems in there like, you know, the checkpointing system, right.

1374
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,000
You have to kill the boss in one life.

1375
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
You know, these are things we haven't mass tested.

1376
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
And obviously other games have and they work and that's awesome.

1377
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:18,000
There are other things like, you know, the end game system is a little bit less forgiving and that if you die, you fail the map.

1378
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Right.

1379
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:25,000
These things are things that we obviously need to test and iterate on in the future by adjusting the difficulty and stuff like that.

1380
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:31,000
And you especially as you get towards this point of, you know, the end game.

1381
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Okay. Act one has been tested like crazy.

1382
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Yeah. Right.

1383
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:38,000
And you get less and less testing as it goes on because you get less people.

1384
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
They've just been around for less time.

1385
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:48,000
And so, yeah, it's going to be a huge amount of iteration and feedback and from the players and us just, you know, reevaluating all the stuff.

1386
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:51,000
And the thing is, we're always dynamic about that stuff.

1387
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Like, we'll just change things if it's wrong, we'll redesign it, we'll come up with a new way.

1388
02:45:55,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Jonathan's a firm believer of if A doesn't work and B doesn't work, then we'll find C, we'll find option C, we'll find option D and we'll keep changing things and we'll make it work.

1389
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:12,000
So, yeah, it's going to be a lot of that iteration on our design decisions, how forgiving, because like the game is pretty hard.

1390
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:13,000
You know, it can be pretty hard.

1391
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:21,000
And so when you're on that fine line of like, you know, things are difficult, you know, it's not too easy to know if you've tilted one way or the other.

1392
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:29,000
So, you know, finding what everyone agrees should be the common corrective difficulty is something that I will obviously be paying very, very, very close attention to.

1393
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:32,000
It's a pretty hard thing to nail down when you are making the game.

1394
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:44,000
And so you've we've seen that a lot where you folks have been pretty willing to change and then re-change and re-change again some of the core features like flasks and the waypointing system and portals.

1395
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
And you're keeping that kind of mindset going into the beta then.

1396
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Of course. I mean, look, we're always willing to change stuff.

1397
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Like that flask thing, like the most recent change to that was like ultra recent.

1398
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Yeah.

1399
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Like, I don't have we even had like a closed beta of that yet?

1400
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:57,000
No.

1401
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,000
I think we haven't yet.

1402
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
But I mean, I think it's way better than it was.

1403
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Like it's the things things have improved a lot.

1404
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:06,000
And honestly, like that's one of those things we've been wanting to do something to sort out flasks for ages.

1405
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Yeah.

1406
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:19,000
And it really came about because when actually looking at what new players were having trouble with when they were playing flask piano was actually like even from the very beginning of the game actually ended up being one of those things that like people just had problems.

1407
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Just the manual dexterity required to like hit all your different flask keys and then like know like you have to know when one of your flasks run out.

1408
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
So you can move to the next one and like various things like that.

1409
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Like all that stuff actually was like just a weirdly large amount of mechanical complexity right from the very beginning.

1410
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:40,000
And then even at end game, I don't think it was really that satisfying either because you ended up with like, you know, just like having to press all these buttons all the time.

1411
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:43,000
And obviously, it's all utility flasks that people are using at end game.

1412
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:49,000
And then we kind of tried to band-aid this in Peewee 1 with the, you know, some of the flask automation stuff that was out there.

1413
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:55,000
But there was still this idea that you're still more powerful if you don't automate.

1414
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:59,000
So therefore, you know, like it's like, you know, there's that trade off there.

1415
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:02,000
So you're just more powerful if you get mage blood.

1416
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Sure, sure.

1417
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:06,000
I mean, it's all automated and you're very powerful.

1418
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:13,000
But, you know, so the point is effectively that the charm stuff that we're doing effectively means that you no longer the game is making that decision of like, you know, that stuff will be automated.

1419
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:18,000
You no longer have to do that like crazy flask piano to get the best, you know, the best every character.

1420
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
And I think that is definitely a step in the right direction.

1421
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:32,000
And the other thing as well as it actually makes the crafting more meaningful, I think, on the flasks, because when you've got like five slots, then like the individual mods and the individual stuff like seems to tend to not matter as much.

1422
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
I mean, obviously, you know, people want instant recovery and things like that.

1423
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:46,000
But, you know, like the but like now it's like the actual it's much more meaningful, like on your life flask, the choice between do I want instant or do I want way more like life like that kind of stuff actually can be a lot more meaningful once you've only got one.

1424
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:49,000
So, yeah, I think I think it is a lot better personally.

1425
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:53,000
You have we'll jump ahead to floss since we're on the topic.

1426
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:58,000
You have locked in effectively the fact that there's a amount of floss there now.

1427
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
So there's always going to be a amount of floss.

1428
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:04,000
And how does that how does that tie into your design for manner?

1429
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:08,000
And are we always going to be using a lot or if we solve another way?

1430
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:09,000
What does it do?

1431
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:13,000
You can absolutely solve another way and then you'll just have a flat slot that isn't doing anything for sure.

1432
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:17,000
But I think kind of has to work that way because we really don't want.

1433
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Yeah, but like once you sort of start getting to changing that around, I feel like the system sort of starts to break with regard to like, you know, the feeling of like I know where manner is I know my health is like that kind of stuff.

1434
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:31,000
That being said, you know, we've always got uniques and stuff like that.

1435
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:32,000
I believe there's already.

1436
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Yeah, there is a unique that allows you to equip to floss.

1437
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
But the thing is then that's a build choice that you're making.

1438
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
So it's a little bit different and that's fine.

1439
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:43,000
But, you know, I think the system as it works now just a lot easier.

1440
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:48,000
So it does sound like on the manner side of things then that there are going to be multiple angles of solving manner.

1441
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Of course, of course.

1442
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:52,000
We've got leech edition number four hundred and seventy five.

1443
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:56,000
It works and we finally got it right this time.

1444
02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:00,000
You know, the idea I think it works.

1445
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:01,000
I think it's good.

1446
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:04,000
So I think that leech will be more common.

1447
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
I'm going to have to like crack out the leech diagram.

1448
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

1449
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Buckets and things like I was saying, I think I think that leech might be no, I think I was going to say leech is one of the topics in the studio that has wasted the most design of time of anything in the industry.

1450
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,000
But I actually don't think it's that.

1451
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:23,000
I think the actual worst offender is what stats should decks give you?

1452
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:28,000
I think that that is like that one has wasted so there's so many arguments about that.

1453
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I feel like that one's never come to the fore.

1454
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Like we know about each one.

1455
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:35,000
But no one is happy about giving accuracy, but no one has a better idea than what accuracy that it can give.

1456
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
And everyone's going to come up with like and chat a bit.

1457
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:40,000
I bet they'll be like saying, oh, you know, I can give this or this whatever.

1458
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:45,000
But there's like, yes, seriously, there's been endless arguments about that topic.

1459
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
It's like it's outrageous.

1460
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Yeah.

1461
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Yeah.

1462
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Hmm.

1463
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,000
You've got me thinking about it now.

1464
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Yeah.

1465
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:55,000
I mean, speed would be good, but then it's probably too much.

1466
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
Something like decks.

1467
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:58,000
You should start deck stacking.

1468
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:01,000
We can get all the designers down here right now.

1469
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:02,000
I know.

1470
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:03,000
We'll just have it out again.

1471
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:04,000
We'll just have it out again.

1472
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
The longest Q&A of all time.

1473
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
It's already going to be that.

1474
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Sometimes you're just like, we start the day, you're like, here are the problems we need to solve.

1475
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:16,000
And then you're like, what about accuracy on decks comes up again.

1476
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:19,000
It's 3 p.m. and we're still discussing dexterity.

1477
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Yeah.

1478
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
So I go home, just make it accuracy.

1479
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Exactly.

1480
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Exactly.

1481
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:27,000
That is literally how it comes back to accuracy every time.

1482
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
This is okay.

1483
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Yeah.

1484
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Rewinding a little bit.

1485
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:35,000
We can't forget our roots with Path of Exile 1, of course.

1486
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:40,000
So for the POE1 enjoyers, what is the plan for POE1 during the course of this beta?

1487
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Is there going to be leagues launching?

1488
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Is it on the back burner?

1489
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Yeah.

1490
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:45,000
There absolutely will be leagues launching.

1491
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Now, I don't know the exact date, but the plan is kind of late February.

1492
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
But I mean, look, we'll see what happens.

1493
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:56,000
I will admit that unfortunately we did have to steal a few POE1 resources just towards the end here,

1494
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
which has kind of been a bit unfortunate.

1495
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
I really wish we didn't have to.

1496
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
But yeah, as I said, we kind of underestimated some of the stuff.

1497
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:09,000
But everyone is going to be going back to POE1 again for the February League.

1498
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
And we're going to make sure that we can do that.

1499
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:16,000
One of the things that was a big problem for our studio when we had a long term project and a short term project

1500
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:21,000
is that you've always had that thing of like you always want to work on the short term thing.

1501
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:26,000
So now that we've got two short term things coming up, actually it's going to be a bit easier to prioritize in some respects.

1502
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Because it's like all that stuff is then coming up soon.

1503
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:34,000
But we'll see. We'll see how it goes.

1504
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:37,000
But yeah, we need to get that POE1 expansion out next.

1505
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Obviously, I just want to always make it clear that the reason why things can't be so planned out is again, we're just releasing this game.

1506
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Obviously, we pivoted to end game and then that needed more resources.

1507
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:56,000
And then of course, combined with the fact that things obviously change.

1508
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:00,000
There are unpredictable things in the environment we can't necessarily guarantee.

1509
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:07,000
And then of course, you have Christmas coming up and all of that.

1510
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
There's so many variables to consider.

1511
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:16,000
But we also don't know how much time is going to be invested necessarily or need to be invested into live operations for post release.

1512
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
How many problems are going to go wrong?

1513
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:21,000
How many builds are there? How many of the uniques are broken?

1514
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
And where do all these resources go?

1515
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:26,000
There are like just millions of variables here to consider.

1516
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:30,000
And so it can get very, very difficult, especially after this time.

1517
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:39,000
But once you release, you have a grace period, so to speak, where we're more like a period of extreme amounts of fire, where we're putting out fires everywhere.

1518
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:47,000
We have a period where we're fixing everything, you get everything stable, and then we're going to be like, all right, let's recalibrate, figure everything out.

1519
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:55,000
And what is our plans? And then establish all of that based also on the feedback we get from that period where everything's on fire.

1520
02:53:55,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Not to make it sound like it's going to be bad, but that is the inevitability is that there's always problems.

1521
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:06,000
Hopefully it appears good from a player perspective, but there's always going to be like, oh my God, people found us.

1522
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
We don't have to see all the fires.

1523
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:14,000
Ideally, the best thing is when we're able to fix some kind of exploit before people even hear about it.

1524
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
And when I say exploit, I'm just talking about some broken thing.

1525
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:26,000
We obviously normally have to worry about the whole mid-league nerf concept, but it's like if you can deal with something within an hour or two of it happening,

1526
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:33,000
then it's like you're kind of OK because no one had a chance to swap their build over to it or whatever.

1527
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:37,000
But we're going to have to be really on the ball for POE 2 just because there's so many things that are new.

1528
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Wow. I mean, look, we have several bosses with several elevators.

1529
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
How many of them can be pushed up the elevator?

1530
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:46,000
You know what I mean?

1531
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:50,000
When I say a fire, I'm talking about bosses getting pushed up elevators.

1532
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,000
That's not OK.

1533
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:55,000
I am liking my mercenary flashbang knockback is very fun.

1534
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
Yeah, you need to look into that, by the way.

1535
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
I feel like you're going to nerf my build.

1536
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Stay away from my grenade.

1537
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:03,000
He's finding fires already.

1538
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:06,000
These are the fun things.

1539
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Discovering that stuff can be very fun for the players.

1540
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
It's just internally, it's like, oh no, what are we doing?

1541
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:15,000
It can get a little bit panicky after release, you know, and there's lots of things going on.

1542
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
You're like, oh, geez, what do I sell first?

1543
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:20,000
But obviously, you know, it's the same as POE 1.

1544
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
We're good at it at this point.

1545
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:30,000
You are going to be torturing us with like releasing beta stuff at the same time as POE 1 league launches.

1546
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Yeah, the plan is to keep them separated a bit from each other so that you get a chance to play.

1547
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Don't make me choose.

1548
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,000
Don't make me choose.

1549
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:42,000
So we saw a cinematic, to put it lightly.

1550
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
It was pretty, that was quite epic.

1551
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
And I know has been cooking for quite some time.

1552
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
And that was pretty exciting.

1553
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:55,000
But we've also seen just a lot of story stuff happening in a much higher level than previously now.

1554
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
So you're stepping up your storytelling game here a bit.

1555
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Yeah, so we really wanted to make sure that the storytelling in POE 2 is much better than what it was in POE 1.

1556
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Like, you know, there's a lot more kind of, I guess, like that kind of like stuff with the introductions to boss fights and the outros and things like that.

1557
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Like all that stuff, we've just got a lot more storytelling going in.

1558
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
All of those things.

1559
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:16,000
We do have the intro cut scene.

1560
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:24,000
There's also can kind of like light, like between the acts, these kind of like more kind of motion graphic type cut scenes just kind of establish things.

1561
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
And there might be some more surprises later on in the game as well.

1562
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Not in early access, unfortunately.

1563
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Later on that we can see as well.

1564
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:37,000
But ultimately, we just want to make sure that like I think a lot of people who got through the POE 1 story had no idea what was happening by the end.

1565
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:43,000
And so effectively want to make sure that is not the case this time around, that people really are able to absorb things.

1566
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:55,000
But one thing I will say, though, is that it's ultra important to us that we don't break the feeling that like when you're playing a second time that it like that it feels like we don't want to feel annoying the second time.

1567
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:56,000
We were talking about this this morning.

1568
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

1569
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Don't take the control out of the players hands.

1570
02:56:58,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Exactly.

1571
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:08,000
So yeah, I'm a personally a believer of the fact that if you just change when you change the camera position for a cut scene, immediately it feels way more annoying.

1572
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Like, because this just hold this whole thing like like if you click on an NBC and like the camera changes position, like, sure, when you're playing through the campaign the first time, that kind of thing is like, you know, like that can be cool.

1573
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:30,000
But then the if you're like you're playing through the second, third, fourth, fifth time, you want to try to go to the NBC and click, click, click, click and just get past without feeling like you've had to sort of worry about anything.

1574
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:38,000
So yeah, like effectively we want to make sure that it's still that we still have that, you know, because ultimately, you know, we're a game you expect people to play through many times.

1575
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:59,000
So ideally we can kind of deliver both the situation where the first time you play through it, it feels like an amazing story that you're getting that you're taking seriously that you're understanding that you know there's like all those sort of touch points and, you know, little, little, you know, things just all through while also maintaining the fact that if you know what you're doing, it's like you don't have to go talk to some quest giver just to get a quest like you could just go do the thing, you know, without having to talk to someone about it first.

1576
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:05,000
So, you know, that kind of stuff is really important just to make the, you know, that that stuff work well when you when you know what you're doing.

1577
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:10,000
You said something this morning that stuck with me where you said like Path of Exile is a game where the player's meta knowledge is allowed and encouraged.

1578
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Absolutely. Absolutely. So you're allowed to cheat this quest.

1579
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Effectively, yes. Effectively, there's what the character knows and there's what the player knows and in our game what the player knows is needs to be sufficient as far as like being able to progress the storyline.

1580
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:26,000
If you can, you're not, you don't want to have it so you just talk to NBC just to find out something you already knew as a player.

1581
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:31,000
Yeah, like if you know you kill this boss, you get the next area's waypoint. So you just like kill it log in.

1582
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:34,000
I love doing that. Meta knowledge.

1583
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:52,000
So you explained to me the other day the kind of the context for the beast and how that leads into the cutscene in the beginning of POE 2 from POE 1 and that I think helped put it in a lot more perspective for me and made me appreciate and understand what's going on in the story.

1584
02:58:52,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Yeah, so effectively what you're seeing in the opening cutscene is effectively a new seed of a beast that is going to be growing.

1585
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:13,000
Now in POE 1, the beast was killed and then what happened in response to that is a bunch of all the gods in the world were able to effectively rise again.

1586
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:28,000
And you killed a bunch of them, but there are more in the world and effectively, we don't want to spoil too much about the storyline overall, but effectively obviously someone here, the Count is wanting to harness the power of the beast once again.

1587
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:35,000
And then we have the mysterious figure there who is saying, no, don't do this. This always turns out badly.

1588
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:40,000
There was a comment in chat that I loved that was like, stop opening Eldritch boxes.

1589
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:43,000
Exactly.

1590
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Why do people keep doing this?

1591
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:47,000
Yeah, I would.

1592
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:51,000
If someone handed you a mysterious orb, wouldn't you press the button?

1593
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:57,000
I mean, exactly.

1594
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:01,000
I mean, I'm going to try, but who knows how many hours it's going to take me.

1595
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Indeed.

1596
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:13,000
So we had a fun moment earlier where you were watching it and you were like, oh, we really need to need to rename that passive because he's a Karui and it's a wolf.

1597
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
It's called Great Wolf's Howl.

1598
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:16,000
Great Wolf's Howl.

1599
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
So he went up to Isomite history.

1600
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:19,000
I started telling him.

1601
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
I stomped out of the room.

1602
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:24,000
I was like, we need to rename that notable. He's Karui.

1603
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:34,000
And then I was kindly reminded that actually he was an orphan and was adopted by Isomite and raised.

1604
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:39,000
And so, yes, there is a mixture of Karui and Isomite background.

1605
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:40,000
And I was like, it works.

1606
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:41,000
You're wrong.

1607
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Fair enough. I walked back in here all sad and whatever.

1608
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:45,000
My bad.

1609
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:46,000
It's fine.

1610
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:47,000
The name is good.

1611
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:48,000
He looked so chastised when he came back in.

1612
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:53,000
But that just like points to the fact that I feel like you're doing a lot more with the characters here.

1613
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:57,000
You even mentioned that ascendancy stuff is going to have an impact story wise.

1614
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:58,000
That's wild.

1615
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
We just think a lot about this kind of stuff.

1616
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:04,000
So the acolyte of, I always get this name wrong, the acolyte of, is it Chayula?

1617
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Chayula.

1618
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Chayula. I always say this wrong.

1619
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:09,000
So the acolyte of Chayula, for example.

1620
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:16,000
So we have this sort of storyline with the origins of the monks where there's like an order of monks who worship a thing they call the dreamer.

1621
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:19,000
And the dreamer is actually Chayula.

1622
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
So they don't know this.

1623
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
They're worshiping a breach demon.

1624
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:27,000
So the acolyte of Chayula is effectively you embracing the fact that I'm worshiping a breach demon.

1625
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,000
I'm just going to go all the way.

1626
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
I'm in too deep now.

1627
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Exactly.

1628
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
We're just going to do it.

1629
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:35,000
So yeah, there's a lot of thinking like that that goes into these things.

1630
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
What is the history of these people?

1631
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:40,000
Because I think a lot of that stuff inspires interesting mechanics as well.

1632
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:45,000
So for example, on that one, you've got that into the breach skill, which kind of means you're always in a breach all the time.

1633
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
You can see the like things going on.

1634
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:50,000
That stuff is I think there's a lot of cool inspiration there.

1635
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:58,000
So coming up with that storyline stuff for that stuff, I think just a couple of the little things that I think is cool as well.

1636
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
And hopefully people will notice and pay attention to.

1637
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:07,000
So there's one of the bosses that was shown as uses a lot of time or chronomancy.

1638
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:21,000
And interestingly, if you are a sorceress and you ascend to chronomancer and you then go to fight that boss, if you, for example, try to use time freeze, the boss is like, yeah, that doesn't work on me.

1639
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
And there's a dialogue line.

1640
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:28,000
And if you cast temporal chains on them, he's like, you know, just puts it back on you.

1641
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:29,000
And it's like, yeah.

1642
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:30,000
And so there's interesting things like that.

1643
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:33,000
And it doesn't like change things on a grand scale, right?

1644
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:36,000
It doesn't make a certain class not viable or anything like that.

1645
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:39,000
But there's this interesting little quirks and quips everywhere.

1646
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:43,000
Different bosses have different intro lines, depending on what class you're playing.

1647
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:47,000
They have different skill lines sometimes, depending on what class you're playing.

1648
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:53,000
Yeah, we've got different dialogue all through the campaign for different classes like the sorceress was obviously from the Marraketh.

1649
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:57,000
When she goes back to the Marraketh, there's kind of a little backstory there about how she was banished originally.

1650
03:02:57,000 --> 03:03:01,000
So, you know, she needs to find a way to be, she needs to be accepted back into the culture again.

1651
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:05,000
You know, like we've got things like, you know, the character we talked about earlier.

1652
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
So the warrior, you know, was an orphan.

1653
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:11,000
You know, he he was brought up by actually one of the NPCs in Act One Town.

1654
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:14,000
So obviously there's a whole different dialogue there because he's effectively has adopted son.

1655
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
You know, we've got things like that.

1656
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:25,000
There's a lot of thought that's gone into, you know, trying to make it feel like all these character classes have some level of involvement with the world, you know, that didn't just come into existence the moment that you.

1657
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
There's other little things.

1658
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:30,000
So like more on the narrative side of you, obviously, we saw the world map.

1659
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:34,000
You have the icons that show different things that are in each act, like all the things you want to explore.

1660
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
So find and yeah, awesome.

1661
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:41,000
But each of them also has a little bit of a kind of little bit of text on them as well.

1662
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:50,000
And like, for example, the there's one in one of the first areas in the game that's just like a camp of iron count guards.

1663
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:59,000
And, you know, we showed it in a trailer when the when the Ranger class trailer we did, you know, whenever it was, you saw the Ranger shoot some of the kill some of the people.

1664
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:08,000
They were trying to like hurt a child, you know, and the child was just trying to get some food and the Ranger just like snipes them with arrows and kills them ruthlessly.

1665
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:17,000
And so you read this thing and you're like, you know, you hear whispers of an iron count, you know, scouting party that was slain by a rogue archer or something like that.

1666
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:23,000
So you get these little things where we like connecting a lot of little dots and even that you absorb a little bit of interesting little information.

1667
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:33,000
You've got other things, for example, when you enter an area, it not only says the name at the top now, it has almost a subtitle text that's giving you a little bit a little bit of history.

1668
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:37,000
These little things like somehow make the world building feel so much better.

1669
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:52,000
And when you approach certain landmark rooms and you walk into them, you'll get a banner at the top as well, which says what it is and gives again a little bit of a thing and all these little micro narrative delivery mechanisms like make you feel way more immersed in the world and way more aware of what's going on.

1670
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:56,000
And way more connected to your character, way more connected to the bosses, to the NPCs.

1671
03:04:57,000 --> 03:05:01,000
It's yeah, there's a lot we're doing now that we certainly never did before.

1672
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
We didn't even think of before.

1673
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Yeah, it's it's I like that a lot because like as an action RPG gamer, I don't really care too much about plot, but I do want a really cool world to be blowing monsters up in basically.

1674
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:24,000
That's like I want characters to be cool, I want the baddies to be cool and I want like the things happening around me that like in, you know, build out a bit of that story without me having to stop killing stuff.

1675
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:25,000
Yeah.

1676
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
And it sounds like there's more of that going on as well.

1677
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:28,000
Which is great.

1678
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:29,000
The baddies being cool.

1679
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:36,000
I mean, that's how we almost designed an ascendancy class in here just before when we were watching that trailer earlier.

1680
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:41,000
So what you were saying a shadow, you came up with a shadow ascendancy.

1681
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

1682
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Well, internally, we had some developers watching the trailer yesterday getting excited about it.

1683
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
And then I was like, I want to play that.

1684
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
I want to play that character.

1685
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:52,000
I want to be that character.

1686
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:53,000
That's awesome.

1687
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:56,000
That like kind of Vaal, Thormiturge type character.

1688
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:57,000
And so like, cool.

1689
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:00,000
All of a sudden, it's like, we should make that a class.

1690
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
And then we had another guy like suggest it should be a shadow.

1691
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:05,000
And so now I'm like, oh, yeah, we're definitely come on.

1692
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:08,000
We have to do a Vaal, Thormiturge shadow ascendancy.

1693
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,000
Like, that's gonna be cool.

1694
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:12,000
You can do awesome things now even.

1695
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:24,000
I know it's hard to say because you hide it under all the armor, but you can do things like, you know, with our character classes, just due to the upgrades and models where all of a sudden now the character can have tattoos added to them and stuff like that is completely feasible in the future.

1696
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:27,000
And like, I would I want to do a lot more of that stuff.

1697
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:33,000
And stuff like for the there's little things that for the Warbringer, I think was the class name on the warrior.

1698
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:41,000
When you take that ancestral totem node, all your totems now have like an extra blue glow to them kind of like they're enhanced by this ancestral magic.

1699
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:47,000
And what we also want to do is has add tattoos as well that like glow blue when you're using certain skills and all that.

1700
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:57,000
So heaps of little things that again connects all the culture and all that stuff together and make you feel like, you know, it's believable as opposed and this is a character as opposed to this is just a mechanic and you know.

1701
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
Makes picking an ascendancy more epic.

1702
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:07,000
I know that there was a part in the trailer that was like not fully finished where you ascend and it doesn't really do anything, but I know you want it to be like a cool moment where some power goes in here.

1703
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Yeah, absolutely. We just hadn't finished the VFX yet.

1704
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Even the another one, the blood mage. When you like, you know, play the blood mage and now you can edit of surge on your character whenever you cast spells, you're getting like almost blood bending kind of vibe going on and like drawing it from their veins and sending a fireball.

1705
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
It's cool. Yeah.

1706
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:29,000
Yeah, you can have like the tattoos get tattooed on them as they as they ascend and things like that.

1707
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:41,000
I mean, that just makes taking a sentence a way more cool, which is already I think I almost feel like a sentence is more important than the classes for players kind of like feeling the vibe of what they want to do with their character for sure.

1708
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:46,000
Because I mean, the classes are pretty open. You can play whatever skills whatever weapon show you're on a passive tree at a start point.

1709
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:54,000
But you know, by high level, you kind of go wherever you want to go using jewels, especially getting off class stuff. You can kind of be whatever you want with the base class.

1710
03:07:54,000 --> 03:08:06,000
So eventually, yeah, the ascendancy is what becomes more of that important identifying feature, because that's what you have actually chosen that makes you distinct that another different class wouldn't be able to actually have.

1711
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:09,000
So yeah, yeah. So you want to make that super, super cool.

1712
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:16,000
And on that note, I was definitely confused. I know people are definitely confused and a little worried about ascendancy and what's happening with that.

1713
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:23,000
And people were like watching the like the second trial and being like, oh, what if I don't like this?

1714
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:29,000
Oh, it's just another lab again. But I want you to like lay it out as like simply as possible.

1715
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
Like how do you ascend? Yeah.

1716
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:35,000
Yeah. So effectively, in the full game, there's going to be three ascendancy trials for early access.

1717
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:40,000
There's two. And effectively, you can use any of those ascendancy trials to be able to do your ascension.

1718
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
You choose. You choose which one.

1719
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:49,000
And effectively, if you as you get to high level, like high level keys for those trials, that will unlock more points.

1720
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:53,000
Like if you do it at certain level break points, that will allow you to get more points for those classes.

1721
03:08:53,000 --> 03:09:01,000
So if you want to just play the entire just just only the trial of the chaos god with, you know, to get all your points, then you can just decide to do that.

1722
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
Just play at a higher and higher levels and get more points as you go through.

1723
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:06,000
You know, if you want to do a mix, that's fine, too.

1724
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
Personally, I think people want to try out all the different content.

1725
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:13,000
I mean, you might think that you but even within the trials, there's there's choices, right?

1726
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:16,000
Like I know that there's always contention around traps.

1727
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:22,000
But because in the trial, the second is you can choose which rooms you want to go to.

1728
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:25,000
If you don't want to deal with traps, you just don't pick those rooms, right?

1729
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:28,000
Like you don't go to the rooms, you can just go to other things.

1730
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:29,000
The combat ones.

1731
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:33,000
And that's fine, too. So effectively, it's like you always get to choose what you're doing there.

1732
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:37,000
Like it's funny because I know traps are so contentious, but also there are other people who just enjoy that stuff.

1733
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:40,000
So, you know, you want to have something for all those people to.

1734
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:43,000
There's a path of exile, divisive content, but lots of choice.

1735
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
And you can choose what to do and what not to do.

1736
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
And then we're embracing that here now.

1737
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
And that's clearly leaning into that now.

1738
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:53,000
You have you have I mean, such a competitive advantage in that you have so much content.

1739
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
And even with P2, that's still going to be the case.

1740
03:09:55,000 --> 03:10:00,000
So you can lean into that, like making content that is spicier but divisive.

1741
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:07,000
And now you're like separating trees and having these things be a little able to be focused on a lot more.

1742
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:10,000
And you're doing that with the trials with your sentences.

1743
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:14,000
And you can like you can kind of do all of them and drip feed yourself smaller.

1744
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:20,000
And there's also stuff that you're going to be getting from those like specific rewards and everything that might incentivize you to do that.

1745
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:24,000
But of course, on the other hand, if you don't want to do that content, we have open, full open trade, right?

1746
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:27,000
You can just trade for the rewards and that's fine, too.

1747
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:29,000
So, you know, like that's always part of it.

1748
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:33,000
Yes, like the rewards there, for example, like jewels drop throughout the world.

1749
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:37,000
But if you want to get more jewels, you go and run sanctum.

1750
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Now, if you want to get the radius jewels, you do sanctum.

1751
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:41,000
I can't.

1752
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
Trial of the second.

1753
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:49,000
So for anyone who isn't a Path of Exile 1 player, this is effectively a sequel to Sanctum League that we did in Path of Exile 1.

1754
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
So it's mechanically very similar.

1755
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:56,000
But it's obviously, you know, America, you know, like America trial now.

1756
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:59,000
And, you know, we've changed a lot of things about it have changed and like the content is new.

1757
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:05,000
But it is effectively the same overall mechanic, you know, in terms of that sort of rogue like mechanic that we have.

1758
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:09,000
The same with the other one. You have Ultimatum in POE 1 being the theme.

1759
03:11:09,000 --> 03:11:14,000
And of course, now it's redesigned and it's evolved into Trial of Chaos.

1760
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:17,000
So, yeah, a lot of people in chat would have been spamming Ultimatum.

1761
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:21,000
And for those who haven't played, would probably be like, I don't understand.

1762
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:26,000
Effectively, the Trial of Chaos is a sequel to Ultimatum, which is...

1763
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:31,000
And we just have to get used to the new names, which is very hard.

1764
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:34,000
But yeah, anyway, the point being, of course, in Vaal Orbs drop in the world as well.

1765
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:41,000
And if you want a larger dose of Vaal Orbs and you know, you don't want to trade, go feel free to run some Ultimatums.

1766
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Thing is, because they're all item generated keys as well, it's not like you have to do it right then and there.

1767
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:52,000
You can trade the keys away. At any point, you can also buy more keys if you want to farm more of that thing.

1768
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:56,000
And if you just want to do it later, just stockpile a bunch of them, run them all at your leisure.

1769
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:59,000
You know what I mean? It's like you have the freedom.

1770
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:04,000
So I don't know if they are itemized, tradable, as is a lot in Path of Exile tradition, but...

1771
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:08,000
Well, as is everything, right? The only thing you can't trade is gold.

1772
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:13,000
So we're like the exact opposite of most games, where it's like the gold is freely tradable and the items get locked.

1773
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:17,000
We're like the gold is the only thing you can't trade and every other item is free and open.

1774
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:23,000
Yeah, and that's because you've made gold be this way to be like, you're playing the game so you have access to this.

1775
03:12:23,000 --> 03:12:25,000
And you don't want to trade that away.

1776
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:26,000
Effectively.

1777
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:34,000
So on the ascendancies and the trials, how hard do you foresee getting your ascendancy to be while leveling?

1778
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:38,000
Do you expect people to fail out and attempt these things multiple times? And what does that look like if you do?

1779
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:41,000
Well, I failed the first time I did the trial.

1780
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:45,000
It is important to know that that first itemized key is a quest key.

1781
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:50,000
And we have special rules around it that if you do fail, you can just repeat it, right?

1782
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:54,000
You changed that recently because that was something that I didn't actually realize you'd changed.

1783
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:56,000
I guess it was a little bit too harsh to require to get another one.

1784
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:58,000
Yeah, you weren't the only one failing it.

1785
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:02,000
But yeah, so pretty much you get to reattempt it.

1786
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:11,000
And for something like Ultimatum, just to immediately start thinking of VXploit, I can just do three of the waves, then intentionally fail and then repeat them.

1787
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:14,000
Well, we've thought of that. Don't worry. You can't.

1788
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
But yeah, the first ones are repeatable.

1789
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:22,000
You're not going to be like, what the heck, now I have to just play to the whims of random generation to ascend?

1790
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:28,000
It is pretty hard, though. I definitely don't think you'll do it on your first attempt.

1791
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:33,000
I did, not to brag. I did pass on. I was clenched, though.

1792
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:35,000
Yeah, OK. Yeah, especially that boss fight.

1793
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
I was watching him do the boss fight from afar.

1794
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:39,000
You came by right as I was doing the boss fight.

1795
03:13:39,000 --> 03:13:42,000
But you had some kind of powerful boons there, to be perfectly honest.

1796
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:45,000
I got 60% move speed. That was part of my strategic choice.

1797
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:48,000
I was watching you from... How is he so fast?

1798
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:50,000
This isn't the Pee-wee 2 slide.

1799
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:53,000
I was like, what, with Dodger, I was going across half the arena?

1800
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
This game is supposed to be slow.

1801
03:13:57,000 --> 03:14:00,000
It was good fun. I quite liked it.

1802
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:06,000
I mostly like Sanctum. I don't want to do it all the time, but I did quite like the Trial of Sakama,

1803
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:09,000
knowing that there's other choices, so I can de-ultimate them instead or something like that.

1804
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:10,000
That's fun, 100%.

1805
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:15,000
So you've got these two roguelike dungeons that are going into the beta that launch, but they're done very differently.

1806
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:19,000
One's got the honor system, which is like a separate health, but it's based on and scaled by your health,

1807
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:21,000
which I noted is quite interesting.

1808
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:23,000
And your defenses now, it can be fully mitigated and everything.

1809
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:28,000
Yeah, so fully scaled by your character. You go in in a tanky character, you'll be tanky in the dungeon, which is really cool.

1810
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:33,000
And then with Ultimatum, and just because people will ask, in Ultimatum there aren't any traps.

1811
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:36,000
Yes. No traps in Ultimatum and no honor system in Ultimatum.

1812
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:40,000
If you just want more of a pure combat experience, then that's your choice.

1813
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:43,000
And then there's going to be a third one as well, which is a secret for now.

1814
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:48,000
So once Act 4 goes on, then we'll have a third trial.

1815
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:55,000
So people sort of broadly know that the Kurui are in Act 4, so it's a question of how would the Kurui ascend, is the question.

1816
03:14:55,000 --> 03:15:00,000
Yes, and if there's any other things that have been called trials associated with the Kurui at some point in the past.

1817
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:03,000
How likely that is to be related.

1818
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:07,000
I'm just thinking now, we were just thinking of the Vile Thormiturge class before, and I'm already thinking,

1819
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:10,000
Oh, it'd be so cool if you ascend in Ultimatum.

1820
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:14,000
We want the Trialmaster to say different lines to you because you're like choosing the way of the Vile.

1821
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:17,000
I can't stop thinking about all this stuff.

1822
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:21,000
I did hear a few of his lines in some of the gameplay Jontham was showing me.

1823
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:24,000
I love that he's back, the Trialmaster.

1824
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:25,000
He's cool.

1825
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:29,000
A little salty sometimes that you're taking this power, it seems.

1826
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:33,000
So we have the unique rewards from each of them.

1827
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:41,000
Like you said, the jewels are global, but there are unique jewels, and then there are unique socketables from the other one.

1828
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:46,000
And is there something planned to be unique from the final third trial that will be added later?

1829
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:48,000
Of course.

1830
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:50,000
Yes, there is already.

1831
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:52,000
I know what they are. I'm not going to say it, don't worry.

1832
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:55,000
Keep some secrets, fine then.

1833
03:15:55,000 --> 03:15:57,000
Again, I value the discovery.

1834
03:15:57,000 --> 03:16:01,000
If I accidentally say it, it is certainly by mistake.

1835
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,000
But yes, don't worry.

1836
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:11,000
That Vile Orbs from the Ultimatum in particular, they seem like they're a lot more important, a lot more powerful.

1837
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:15,000
I certainly think that some of the stuff is a lot better with how they work.

1838
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:20,000
One of the things that we wanted to change was that implicit on items are truly implicit.

1839
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,000
You can't get rid of them, they stay there.

1840
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:29,000
So that means that when you do a Vile Orb, the mod that you get there now is in addition to whatever implicit already had, which is obviously good.

1841
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:36,000
And then the next one being that you can get plus one socket above the normal limit, which is also kind of powerful.

1842
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,000
Especially with the soul cores.

1843
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:45,000
In the Trial of Chaos, you get soul cores that you can't get from anywhere else.

1844
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:52,000
And those effectively are mods that are typically a bit beyond what you would normally get on regular items.

1845
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:57,000
Whereas runes, which kind of drop everywhere, those ones are just kind of normal everyday mods that you would expect to find on any kind of item.

1846
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:58,000
Resists and things like that.

1847
03:16:58,000 --> 03:17:00,000
Yes, just resists and damage and that kind of stuff.

1848
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:06,000
So effectively the soul cores is kind of the more end-gamey socketables that you might want to be using.

1849
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:09,000
And obviously being able to get plus one socket.

1850
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:11,000
It's something that everyone will want.

1851
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:15,000
But on the other hand, there is that risk of just breaking your item.

1852
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:20,000
So that's the deadly gamble you have as your final crafting step there.

1853
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:22,000
Vile Orbs are more forgiving though.

1854
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:23,000
They are, yes.

1855
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:27,000
If you think about, we talked about enchantment.

1856
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:31,000
So some slots you might value the enchantment over a rune or a socket slot.

1857
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:34,000
And I think that's probably, especially towards end-game, I'd say that's probably going to tilt that way.

1858
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:37,000
Because maybe a soul core contests with it.

1859
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:41,000
But the whole point is that there's choice there involved.

1860
03:17:41,000 --> 03:17:45,000
So there's enchantment, we just talked about the socket.

1861
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:48,000
There's obviously always the case of doing nothing, which happens.

1862
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:56,000
But for just say regular rare items, it will reroll one to three modifiers at random.

1863
03:17:56,000 --> 03:18:00,000
Effectively do a Chaos Orb on one to three modifiers, not all six.

1864
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:07,000
And as much as that can often be a downside, because if you're using it on a very good item, obviously it's going to take away the good ones.

1865
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:11,000
But if you're using it on a mid item, you can actually turn it very good.

1866
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:19,000
I've had this happen, when I've been playing, I've got like, life, defense, defense, double res, and something else that I don't want.

1867
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:23,000
And I'm like, I'll just start vialing everything because why not?

1868
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:27,000
I've got my Vile Orbs and I vial it and it rerolls that bottom mod into a tri-res.

1869
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:31,000
And then I got a tri-res, double defense, life helmet and I was like, you're awesome.

1870
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:37,000
So even that, which can often be perceived as a bad outcome now, isn't going to completely brick your item.

1871
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:44,000
For example, if you have a weapon, you've got your three damage mods and you've got some bad suffixes, it could even be an option.

1872
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:48,000
Or hopefully it doesn't just remove all three damage mods.

1873
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:53,000
Whereas before, if it bricked it, it often was almost always a brick.

1874
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:55,000
That item is now dead.

1875
03:18:55,000 --> 03:19:00,000
Tell me about a new unique result, which I don't know if you want to spoil or not.

1876
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:03,000
100%. It's cool. It's so cool.

1877
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:07,000
I'm surprised you even got that one past Rishi, honestly.

1878
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:10,000
I mean, he got it made. We discussed it.

1879
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:15,000
I agree. I messaged it to him thinking he'll be like, no way, this is unacceptable.

1880
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:17,000
He was there for it.

1881
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:19,000
It didn't turn into a dexterity chat.

1882
03:19:19,000 --> 03:19:28,000
What it effectively does is it just takes the mod values and it goes up to, I can't remember exactly the values,

1883
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:36,000
but let's just say it changes all the values to between 0.8 and 1.2 of what they were multiplied.

1884
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:39,000
But it doesn't care about the minimum and maximums.

1885
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:46,000
So for example, if you had a thousand life calms heart, you can use this to get, again, this is me assuming it's 20% variance,

1886
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:50,000
because I can't remember what we balanced it to, but you'll be able to get a 1200 life calms heart, for example.

1887
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:54,000
Now that's obviously giving up the enchantment and a socket.

1888
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:58,000
Just think about sockets on calms heart. I can't remember what we did, but whatever.

1889
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:02,000
I think you can actually do that, which is interesting.

1890
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:07,000
But ultimately it's like, yeah, now I'm choosing, do I want the enchantment?

1891
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:13,000
Do I want an extra 100 something 200 life, whatever that ends up being?

1892
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:15,000
Or do I want the socket?

1893
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:20,000
So it's quite an interesting choice and adds an extra access of corruption to unique items that is, I think.

1894
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:22,000
Corrupted divining of uniques.

1895
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:27,000
Yeah, effectively, yeah, it's divining them, but with higher maximums and lower minimums.

1896
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:30,000
Surely there's going to be some broken things like max res or something like that.

1897
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:32,000
I mean, we'll guess we'll find out.

1898
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:35,000
Cross that bridge when it comes to it.

1899
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,000
Yeah, it's fine.

1900
03:20:37,000 --> 03:20:42,000
So that was all just talking about the trials, how you actually get your ascendancies,

1901
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,000
what about the actual ascendancies themselves?

1902
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:46,000
How are they cooking?

1903
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:50,000
Well, they're fun. They're cool.

1904
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:56,000
We certainly try to get what we've tried to do is for the class, we've tried to have one that's a bit more out there.

1905
03:20:56,000 --> 03:21:02,000
Something that isn't just, you know, like if you think even about in Pee Wee Wan, you've got the duelist.

1906
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:06,000
You can go like champion or slayer or holy words.

1907
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:09,000
I don't remember, but you know the drill.

1908
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,000
And the gladiator.

1909
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:16,000
And the problem is like, OK, they're all just about like hitting stuff with weapons and they haven't.

1910
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:19,000
There's nothing really out there. Sure, they all sound cool.

1911
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:21,000
Don't get me wrong, and they can be cool.

1912
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:25,000
And they do have differences, but there's nothing that's like kind of crazy.

1913
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:29,000
So all of a sudden now when you're like, you know, sorceress, you're using all your elemental skills.

1914
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:31,000
And now you can just like go into this thing that can stop time.

1915
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:34,000
You know, it's a little bit more crazy.

1916
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:43,000
And you've got the mercenary and you can turn into a gemling legionnaire and effectively fuse gems into your flesh to like, you know, mutate yourself.

1917
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:47,000
You know, it's like not just talking about crossbows and projectiles over and over and over and over again.

1918
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
It's like doing kind of whack stuff.

1919
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:51,000
So I really like that. That's awesome.

1920
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:56,000
And we're going to make sure every single class has one thing that is like definitely out there.

1921
03:21:56,000 --> 03:22:03,000
And then one thing that's, you know, more predictable, more to the expectation of the trope, you know, for example, the dead eye to the ranger.

1922
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:10,000
And but yeah, lots and lots of cool interactions, just cool and playing with different mechanics.

1923
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:14,000
And we've tried to make them like, for example, none of them call out a weapon, right?

1924
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:24,000
None of them. So you we're trying to make sure that they're broad enough to be that you might be a ranger going a dead eye, but playing a caster, right?

1925
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:31,000
Playing spells, like keeping all of that open, that flexibility, that kind of crazy, you know, for the Johnny players, as we call it out there,

1926
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:40,000
who want to just completely experiment and figure out, you know, the most broken weird stuff, you know, and you get things with that when you still like, OK, OK, I'm a ranger.

1927
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:46,000
And I'm using a quill rain and one weapon set specked into a bunch of prod speed attack speed.

1928
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:50,000
And in my second weapon set, I'm using a spell caster staff with a bunch of projectile stuff.

1929
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:53,000
And I'm invested into more spell damage side.

1930
03:22:53,000 --> 03:23:04,000
And you've got a whack tree and all of a sudden now you're this like dead eye archer spell caster mage hybrid doing all kinds of wacky stuff or like even or let's say the same build and experimenting with a bunch of triggers.

1931
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:16,000
And so you're using your bow as a quill rain as a higher tax speed delivery mechanism for, you know, laying down a bunch of either CCs or slows or building up crowd controls.

1932
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:21,000
And then you're using the caster stuff and like you get some pretty out there things going on.

1933
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:28,000
And the important thing is it's not like just like benefiting only arrows or only bow attacks or anything like that.

1934
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:39,000
It's broad and now, you know, opens up the world to what you can do and same like the gemling legionnaire on the mercenary is entirely just about gem slot skills, support zero.

1935
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:44,000
There's no you don't have to be anything. You can be literally whatever build you want.

1936
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:54,000
And yeah, so that that's embracing that making sure people still even though we have all these classes you are embracing that path of Excel, you can do anything fantasy that we want people to be able to do.

1937
03:23:54,000 --> 03:24:00,000
And if you don't want to go with the trope perfectly fine, you'll still be powerful.

1938
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:07,000
It sounds like you're really trying to avoid that thing that we've had a couple times in POE one where like a certain niche is relegated to on ascendancy.

1939
03:24:07,000 --> 03:24:09,000
Like that's the only way to go for it.

1940
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:11,000
It sounds like it's not going to be the case here.

1941
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:13,000
Well, if we're doing our job right that yeah.

1942
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:16,000
And with so many of the sentences as well.

1943
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:18,000
Got a lot of choices.

1944
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:26,000
Originally, the plan was to like have all of the POE one ascendancies available and it was some sort of weird split campaign stuff and all that.

1945
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:27,000
I don't really know at this point.

1946
03:24:27,000 --> 03:24:28,000
It's a bit confusing.

1947
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:29,000
It's you mentioned that either.

1948
03:24:29,000 --> 03:24:31,000
So it sounds like some of them are coming forwards.

1949
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000
But is it all just being I think it's more down at this point?

1950
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:35,000
Yeah, at this point, they'll just be different.

1951
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:36,000
Right.

1952
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:39,000
Originally way back when we were planning on just keeping the ascendancies as they were.

1953
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:40,000
Yeah.

1954
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:47,000
But at this point, that wouldn't even be good enough because like it doesn't fit the kind of like path of Excel to way of designing this thing.

1955
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:53,000
So yeah, I mean, like we might have a class called the dead eye and it might have the same themes, but it'll be like different actual mechanics and different things.

1956
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:54,000
Yeah.

1957
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:58,000
I mean, yeah, even the dead eye, you got tailwind works differently.

1958
03:24:58,000 --> 03:25:00,000
You've still got an additional projectile.

1959
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:03,000
You know, like there are there are things that certainly carry over.

1960
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:12,000
But it's really easy and it's honestly been fun just looking at them going like, you know, now we have all these system changes, all these skills and everything works like this.

1961
03:25:12,000 --> 03:25:14,000
Just what would the perfect class be?

1962
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:17,000
Not like how can we retrofit and band aid appear?

1963
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:18,000
We want class to work.

1964
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:21,000
It's just way better to look at it and go, here's all the things we want.

1965
03:25:21,000 --> 03:25:22,000
Yeah.

1966
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:29,000
So well, yeah, like when you have now the life and mana flask and stuff, it could obviously things don't work quite the same.

1967
03:25:29,000 --> 03:25:31,000
But then now you have the charm system and also.

1968
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:33,000
I actually wonder if Pathfinder would be cool with that.

1969
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:34,000
Exactly.

1970
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:35,000
About like stacking charms.

1971
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:42,000
So it's it's just here are, you know, 12 eventually 36 classes.

1972
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:47,000
It's not really like here's the peer we want counterpart and they're identical kind of thing anymore for sure.

1973
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:51,000
Too many things changed for that to even be possible anyway.

1974
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:52,000
Yeah. All right.

1975
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:54,000
Sounds very epic.

1976
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:58,000
We can skip over the flasks and trinkets as we did cover that very well.

1977
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:06,000
So moving into skills, I realized I like had many pages of questions here and then I was like, wait, we haven't even talked about like skills here.

1978
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:11,000
It's so much to so much to for us to discover over the course of this beta.

1979
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:14,000
How is the list of skills been shaping up overall?

1980
03:26:14,000 --> 03:26:16,000
I mean, it's certainly getting there.

1981
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:20,000
I mean, look, there are even certain skills that won't even make it even just within the classes we have.

1982
03:26:20,000 --> 03:26:27,000
Like there are still going to be more some more skills coming later on as well for the for these classes because there are more skills that we got just about there.

1983
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:29,000
And yeah, it didn't quite didn't quite make it.

1984
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:30,000
So yeah.

1985
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:37,000
And like getting a class finished in terms of the skills you need, like it sort of seems very easy when you come up.

1986
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:41,000
OK, we need like, you know, 22, 23, 24, you know, number of skills, something like that.

1987
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:44,000
And it seems like that's not so many and you kind of design them.

1988
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:50,000
But when you actually come up with all of the things, you know, the way they interact together, you know, the number of prototypes you have to do that kind of don't really work.

1989
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:53,000
And, you know, like you end up not being fun.

1990
03:26:54,000 --> 03:27:01,000
And then, of course, the support, Jim stuff like you need to make sure that every skill has enough viable supports so that you can actually even recommend people to do.

1991
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:05,000
Then you need things like the, you know, the passive tree support for all of them.

1992
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:12,000
You need to have all of the the stuff with like buff, the buff gems for each character class as well.

1993
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:17,000
You know, you need to be thinking about uniques for the for the type of, you know, for the that can work with these things.

1994
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:20,000
It's just like there's so many different elements to actually make skills work.

1995
03:27:20,000 --> 03:27:26,000
And once again, it's another area, I think, that was underestimated to some degree before.

1996
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:30,000
And, you know, like it does take a to actually get that finished.

1997
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:34,000
It takes a lot. So, yeah, that's been a total struggle.

1998
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:37,000
And we didn't think we would have to have only six character classes initially.

1999
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:41,000
The start of early access, we were thinking we would have eight to begin with.

2000
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:47,000
But, yeah, when it actually came down to actually getting to actually finish something, you know, like it just ended up being too much.

2001
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:52,000
So, you know, now, obviously, we've got a bunch of work on more of the classes that we've done.

2002
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:54,000
You know, there's things there.

2003
03:27:54,000 --> 03:28:01,000
But it's that finishing work of like making sure that all the systems in the game come together to support, you know, how that how that works.

2004
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:02,000
That requires a lot.

2005
03:28:02,000 --> 03:28:08,000
Doing all of that as we're still discovering how we want those systems to work, you know, like the changes to support gems and all that.

2006
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:14,000
As we're also making support gems, as we're making character classes just can cause things to slow down quite a bit.

2007
03:28:14,000 --> 03:28:16,000
And then we have to recalibrate and all.

2008
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:23,000
Yeah, like it is it was an extreme amount of work that we certainly predicted poorly.

2009
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:31,000
But that was also because we are making all these cool systems, all these changes to all these systems, which are having immense benefits as well.

2010
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:38,000
So, yeah, I would say it's pretty safe to expect that, you know, as much as you can't play them on day zero,

2011
03:28:38,000 --> 03:28:48,000
a lot of some of those other classes that we have shown in the past and some of the skills and stuff, there's a lot there, like just not to make it seem like it's shallow or anything.

2012
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:50,000
But we will be adding those classes in for sure.

2013
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:59,000
Yeah, the thing that keeps like surprising me is well, when you click that old gems tab, when you're doing it on cut, there's quite a lot of skills in there.

2014
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:06,000
But you initially kind of box yourself away where you think, OK, so I'm playing the mercenary, so I'm just looking at the crossbow skills.

2015
03:29:06,000 --> 03:29:11,000
And then I was like, well, what if I go look at the elemental skills and then I find flame wall and I'm like, oh, I can shoot my projectiles through that.

2016
03:29:11,000 --> 03:29:18,000
OK, cool. I like that. But that's like surface level because you also have the weapon swap thing and you can actually viably do with the automated weapon swapping.

2017
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:26,000
It's not like toxic where you have to push the button a bunch of times and you've got the trees that like customize whenever you do it automatically on the fly.

2018
03:29:26,000 --> 03:29:31,000
All of a sudden I'm like, oh, well, why can't I use a sword on the other hand?

2019
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:35,000
That's actually a very cool mercenary vibe sword and crossbow.

2020
03:29:35,000 --> 03:29:50,000
So yeah, I mean, that stuff is like is crazy. I mean, like in the in the actually there was one in the community guys recorded where they were using a bell, the bell skill with the quarter staff with the rapid shot mercenary skill.

2021
03:29:50,000 --> 03:30:00,000
And when I saw it, oh, man, you know, it's like a whole other thing. Yeah, like that. I didn't even know about that about that particular combo until I saw it in the some of the footage they recorded.

2022
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:07,000
I started thinking about that too with like multiplayer. I was like, sorry, I was throwing my gas grenades, which you can blow up with your explosive grenades.

2023
03:30:07,000 --> 03:30:12,000
But then I was throwing at a boss that was doing burning ground and they were blowing up instantly. I'm like, oh, wait, so it reacts to the environment.

2024
03:30:12,000 --> 03:30:17,000
Well, it's obviously going to react to my friends doing burning ground. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And I'm a flame wall friend.

2025
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:27,000
And this and this is the reason like this conversation here is the reason why there's going to be crazy builds that we don't anticipate because like the like like like some of the stuff that can happen between classes.

2026
03:30:27,000 --> 03:30:32,000
And we just have no doubt we will not have discovered. Yeah. Like how much have you really been able to test?

2027
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:38,000
I mean, like we do test party play all the time. Marks, Marks, like the final words. I'm the support character player.

2028
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:44,000
Now I'm like freezing armor breaking, putting down clouds slowly. You know, holy, there's just a lot going on.

2029
03:30:44,000 --> 03:30:48,000
And I'm not just standing there like I got buffs coming out of me.

2030
03:30:49,000 --> 03:30:57,000
You know, it's like, you know, you're like, I'm actually doing all this active support and like different conditions to synergize with the group and how you're doing that.

2031
03:30:57,000 --> 03:31:04,000
OK, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just do this and enhance my armor breaking and go ballistic armor breaking and you just spam your thing that consumes it.

2032
03:31:04,000 --> 03:31:15,000
You know, so you get a lot of that stuff going on for sure where I but you know, it it's kind of honestly the terrifying part as well where it's like.

2033
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:23,000
What do we have? We had the whole like vulnerability curse with with gas cloud ticks or something and it was like literally applying armor break like every frame.

2034
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:26,000
And so you have the monsters going to get armor explosion on there.

2035
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:29,000
Yeah. And then you have some other thing. You have some other guy consuming it.

2036
03:31:29,000 --> 03:31:34,000
And again, I'm a guy cool rain. Just don't know how many bloody synergistic things with cool rain.

2037
03:31:34,000 --> 03:31:39,000
You can do a lot with that. All the lightning arrows on the ground and because they can, you know, lightning things hit them and explode.

2038
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:43,000
And all of a sudden now you're just everyone's running around with cool rain spamming lightning rods everywhere.

2039
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:48,000
Yeah. And frost wall. Somehow frost wall. We had about 15 abuse cases.

2040
03:31:48,000 --> 03:31:51,000
I mean, that's historically accurate. Yeah.

2041
03:31:51,000 --> 03:31:57,000
Can I blast frost walls and all that? It returns. Sounds like it's coming back.

2042
03:31:57,000 --> 03:32:01,000
It'll be fun. It's cool. Even finding all the stuff so far has been really fun.

2043
03:32:01,000 --> 03:32:07,000
But yeah, I generally play multiplayer. Most of the alpha I've done is being in multiplayer, play with other people.

2044
03:32:07,000 --> 03:32:12,000
It's good to get a lot of that testing in there as well. Not a lot of others do it.

2045
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:17,000
And then, yeah, try and see what we can break just for good fun.

2046
03:32:17,000 --> 03:32:23,000
Honestly, the thing it's like hardest to then like because you get this thing, which is quite interesting.

2047
03:32:23,000 --> 03:32:26,000
We have a staff is both the player and a developer.

2048
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:29,000
And I'm off the light. Don't you? You better not keep that.

2049
03:32:29,000 --> 03:32:34,000
You know, something that's I want to exploit, but you know, something that's Opie a secret, right?

2050
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:40,000
You better tell me because you were saying people weren't telling you about exactly like you get a situation.

2051
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:44,000
Someone doesn't want to tell you about their build, but because they're like, oh, Michael Nerf it then.

2052
03:32:44,000 --> 03:32:52,000
Like that's supposed to be making a meeting and, you know, whatever.

2053
03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:57,000
I was like, I swear, if I see any of you at the top of the ladder on day one, we're going to have a talk.

2054
03:32:57,000 --> 03:33:01,000
Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.

2055
03:33:01,000 --> 03:33:06,000
I did tell you about my flashbangs and maybe it's fine. I just don't. I just wanted them to check.

2056
03:33:06,000 --> 03:33:09,000
That is the thing that is hard. No one knows if the thing is actually brought.

2057
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:11,000
Look, there's a line that gets crossed. Yes.

2058
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:17,000
But sometimes you don't know, is it just I found something cool and it's powerful or have I found something cool and it's broken?

2059
03:33:17,000 --> 03:33:21,000
You know, and those things, I mean, we have to make those decisions, of course.

2060
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:23,000
And a lot of the time what is reported is just fine.

2061
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:27,000
And it's like, yeah, you've got a good weapon and you've got the right. You got this combo.

2062
03:33:27,000 --> 03:33:31,000
You're strong if it's if it's supported by items, then it's like fine to be very powerful.

2063
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:35,000
But if you're just like, I just pick these skills and no matter what weapons I'm wearing, I'm just like completely ridiculous.

2064
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:43,000
Then that's a different situation, because now it's just a thing that anyone can do at a moment's notice rather than actually requiring like, you know, I have to find the big combo of items and things like that.

2065
03:33:43,000 --> 03:33:46,000
So that's a much different story.

2066
03:33:46,000 --> 03:33:52,000
We've had a lot of good testing, a lot of good feedback, a lot of good people reporting that stuff, especially in the last month.

2067
03:33:52,000 --> 03:33:56,000
It's like coming in a lot because there's the systems and everything's kind of stabilizing.

2068
03:33:56,000 --> 03:33:58,000
You start to get a lot more of that.

2069
03:33:58,000 --> 03:34:07,000
And people are understanding what the difficulties meant to be and what the power of characters is meant to be as all of that came and started to stabilize.

2070
03:34:07,000 --> 03:34:10,000
We've got a lot more of this coming in and we are kind of getting more understanding.

2071
03:34:10,000 --> 03:34:15,000
But again, you'll never find them all. But, you know, it's fun. Good fun journey.

2072
03:34:15,000 --> 03:34:17,000
Support gems have changed a lot.

2073
03:34:17,000 --> 03:34:26,000
However, you found the changes to them being now having no levels and the restriction of having only one support gem on your character of a type, but having a lot more of them.

2074
03:34:26,000 --> 03:34:34,000
I really like how this works. I think that it adds so much more build diversity and interest to have to be making the decision of like, you know, where is this going to go?

2075
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:41,000
And the thing that's been important, though, with that system is it requires a lot more support gems to exist because you need one on your character.

2076
03:34:41,000 --> 03:34:46,000
You need tons of them. And like you need like you need a lot of different ways to increase damage and a lot of ways to support different mechanics.

2077
03:34:46,000 --> 03:34:50,000
It's like if you're going to have something like freeze, like, you know, you're going to have a freezing skill.

2078
03:34:50,000 --> 03:34:53,000
You need to be able to support that and augment that and like many different ways.

2079
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:58,000
And there needs to be more options than what you can even like there needs to be in order to have choice.

2080
03:34:58,000 --> 03:35:01,000
You can't just have five. Here's your five freeze things. And that's all you do. Right.

2081
03:35:01,000 --> 03:35:05,000
There has to be more than that in order to be able to have it. So you actually have some choices as well.

2082
03:35:05,000 --> 03:35:09,000
So that kind of stuff has meant that you just need a lot of things going on there.

2083
03:35:09,000 --> 03:35:14,000
But I think that the choices that you end up with as a player of like, you know, where do I put my model projectiles? Where do I put my piece?

2084
03:35:14,000 --> 03:35:26,000
I think that leads to a lot more interesting decisions with how you build and, you know, like, yeah, I think that to me is where a lot of the why it just works so much better.

2085
03:35:26,000 --> 03:35:34,000
And we were certainly hesitant about the whole, you know, you can only have one support per character thing because it sounds bad if you just hear about it as a player without actually playing it.

2086
03:35:34,000 --> 03:35:39,000
You just hear that. You're like, oh, it's just a restriction. And it is arbitrary in some sense. Right.

2087
03:35:40,000 --> 03:35:44,000
We can't justify it thematically, really. It's just it's just it is what it is.

2088
03:35:44,000 --> 03:35:51,000
And so I really don't like that kind of thing usually, because if I'm going to I want the theme to match the mechanic as much as possible.

2089
03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:56,000
But in this case, it just made the gameplay so much better that like it just had to happen.

2090
03:35:56,000 --> 03:36:02,000
So arguably, if you if you need to, if you end up in a situation where you like I have to put the support on every slot.

2091
03:36:02,000 --> 03:36:06,000
Exactly. That is less choice. And that's the reason why the gameplay is bad. Less choice, less interest.

2092
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:10,000
And also, you may as well just bake that now into the skills and or 100 percent.

2093
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:15,000
And so this is the thing. It is actually much worse to have that because it results in this outcome.

2094
03:36:15,000 --> 03:36:21,000
But like that's a kind of more subtle argument that's like you have to kind of make to people if you want to kind of convince them this is actually the right way.

2095
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:26,000
Because when you tell people, oh, there's this restriction, it doesn't sound like what they're getting out of that is more choice.

2096
03:36:26,000 --> 03:36:34,000
It sounds like they're getting less. But the reality is it is actually more choice because you no longer have like mandatory like here's the here's the five mandatory things you have to put on the skill.

2097
03:36:34,000 --> 03:36:47,000
It's like is actually much more going on. I think it's much better helped realize my experience on the mercenary that you your vision of having like all of these skills available to you and them actually being worth using for sure.

2098
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:52,000
Because if you had all the same support gems, I feel like you just pick the one that does the most damage and you make it do the most damage.

2099
03:36:52,000 --> 03:36:57,000
And that's the only skill you use. And I mean, the great thing is, is now it's completely reasonable to have a skill in your character that you just use occasionally.

2100
03:36:57,000 --> 03:37:02,000
Right. Like every five minutes, you might have a situation where you need to use that. And that's actually fine and completely reasonable.

2101
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:12,000
Yeah. So I'm playing a Grenada and I would be like, OK, I should only use this grenade normally is what I would be like in part of exile because this is the best grenade or maybe this one that does like interacts with it in some way.

2102
03:37:12,000 --> 03:37:24,000
The obvious combo. But now I'm actually like, well, there's a reason I could use those lightning ones to apply shock because I have all these shock support gems that I'm not using anywhere else because I'm using the damage and the LMP on my big damage dealers.

2103
03:37:25,000 --> 03:37:33,000
I can use I can put the shock things on there and I can actually have a shock set up. I can incorporate that into my build. I can incorporate poison into my build to strip their armor and whatnot.

2104
03:37:33,000 --> 03:37:43,000
And maybe I only use that occasionally when you face something that's got heavy armor. Yeah. Yeah. It's like that. That's why I really want to be viable. And that situational stuff, I think, just makes the game way more interesting.

2105
03:37:43,000 --> 03:37:49,000
It's it's really feeding into the flavor of mercenaries like this, like prepared kind of fighter who has all these tools at their disposal as well.

2106
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:56,000
Like, you're like, I have this grenade for if I get into this situation, this grenade for this one. It's like, I love it.

2107
03:37:56,000 --> 03:38:04,000
A couple of questions here. People definitely been asking about like vile skills and transfigured gems and stuff like that. I feel like this sort of thing doesn't make sense at launch.

2108
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:09,000
Yeah, because ultimately, if we're going to add something like that, it would make sense to add it just as another skill.

2109
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:15,000
So at this point, there's no real reason to do that. Like that kind of stuff comes in. We want to have a specific reward system somewhere that wants to be able to do that.

2110
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:21,000
And so we don't really need to do it right now. But you look, we might decide to bring that theme back and, you know, in a reward system.

2111
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:25,000
I think the vile skills, especially it's a cool flavor. Yeah, for sure.

2112
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:38,000
But I think the transfigured thing is also interesting. Like, you know, if you're looking to be able to like the reason why transfigured was nice is because it's like we got to sort of iterate on a bunch of different themes around the same skill, which obviously at this point, we don't need to do that because we've got to.

2113
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:44,000
We're already still adding the skills, you know what I mean? So all the iterations of it are like less of a necessary thing.

2114
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:48,000
But yeah, I mean, I'm sure we'll be doing more stuff like that in the future. We absolutely will be.

2115
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:53,000
Do you know how many skills roughly you have, Sasha, going to end up with?

2116
03:38:53,000 --> 03:39:00,000
You know, I actually don't know the number off the top of my head. But what I will say is that we initially, I think when we announced like what the full game would have, we said 240.

2117
03:39:00,000 --> 03:39:05,000
I'm pretty sure we're actually nearing that. I feel definitely it's going to be way higher than that.

2118
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:08,000
Yeah, because we're nearing that now when we've only added half the classes.

2119
03:39:08,000 --> 03:39:11,000
So I think that that means that there's going to be a lot more than that.

2120
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:16,000
Like a hundred or whatever, like some little utility skill or whatever. But there's even if you discount for those.

2121
03:39:16,000 --> 03:39:19,000
Yeah, I know. No, that's what I mean. Yeah, you got what?

2122
03:39:19,000 --> 03:39:26,000
Because there's 20 to 25 for each of those for each class. And so just with six of those, I'm terrible at math in my head.

2123
03:39:26,000 --> 03:39:34,000
But I feel like that's 120. Well, let's say it's just a bit over 110 or something.

2124
03:39:34,000 --> 03:39:39,000
End up around there. 120 something like that. Around. Yeah, I think probably 120.

2125
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:45,000
Around there like that. But then you've also got all the buff gems as well. And like each character class has nine of those.

2126
03:39:45,000 --> 03:39:50,000
So that then sort of adds up. So you've already reached probably 200 just by the time you've got to there.

2127
03:39:51,000 --> 03:39:57,000
And then it doesn't even count things that really are skills, but like you don't get them via a skill gem.

2128
03:39:57,000 --> 03:40:01,000
So like we're talking about all the ascendancy little skills and there's like uniques that have little skill things on them.

2129
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:05,000
All staffs, wands and sceptres have a skill back to them.

2130
03:40:05,000 --> 03:40:08,000
Exactly. We're not even counting that, right? Because the staffs, wands and sceptres have skills built in.

2131
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:13,000
And then those are like, how many of those? There's like 20 of those probably.

2132
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:17,000
Yeah, I mean. But if you add them all up. I don't know who remembers all these things.

2133
03:40:18,000 --> 03:40:23,000
No one has counted recently. But there's a bunch. Countless skills.

2134
03:40:23,000 --> 03:40:28,000
And there's ascendancy classes with skills. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tons. Yeah.

2135
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:33,000
And those skills, those skills, by the way, ascendancy class skills are fully supportable. Yeah.

2136
03:40:33,000 --> 03:40:37,000
Yeah, that's wild. Because I remember I did the thing with default attack where you can support that now.

2137
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:40,000
You can support default attack and you can support any skill that comes from something.

2138
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:43,000
That one caught me by surprise. I was like, oh wow, you can actually link those up.

2139
03:40:43,000 --> 03:40:47,000
Yep. It's yes. So you're going to end up with quite a lot going on there.

2140
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:51,000
I was even surprised when I was like, oh, I can add, you know, additional accuracy to Herald of Ice.

2141
03:40:51,000 --> 03:40:55,000
And it like provides a buff to my character. I can like add buffs through support gems.

2142
03:40:55,000 --> 03:41:02,000
You know why that is though, because those things like Heralds are so hard to find like a good set of supports to recommend.

2143
03:41:02,000 --> 03:41:05,000
So like, damn, we have tons of these now. They're like really difficult.

2144
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:08,000
You can like create a custom aura. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

2145
03:41:08,000 --> 03:41:21,000
So yeah, it's that actually mean it's actually nice because part of the it means that you get the feeling of having more aura effects on your character without having to have the spam of actual auras that every many characters had in here we won.

2146
03:41:21,000 --> 03:41:25,000
But you get to kind of have all that stuff as well. So that's been really nice.

2147
03:41:25,000 --> 03:41:29,000
Thanks for the invisible aura MTX.

2148
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:45,000
Well, it does remind me though. So with all the is very off topic, but with all the very good teasers you've been doing for like new 3D art for Unix and stuff like that, have you had any thoughts about reworking the transfer skin transfer MTX in some way, making it more permanent?

2149
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:51,000
Honestly, it's not in our thing about stuff we're thinking about, you know, like the same way it works for now, at least.

2150
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:55,000
But obviously skin transfer in Peewee 2 there's a lot more cool base art.

2151
03:41:55,000 --> 03:41:58,000
Yeah, that's gonna make people actually want to use it now.

2152
03:41:58,000 --> 03:42:00,000
So you're probably using that a lot more.

2153
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:03,000
So yeah, it'd be cool to see something for that in the future potentially.

2154
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:07,000
So on to the end game, which was, I feel like a big bulk of the announcement for sure.

2155
03:42:07,000 --> 03:42:09,000
Yeah.

2156
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:16,000
So just as like an overview. So we have the end game versions just for beta launch, by the way.

2157
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:18,000
Because it's gonna be a lot more later.

2158
03:42:18,000 --> 03:42:22,000
So we have the end game pinnacle versions of the two trials.

2159
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:27,000
So as like fully farmable content. They don't have trees though, those ones.

2160
03:42:27,000 --> 03:42:29,000
They don't have trees, but they do have a progression system of some kind.

2161
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:33,000
So you've got the relics in the Sanctum sequel.

2162
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:42,000
And then for the Trial of Chaos, you have the inscribed automatums have getting mods from the end.

2163
03:42:42,000 --> 03:42:50,000
So when you kill the final boss of that, which is alleged to be the trial master.

2164
03:42:50,000 --> 03:42:52,000
Alleged?

2165
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:58,000
Yeah. Then he'll drop items that can then have mods on them to make the trial itself harder.

2166
03:42:58,000 --> 03:43:01,000
And there's also some pretty interesting ones on there that we actually were going to put in the video,

2167
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:04,000
but it was starting to get a bit long, which was that you've got the thing,

2168
03:43:04,000 --> 03:43:11,000
where you've got the bets that you can make of like, put up 13 exalts,

2169
03:43:11,000 --> 03:43:15,000
and then you might get double that back if you're able to complete the thing.

2170
03:43:15,000 --> 03:43:17,000
So those are some of the mods that can spawn on there.

2171
03:43:17,000 --> 03:43:19,000
As well as mods that make the actual trial harder as well.

2172
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:21,000
So there's things like that as well.

2173
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:23,000
So yeah, those two have those kind of like different outside the Atlas tree,

2174
03:43:23,000 --> 03:43:25,000
because they're not really part of the Atlas.

2175
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:27,000
You'll get keys for them while you're playing end game.

2176
03:43:27,000 --> 03:43:31,000
But technically speaking, they're kind of like, they scale to end game,

2177
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:33,000
but they're not like sort of part of the whole Atlas.

2178
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:35,000
You don't play them there.

2179
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:37,000
Yeah, so they're their own distinct end game too.

2180
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:41,000
So there'll be three rogue-like dungeon things that will be...

2181
03:43:41,000 --> 03:43:42,000
Sure, sure, sure.

2182
03:43:42,000 --> 03:43:43,000
...like distinct end games.

2183
03:43:43,000 --> 03:43:45,000
I wouldn't say three rogue-like dungeons.

2184
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:49,000
I will say there'll be three trials that have various mechanics that can be different.

2185
03:43:49,000 --> 03:43:55,000
But then of course you've got the four, kind of what I guess would say sort of...

2186
03:43:55,000 --> 03:43:57,000
I don't know, we actually need a name for what...

2187
03:43:57,000 --> 03:44:00,000
What are we calling the things that are icons on the...

2188
03:44:00,000 --> 03:44:02,000
Because they were called leagues, but they're not really leagues.

2189
03:44:02,000 --> 03:44:04,000
Yeah, it doesn't really make sense to call it a league exactly.

2190
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:06,000
That is what we call them internally.

2191
03:44:06,000 --> 03:44:07,000
We just refer to them as leagues.

2192
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:10,000
There are four leagues that you have that appear there.

2193
03:44:10,000 --> 03:44:12,000
It doesn't really work anymore, does it?

2194
03:44:12,000 --> 03:44:14,000
I don't have a good idea right now.

2195
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:17,000
We probably have actually named it. I just don't remember what it is.

2196
03:44:17,000 --> 03:44:21,000
And then you've got the kind of boss hunting kind of element as well.

2197
03:44:21,000 --> 03:44:25,000
And then I guess what you would say is the pinnacle of the kind of boss hunting thing is the end game.

2198
03:44:25,000 --> 03:44:28,000
You've got the cities with the lieutenants and then the Uber Act bosses.

2199
03:44:28,000 --> 03:44:31,000
And then above that you have the pinnacle boss who we don't want to spoil.

2200
03:44:31,000 --> 03:44:36,000
Although I did show you a little bit about it just in private before.

2201
03:44:36,000 --> 03:44:39,000
But yeah, that one's going to be hard.

2202
03:44:39,000 --> 03:44:43,000
I know you're cooking up some pretty difficult mechanics there.

2203
03:44:43,000 --> 03:44:46,000
Yeah, it's fun. That's the fun stuff.

2204
03:44:46,000 --> 03:44:49,000
Because now you don't need to worry about if people can't progress through.

2205
03:44:49,000 --> 03:44:53,000
It's not a progression blocker. You can just kill them.

2206
03:44:53,000 --> 03:44:57,000
It's a progression blocker to the higher difficulties though.

2207
03:44:57,000 --> 03:45:00,000
Because once you kill that, then you get the increase of the difficulties.

2208
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:03,000
And then it's like, okay, now try it again, but way harder.

2209
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:08,000
And then there's four levels of difficulty for each end game system like that.

2210
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:13,000
So yeah, apart from the trials, the end game trials, everything has its own distinct passive tree.

2211
03:45:13,000 --> 03:45:16,000
And progression through them is also by doing them.

2212
03:45:16,000 --> 03:45:17,000
Yes, exactly.

2213
03:45:17,000 --> 03:45:22,000
So we really wanted to prevent the situation where you feel like you allocate points for a certain piece of content.

2214
03:45:22,000 --> 03:45:26,000
And then you feel like you can't do the other content because you're kind of wasting the points that you've got.

2215
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:27,000
Yeah, the lock-in.

2216
03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:31,000
And we kind of band-aided that in P.O.E. 1 by adding multiple Atlas trees as a way.

2217
03:45:31,000 --> 03:45:34,000
But I think the solution is much better where effectively you can progress all of them.

2218
03:45:34,000 --> 03:45:38,000
And you can either do just all-in-one for a while, or you can just do each of them as you come to them.

2219
03:45:38,000 --> 03:45:40,000
And just add them kind of piecemeal.

2220
03:45:40,000 --> 03:45:45,000
But either way, however you want to do it, you can make progress on your character.

2221
03:45:45,000 --> 03:45:48,000
Well, I should say in your league for all of those.

2222
03:45:48,000 --> 03:45:53,000
Because the progress and all that stuff is of course for the whole league, not just for a single character.

2223
03:45:53,000 --> 03:46:00,000
Yeah, and previously we used the Atlas tree, I would say very much so, to make sure that we were doing the type of content that we wanted to do.

2224
03:46:00,000 --> 03:46:03,000
Yeah, so now it's not so much about finding the content because that's what the tablets are for.

2225
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:10,000
Now it's more about improving your ability to sustain effectively.

2226
03:46:10,000 --> 03:46:13,000
You're going to want to have those points to get sustainability for the next level up.

2227
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:17,000
We want to make sure that there is sustain if you're engaging with those mechanics well.

2228
03:46:17,000 --> 03:46:21,000
But effectively you do have to actually, to get sustain at higher difficulties,

2229
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:27,000
you will need to be able to be making smart choices in terms of allocating and using the tablets correctly and that kind of stuff.

2230
03:46:27,000 --> 03:46:30,000
It is part of that sort of story of all of that.

2231
03:46:30,000 --> 03:46:33,000
So yeah, that's kind of the main thing with that.

2232
03:46:33,000 --> 03:46:39,000
Yeah, this idea of sustaining the content you want to do by doing it is a little different to how it's been in P1 a lot of the time.

2233
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:42,000
Where it's like you had to fuel it by going back to maps.

2234
03:46:42,000 --> 03:46:53,000
I mean you're still doing maps ultimately, but effectively as long as you're doing the content that you want to do, and making it harder,

2235
03:46:53,000 --> 03:46:58,000
so your build has to be good enough to be able to sustain it, then you will be able to sustain that stuff.

2236
03:46:58,000 --> 03:47:05,000
If you want every single map to have a breach in it, that's absolutely doable by using the tablets correctly.

2237
03:47:05,000 --> 03:47:13,000
Yeah, so the Atlas passive trees and the trees for each of the distinct types of content is about scaling the reward and difficulty primarily.

2238
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2239
03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:21,000
And what does, I saw like on the breach nodes it said like increased difficulty. What does that mean?

2240
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:32,000
It's somewhat arbitrary and asymmetric, but it will feel like, for example, some of the difficulties will actually change the boss's skills and how they work.

2241
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:43,000
Generally they'll increase like the level of the area, right, so you get the general monster and life scaling, but arguably to a player that's arbitrary as well, because they don't know how that scales.

2242
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:50,000
And in other contexts here might be more of certain monster types, less of others and stuff like that.

2243
03:47:50,000 --> 03:48:00,000
It is generally that yes, the small nodes will increase difficulty of the meta content, whereas the large, the notables will increase the reward of the in-map content.

2244
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:11,000
But when I say difficulty, that is reward as well. So an example of how this works is like, let's say the boss has six uniques it could drop, or five or six uniques.

2245
03:48:11,000 --> 03:48:22,000
It can drop three at difficulty zero, then at say difficulty one, it can drop, you know, maybe has increased level or higher item level, some rarity.

2246
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:32,000
You know, now also that when I say rarity, also do note rarity does increase the grade of items, not just making them yellow or orange.

2247
03:48:32,000 --> 03:48:36,000
It does make them better yellows or better oranges.

2248
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:39,000
It does affect, yeah, it affects other things about items than just the rarity.

2249
03:48:39,000 --> 03:48:48,000
Yes. And so yeah, when I talk about just getting rarity here, I don't want people to, in P1 players in particular, to think, ah, they're just going to go from yellow to more yellow.

2250
03:48:49,000 --> 03:48:57,000
So anyway, and, you know, maybe the next tier will add a unique to the pool, like a more, you know, what we hope will be more valuable unique.

2251
03:48:57,000 --> 03:49:02,000
And then the next one can do a bit more rarity, something else maybe introduce a different unique perhaps.

2252
03:49:02,000 --> 03:49:17,000
And then the last difficulty introduces something ideally, you know, without giving away exact specifics of them, more in the line of a modular unique item, say like Megalomaniac or like Forbidden Flesh and Flame from P1.

2253
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:25,000
So a unique item that is like ideally very powerful, very chase, but has a lot of different combinations.

2254
03:49:25,000 --> 03:49:27,000
Watchers Eyes, another good example, right?

2255
03:49:27,000 --> 03:49:31,000
So a new series of jewels is a good example.

2256
03:49:31,000 --> 03:49:34,000
There are other uniques that are modular and stuff, and that comes in at the last tier.

2257
03:49:34,000 --> 03:49:37,000
And so you want to really be getting to that hardest difficulty.

2258
03:49:37,000 --> 03:49:42,000
So you can be getting these like farming for these extremely good, powerful, unique items.

2259
03:49:43,000 --> 03:49:50,000
But of course you have the thing if you're never ready for it, if you try it and you're like, oh, this is too hard, you can always just respect the nodes.

2260
03:49:50,000 --> 03:49:56,000
You can unspec them away and then not, you know, like just effectively decide like I've got these points, but I'm not.

2261
03:49:56,000 --> 03:49:58,000
Yeah, I want to go back and do this later.

2262
03:49:58,000 --> 03:50:00,000
And so that ability to effectively configure the difficulty like that, I think.

2263
03:50:00,000 --> 03:50:07,000
So if you're maybe target farming one of the base, one of the uniques, the difficulty zero drops, you might want to just be like, I'll do that.

2264
03:50:07,000 --> 03:50:10,000
I'll do the difficulty stuff later and I'll just farm it at this difficulty.

2265
03:50:10,000 --> 03:50:15,000
And I think that's a much better way than some of the systems have used to scale down in the past.

2266
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:22,000
And the nice thing is, of course, with difficulty is that we can effectively get what use whatever scaling levers we want to make that more difficult without necessarily having to like,

2267
03:50:22,000 --> 03:50:25,000
because we could have been like, oh, you know, you increase difficulty, it's like 200 percent life or something like that.

2268
03:50:25,000 --> 03:50:32,000
But by effectively being a bit more vague about it, we can actually like specifically tailor the difficulties of the different tiers, like, you know, with more specific changes.

2269
03:50:32,000 --> 03:50:35,000
Yeah, this like multiple projectile thing you shoot has more projectiles.

2270
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:36,000
Sure, and that kind of thing.

2271
03:50:36,000 --> 03:50:39,000
So, you know, whatever we feel works best for making this particular fight more difficult.

2272
03:50:39,000 --> 03:50:43,000
It seems like there's a lot more players to kind of discover experimentally there as they progress.

2273
03:50:43,000 --> 03:50:44,000
For sure.

2274
03:50:44,000 --> 03:50:45,000
In what way are they getting harder?

2275
03:50:45,000 --> 03:50:51,000
And that is going to be different for different players, too, where like a different build is affected by a difficulty change more so.

2276
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:52,000
Potentially.

2277
03:50:52,000 --> 03:51:06,000
And that's an interesting question as well, I think, where how much are you guys pitching these sorts of distinct end game pieces of content at being like completable by the same build or by encouraging players to make a different build that's better at certain content?

2278
03:51:06,000 --> 03:51:08,000
So this is this is a very difficult one.

2279
03:51:08,000 --> 03:51:23,000
And it's something that we've discussed a bit recently is like the harder you make the hardest content, the less builds will be considered viable by the players because effectively like a build is only viable if it can defeat like, you know, the pinnacle boss at difficulty four.

2280
03:51:23,000 --> 03:51:25,000
That would be kind of the general perception.

2281
03:51:25,000 --> 03:51:29,000
So we have to be really like I actually don't know necessarily what the right answer here is.

2282
03:51:29,000 --> 03:51:31,000
Like we have the ability.

2283
03:51:31,000 --> 03:51:35,000
I mean, maybe you feel like you do, but I don't think I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent confident on it.

2284
03:51:35,000 --> 03:51:39,000
But, you know, I'll I'll have a go at it.

2285
03:51:39,000 --> 03:51:51,000
Look, there's going to be iteration here because what we'll see is like, you know, if we find that like, you know, there's only like some particularly abuses like only the most abusive stuff is possibly able to defeat the hardest content that we might have to dial it back a bit.

2286
03:51:51,000 --> 03:51:53,000
Yeah, but it's kind of going to be a bit of experimentation.

2287
03:51:53,000 --> 03:52:07,000
And it's very hard at this point to be able to pitch that because we don't have the crazy, you know, P we do does not have the history of P we won to be able to, you know, to know kind of what like what is the right life value to have on a difficulty for pinnacle boss.

2288
03:52:07,000 --> 03:52:15,000
Like, yeah, how do we even know that at this point really without that being said, though, like the bosses are a lot more skill based and tactical.

2289
03:52:15,000 --> 03:52:24,000
Right. Like at the end of the day, the gear is to some degree necessary because no one can really make no mistake for some amount of time.

2290
03:52:24,000 --> 03:52:27,000
You know, so you do have that thing and you do need to mitigate certain things.

2291
03:52:27,000 --> 03:52:35,000
But like a lot of these are like very dodge roll tactical or using certain skills or mitigation tactics or whatever you do.

2292
03:52:35,000 --> 03:52:39,000
There's heaps of different things to bypass the things that make them hard for sure.

2293
03:52:39,000 --> 03:52:47,000
But I would say it is very much a lot of skill is involved, especially when it comes to some of these with dodge rolling.

2294
03:52:47,000 --> 03:52:53,000
Like I'm trying to emphasize that quite a bit or blocking, you know, if you want to do a different way about it.

2295
03:52:53,000 --> 03:52:56,000
I'm not to say you must block, but yes, dodge roll is a pretty key mechanic here.

2296
03:52:56,000 --> 03:53:01,000
And I'd say we're certainly upping the emphasis on using and using it well as you get into these higher tiers.

2297
03:53:01,000 --> 03:53:07,000
But gears always a way and combinations of uniques and passively and build is always a way to go.

2298
03:53:07,000 --> 03:53:13,000
I'm not good at dodge rolling. I'm going to get around that skill check and become strong enough to defeat the boss.

2299
03:53:13,000 --> 03:53:18,000
You know, or another skill like some sort of skill that helps you block or using skills in the mix is fine.

2300
03:53:18,000 --> 03:53:25,000
Yeah, but I would say pretty generally you can take I'd say any decent character you get pretty damn you get up all the way.

2301
03:53:25,000 --> 03:53:28,000
And as long as you're good enough, that is a way to defeat them.

2302
03:53:28,000 --> 03:53:32,000
I would say there's no real hard requirement on doing something crazy niche or out there or complicated.

2303
03:53:32,000 --> 03:53:35,000
You're certainly not going around of like, oh, this boss is fire immune or something.

2304
03:53:35,000 --> 03:53:38,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Thanks.

2305
03:53:38,000 --> 03:53:40,000
We've been through that already.

2306
03:53:40,000 --> 03:53:41,000
Yeah.

2307
03:53:41,000 --> 03:53:48,000
Excellent. So this this very cute Atlas, this infinitely expanding civilization map,

2308
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:51,000
ask Atlas, which I know you're particularly fond of, Jonathan.

2309
03:53:51,000 --> 03:53:52,000
Yeah.

2310
03:53:53,000 --> 03:53:56,000
What's the what's kind of the idea here?

2311
03:53:56,000 --> 03:53:58,000
Like, is the layout the same for everyone?

2312
03:53:58,000 --> 03:54:00,000
Is it the same across the league?

2313
03:54:00,000 --> 03:54:03,000
So it's the same for your characters in the league, but the layout is different for everyone.

2314
03:54:03,000 --> 03:54:06,000
It is random. So you're going to have to find stuff like it works like delve in this respect,

2315
03:54:06,000 --> 03:54:09,000
which is obviously a league that I was particularly a fan of.

2316
03:54:09,000 --> 03:54:16,000
So yeah, I'm still really I like I what I really wanted is I wanted a feeling of exploration in the Atlas.

2317
03:54:16,000 --> 03:54:22,000
And it's something that we sort of tried to do with the Atlas and we won with that feeling of kind of,

2318
03:54:22,000 --> 03:54:26,000
you know, having the connected areas and exploring, but it never really it didn't feel like exploration quite

2319
03:54:26,000 --> 03:54:28,000
in quite the same way that this does. Yeah.

2320
03:54:28,000 --> 03:54:30,000
So that's something I loved.

2321
03:54:30,000 --> 03:54:32,000
It was one of the reasons I love Delve.

2322
03:54:32,000 --> 03:54:35,000
And so that's, you know, kind of kind of where this was coming from.

2323
03:54:35,000 --> 03:54:42,000
And at the same time, it's sort of solving various other problems that we've always had where like one of the things

2324
03:54:42,000 --> 03:54:47,000
that's really cool to do is to be able to have things like, OK, like in this area, you've got like this item drops

2325
03:54:47,000 --> 03:54:50,000
and like that kind of thing, you know, like I guess in P1, you have Div cards.

2326
03:54:50,000 --> 03:54:56,000
But there was always a problem where if you have differences between in-game areas in a system that works like P1 does,

2327
03:54:56,000 --> 03:55:02,000
then effectively that's the only map people like whatever the best map is, that's the one everyone will run forever.

2328
03:55:02,000 --> 03:55:07,000
So effectively, we wanted to try and make sure that you actually like had an experience that had more variety

2329
03:55:07,000 --> 03:55:11,000
while still retaining the whole like I get to play the content that I want.

2330
03:55:11,000 --> 03:55:17,000
So ideally with the with the Atlas, we kind of get that we've got in P2, we get to kind of have both of the best of both worlds.

2331
03:55:17,000 --> 03:55:20,000
We get to make sure that there is some variety, you know, you feel like you're exploring.

2332
03:55:20,000 --> 03:55:25,000
But because once you've run a map that's run and now you have to move on and do it and find another one.

2333
03:55:25,000 --> 03:55:29,000
It's not just like the, you know, like just just play one map again and again and again.

2334
03:55:29,000 --> 03:55:31,000
But yet the content, you know, can be added to it.

2335
03:55:31,000 --> 03:55:36,000
You can do things if you if you like the particular maps, you know, because there are biomes and you can see them from far away.

2336
03:55:36,000 --> 03:55:38,000
You can be like, OK, I know there's a particular desert map that's great.

2337
03:55:39,000 --> 03:55:41,000
So I'm going to go for deserts and that's fine. You can do that kind of thing.

2338
03:55:41,000 --> 03:55:47,000
So, you know, like you've both got controllability, but also, you know, the ability for us to kind of make more variance.

2339
03:55:47,000 --> 03:55:51,000
You get a lot more very high satisfying spikes. Yeah.

2340
03:55:51,000 --> 03:55:55,000
Well, like, for example, you get more variables where you just have, OK, there are like four towers.

2341
03:55:55,000 --> 03:56:01,000
Really, you got a good tower cluster and you've got really good maps in that range.

2342
03:56:01,000 --> 03:56:05,000
So like, you know, there are maps and perfect.

2343
03:56:05,000 --> 03:56:12,000
So one, for example, you know, the range is effectively say, how do I quantify this?

2344
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:15,000
Like, say, 350 monsters up to 700 monsters. Yeah.

2345
03:56:15,000 --> 03:56:23,000
Whereas the range here is like 300 monsters up to like 1500 monsters, you know, much, much, much more drastic range.

2346
03:56:23,000 --> 03:56:28,000
Now, those numbers are up. Sure. But it is approximately the representation of the range.

2347
03:56:28,000 --> 03:56:30,000
Obviously, you then modified and add more to it and all of that.

2348
03:56:30,000 --> 03:56:38,000
So you will have some maps that are like extremely good with Delirium and some maps that are like way better with something more like Breach.

2349
03:56:38,000 --> 03:56:44,000
Yeah. Because Delirium enhances the monsters of the map, whereas Breach entirely adds the monsters.

2350
03:56:44,000 --> 03:56:50,000
And you will even have things where there are maps that are like way more magic monsters, way more rare monsters.

2351
03:56:50,000 --> 03:56:55,000
And so you probably want that with, you know, pick your league of your choosing and what not.

2352
03:56:55,000 --> 03:56:57,000
You have all these variables that are at play.

2353
03:56:57,000 --> 03:57:02,000
And so you all of a sudden find a really good set of towers with some really good maps and radius.

2354
03:57:02,000 --> 03:57:08,000
And then you'll get really good tablet modifiers and then you'll get really good maps with really good prefixes.

2355
03:57:08,000 --> 03:57:13,000
And you want to just combine all of this and you obviously instill them all and you corrupt them all.

2356
03:57:13,000 --> 03:57:16,000
And there's the corruption influence.

2357
03:57:16,000 --> 03:57:18,000
And so then there's the corruption influence on them.

2358
03:57:18,000 --> 03:57:20,000
And it's like, OK, like.

2359
03:57:20,000 --> 03:57:25,000
It is possible for this on one map to be many, many mechanics stacked to the point of craziness.

2360
03:57:25,000 --> 03:57:28,000
So it sounds like the juicing is definitely there.

2361
03:57:28,000 --> 03:57:30,000
Well, yeah, I mean, that's important, right?

2362
03:57:30,000 --> 03:57:33,000
I mean, like that's part of the POE experience.

2363
03:57:33,000 --> 03:57:35,000
Yeah, for 100 percent.

2364
03:57:35,000 --> 03:57:42,000
But how much control do you have as a player though over min-maxing your just exploration of the Atlas map?

2365
03:57:42,000 --> 03:57:43,000
So effectively.

2366
03:57:43,000 --> 03:57:45,000
Can you do better in some way?

2367
03:57:45,000 --> 03:57:49,000
So effectively what you're going to want to do is the towers are where you go to like see areas around.

2368
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:53,000
And then the structure of the connections is quite open.

2369
03:57:53,000 --> 03:57:55,000
So like you can be lined for things pretty well.

2370
03:57:55,000 --> 03:57:59,000
Like if you like you can certainly see a lot more maps than what you play, if you know what I mean.

2371
03:57:59,000 --> 03:58:00,000
Yeah.

2372
03:58:00,000 --> 03:58:05,000
So because of that, like, you know, choosing what you want is easy to do.

2373
03:58:05,000 --> 03:58:07,000
And you can kind of see the towers in the fog.

2374
03:58:07,000 --> 03:58:12,000
Yes, you can see the towers in the fog from a distance, which means that, you know, like a lot of the time it's like, you know, go to a tower.

2375
03:58:12,000 --> 03:58:13,000
You'll see some maps you want to play.

2376
03:58:13,000 --> 03:58:14,000
You go play those.

2377
03:58:14,000 --> 03:58:16,000
Then it's like the next tower is just a few other maps away.

2378
03:58:16,000 --> 03:58:17,000
Go to that tower.

2379
03:58:17,000 --> 03:58:18,000
See the next area and so on.

2380
03:58:18,000 --> 03:58:20,000
I'm guessing that's like a certain range that you can see.

2381
03:58:20,000 --> 03:58:27,000
Yeah, the fog kind of in 3D kind of the fog is actually a 3D thing and like it like rises slowly as he gets away from where they are.

2382
03:58:27,000 --> 03:58:29,000
So that's how you kind of get the towers.

2383
03:58:29,000 --> 03:58:32,000
So you might see a cluster of towers off somewhere.

2384
03:58:32,000 --> 03:58:33,000
Yeah, absolutely.

2385
03:58:33,000 --> 03:58:39,000
It sounds like this is like potentially an infinitely expanding map that is going to be by the end of someone's league quite big.

2386
03:58:39,000 --> 03:58:40,000
Yes.

2387
03:58:40,000 --> 03:58:42,000
So we actually need to add a search feature.

2388
03:58:42,000 --> 03:58:45,000
I don't know if they've done it yet for finding specific maps that haven't been run yet.

2389
03:58:45,000 --> 03:58:55,000
We have a few things that there's a button you can press and it like goes to your last map round one that goes back to a home base and one that goes to some of the special, you know, more iconic things you find.

2390
03:58:55,000 --> 03:58:57,000
But this we certainly need more.

2391
03:58:57,000 --> 03:59:00,000
100%.

2392
03:59:00,000 --> 03:59:02,000
So that is something we will be working on.

2393
03:59:02,000 --> 03:59:03,000
Hopefully it's there.

2394
03:59:03,000 --> 03:59:05,000
Who knows?

2395
03:59:05,000 --> 03:59:11,000
And so way stones have a tier, but they don't have specific maps on them anymore, which obviously shrinks that whole map pull thing down.

2396
03:59:11,000 --> 03:59:13,000
Yes, substantially.

2397
03:59:13,000 --> 03:59:17,000
It'll make the maps dash tab a little easier to manage.

2398
03:59:17,000 --> 03:59:25,000
So, yeah, so have you thought about like what sort of economic consequences that have for like how players progress through maps?

2399
03:59:25,000 --> 03:59:30,000
Is it easier to do when you don't have to collect all of these individual maps to get the completion bonuses and stuff like we do currently?

2400
03:59:30,000 --> 03:59:34,000
Like we have that whole, you know, hunting down over 100 maps to get completion for.

2401
03:59:34,000 --> 03:59:46,000
I mean, yeah, now you're hunting, you know, you're hunting certain valuable maps, you're hunting towers, you're hunting content, you're hunting, you know, the warlord, the faction leaders to get the pinnacle.

2402
03:59:46,000 --> 03:59:50,000
You know, you're hunting unique maps, very different thing for sure.

2403
03:59:50,000 --> 03:59:54,000
As opposed to and then the item is all about, I've just got a key.

2404
03:59:54,000 --> 03:59:58,000
I just want good modifiers, you know, there's not really all that whole other variable to it.

2405
03:59:59,000 --> 04:00:05,000
So there's still a lot of lot of interesting choice and axes, but we've taken it from the item and put it on the actual world map.

2406
04:00:05,000 --> 04:00:12,000
But it's cool. It also makes you just feel like you're traversing a world, you know, you're not instantly like finishing the campaign very grounded.

2407
04:00:12,000 --> 04:00:17,000
And now I'm in space, you know, like I only literally just thought about that.

2408
04:00:17,000 --> 04:00:23,000
I was going to ask about that. So, you know, the mapping system was always this like extra dimensional kind of unknown thing.

2409
04:00:23,000 --> 04:00:25,000
It's pretty interesting, but it is a little weird.

2410
04:00:25,000 --> 04:00:30,000
So we wanted to start with actually like at least I mean, look, I'm sure we'll get to the extra dimensional beings eventually.

2411
04:00:30,000 --> 04:00:35,000
But at least to start with, you know, we want to have a bit more grounded initially.

2412
04:00:35,000 --> 04:00:37,000
Yes, you're on the planet.

2413
04:00:37,000 --> 04:00:39,000
You're on the planet.

2414
04:00:39,000 --> 04:00:41,000
That's like a good thing.

2415
04:00:41,000 --> 04:00:43,000
We've become a sci-fi crazy.

2416
04:00:43,000 --> 04:00:46,000
But yeah, you know, you haven't gone to the moon yet.

2417
04:00:46,000 --> 04:00:47,000
Yes, I'll get.

2418
04:00:47,000 --> 04:00:52,000
Well, even then we were saying like, can we at least at least before we go to outer space, go to the moon first?

2419
04:00:52,000 --> 04:00:55,000
Actually, how many moons are we don't know?

2420
04:00:55,000 --> 04:00:59,000
There's a whole complicated thing we need to figure out there.

2421
04:00:59,000 --> 04:01:04,000
I feel like there's a delve, but up league coming.

2422
04:01:04,000 --> 04:01:06,000
All right.

2423
04:01:06,000 --> 04:01:08,000
So we've got this one in four maps is boss maps.

2424
04:01:08,000 --> 04:01:11,000
And then that means the other three are not boss maps.

2425
04:01:11,000 --> 04:01:13,000
Yes. What does a non boss map look like?

2426
04:01:13,000 --> 04:01:14,000
How do you win it?

2427
04:01:14,000 --> 04:01:20,000
So effectively, what you need to do is kill the kill the rares in the map to remove the corruption and finish it.

2428
04:01:20,000 --> 04:01:24,000
Once you get down below 50 monsters, it will point out any rares that are remaining.

2429
04:01:24,000 --> 04:01:26,000
They're going to market just so you know.

2430
04:01:26,000 --> 04:01:36,000
But honestly, I wouldn't expect that to even be necessary most of the time because the layouts are kind of designed so that, you know, like, you know, if you generally speaking, you want to clear the maps to find the rares anyway, because those are the one, you know, those have good drops.

2431
04:01:36,000 --> 04:01:44,000
And effectively, the only reason that you would need that market thing is just occasionally get some slightly weird, generic layout where there's some side but you didn't notice or something like that.

2432
04:01:44,000 --> 04:01:46,000
And that's like that's where you have to go.

2433
04:01:46,000 --> 04:01:48,000
So generally speaking, you'll be able to make your way around and kill them all.

2434
04:01:48,000 --> 04:01:51,000
The goal of the player is you're cleansing corruption from the world.

2435
04:01:51,000 --> 04:01:54,000
You'll bring the order back, you know, stuff like that.

2436
04:01:54,000 --> 04:02:06,000
So you even get the thing on the map where you're like, you know, there's some corruption looking stuff around the map when you complete the map that gets purged away, you know, so you feel like you're reverse painting the map a little bit.

2437
04:02:06,000 --> 04:02:11,000
Cleaning up to it can actually be quite satisfying as you're like changing all the nodes from one color to another.

2438
04:02:11,000 --> 04:02:12,000
And you're like, yeah, this is fun.

2439
04:02:13,000 --> 04:02:18,000
Ultimately, what we wanted to do is we wanted boss combat in POE 2 to matter when we have it.

2440
04:02:18,000 --> 04:02:28,000
Yeah. And so in order, like if you have a map boss every area, then if we made it so the boss combat mattered enough, like in order to actually balance it that way, it's too much.

2441
04:02:28,000 --> 04:02:32,000
Like it actually is like, you know, you spend too much of your time fighting bosses.

2442
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:36,000
So effectively, if that's what you want to do now, you can do it because there's bosses there.

2443
04:02:36,000 --> 04:02:39,000
You know, like when I say one of four maps is a map boss, that doesn't mean that one for maps you play as one.

2444
04:02:39,000 --> 04:02:42,000
Because, you know, obviously you can pick what content you're doing by exploring around.

2445
04:02:42,000 --> 04:02:43,000
You can chain your boss.

2446
04:02:43,000 --> 04:02:44,000
You're picking your path and your path.

2447
04:02:44,000 --> 04:02:47,000
Exactly. So effectively, if you want to hunt the bosses, then that is the thing you can do.

2448
04:02:47,000 --> 04:02:51,000
If you want to just like do some mindless grinding for a while, you can do that too.

2449
04:02:51,000 --> 04:02:54,000
And what it means is we can actually make the bosses way more rewarding.

2450
04:02:54,000 --> 04:02:58,000
They can drop way more items than they were going to because of the fact that there's not one at the end of every area, right?

2451
04:02:58,000 --> 04:03:01,000
And the fight is substantial, you get a lot of drops.

2452
04:03:01,000 --> 04:03:03,000
So that actually is something that...

2453
04:03:03,000 --> 04:03:04,000
And they get their own tree.

2454
04:03:04,000 --> 04:03:07,000
And they...what? Oh yeah, I know, right. You mean the boss killing tree.

2455
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:09,000
The boss killing tree. Yes, there's a tree for boss hunting.

2456
04:03:09,000 --> 04:03:11,000
Sorry, I thought you meant every boss had its own tree.

2457
04:03:11,000 --> 04:03:13,000
I was like, Jesus, did you do some design well?

2458
04:03:13,000 --> 04:03:15,000
Not yet. Not yet.

2459
04:03:15,000 --> 04:03:17,000
So I was just like, wait, no, wait, stop.

2460
04:03:17,000 --> 04:03:18,000
It's too much.

2461
04:03:18,000 --> 04:03:20,000
That's like a year three feature.

2462
04:03:20,000 --> 04:03:21,000
Yeah, okay.

2463
04:03:21,000 --> 04:03:23,000
Okay, we'll keep that in mind.

2464
04:03:23,000 --> 04:03:27,000
Yeah, so there's actually like a...I do love that there's a boss hunting because I'm super into that.

2465
04:03:27,000 --> 04:03:29,000
There's a boss hunting tree that you can fill out as well.

2466
04:03:29,000 --> 04:03:31,000
So how do you get points on that?

2467
04:03:31,000 --> 04:03:34,000
Yeah, so effectively, I mean, well...

2468
04:03:34,000 --> 04:03:35,000
You get a lot of points for the core tree.

2469
04:03:35,000 --> 04:03:37,000
There's a core tree that affects all mapping.

2470
04:03:37,000 --> 04:03:44,000
All of things like pack size, quant rarity, and you've got multiple keystones that all can work together and all can...

2471
04:03:44,000 --> 04:03:46,000
So I think there's three of them.

2472
04:03:46,000 --> 04:03:48,000
One plays on like corrupted maps.

2473
04:03:48,000 --> 04:03:50,000
One plays on like prefixes and suffixes.

2474
04:03:50,000 --> 04:03:54,000
And I can't remember what the other one does right in this very moment.

2475
04:03:54,000 --> 04:04:02,000
But you obviously get that core tree and then you have a boss tree and then obviously all the different league and pinnacle content trees.

2476
04:04:02,000 --> 04:04:06,000
So you get those points by just completing maps.

2477
04:04:06,000 --> 04:04:08,000
It just has a...you effectively get a quest.

2478
04:04:08,000 --> 04:04:16,000
And effectively, it's like you complete ten maps, you get your first two points, and then like complete X maps and Y maps.

2479
04:04:16,000 --> 04:04:18,000
But of certain tiers.

2480
04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:21,000
At least tier one, at least tier two, at least tier three.

2481
04:04:21,000 --> 04:04:27,000
So this is the tier climb effectively, where it's like as you get up the higher tiers and clear maps of certain tiers, that's when you start getting points for the atlas.

2482
04:04:27,000 --> 04:04:34,000
And like, may I say the third one, I can't remember the exact specifics, it's like complete this and defeat a boss.

2483
04:04:34,000 --> 04:04:37,000
And then later it's defeat at least five bosses at something.

2484
04:04:37,000 --> 04:04:39,000
So killing bosses generates...

2485
04:04:39,000 --> 04:04:40,000
It sounds way better for fresh starts.

2486
04:04:40,000 --> 04:04:42,000
I'm not having to go and get that STO map that I missed or something.

2487
04:04:42,000 --> 04:04:44,000
Yeah, oh yeah, for sure.

2488
04:04:44,000 --> 04:04:45,000
I'm just doing content.

2489
04:04:45,000 --> 04:04:50,000
But it is kind of the analogue of that in a way, because it's that feeling of like I've got a system to progress through.

2490
04:04:50,000 --> 04:04:52,000
Like I just need to beat these objectives.

2491
04:04:52,000 --> 04:04:53,000
Definitely got a lot of progression.

2492
04:04:53,000 --> 04:04:58,000
And from that you're getting the atlas passive points and so on.

2493
04:04:58,000 --> 04:04:59,000
So yeah, that's kind of the idea.

2494
04:04:59,000 --> 04:05:06,000
Yeah, so you can really like focus in on map blasting with bossless maps or on bossing content if you want to.

2495
04:05:06,000 --> 04:05:08,000
Or on breaches.

2496
04:05:08,000 --> 04:05:11,000
And you can always put a breach on a map with a boss, right?

2497
04:05:11,000 --> 04:05:12,000
You can do both.

2498
04:05:12,000 --> 04:05:15,000
You can have every type of content on one map if you want.

2499
04:05:16,000 --> 04:05:24,000
Yeah, is like a boss map a kind of like a distinct thing from like a regular map in terms of like the layout or the thing you've done?

2500
04:05:24,000 --> 04:05:28,000
Technically they are separate, but generally speaking...

2501
04:05:28,000 --> 04:05:30,000
They're like similar versions of each.

2502
04:05:30,000 --> 04:05:31,000
They're basically the same.

2503
04:05:31,000 --> 04:05:32,000
They're pretty similar.

2504
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:34,000
So they'll be like a boss as during and a non-boss as during.

2505
04:05:34,000 --> 04:05:38,000
Yeah, there are some cases at the moment where there are some maps that can't have a boss.

2506
04:05:38,000 --> 04:05:40,000
And it's just we haven't done the...

2507
04:05:40,000 --> 04:05:43,000
The one that would go here is not in early access yet and that kind of thing.

2508
04:05:43,000 --> 04:05:48,000
But effectively, you know, as I said, generally speaking, it'll be one in four that you'll find.

2509
04:05:48,000 --> 04:05:50,000
Okay, excellent.

2510
04:05:50,000 --> 04:05:53,000
So I think that covers...

2511
04:05:53,000 --> 04:05:55,000
Did I miss some things from...

2512
04:05:55,000 --> 04:06:00,000
You've got like all the smaller contents like the strong boxes and essences and things like that coming back as well.

2513
04:06:00,000 --> 04:06:02,000
Yeah, so initially we actually had a design where everything...

2514
04:06:02,000 --> 04:06:05,000
Like even all the smaller content, there were still going to be icons for it on the tree.

2515
04:06:05,000 --> 04:06:06,000
Sorry, on the atlas.

2516
04:06:06,000 --> 04:06:09,000
But we actually found that it meant that when you were actually exploring, it didn't kind of...

2517
04:06:09,000 --> 04:06:11,000
It felt like there was nothing random to find.

2518
04:06:11,000 --> 04:06:17,000
So we wanted to make sure we also have kind of just completely random stuff that doesn't have a progression system that you just run into randomly, because that's fun too.

2519
04:06:17,000 --> 04:06:19,000
And we'll probably be adding more stuff like that as well over time.

2520
04:06:19,000 --> 04:06:20,000
There's just like just the...

2521
04:06:20,000 --> 04:06:23,000
You randomly encountered this and that was like not expected.

2522
04:06:23,000 --> 04:06:25,000
So that's a lot of stuff on the core atlas tree.

2523
04:06:25,000 --> 04:06:28,000
So you can kind of like see more of that if you want to.

2524
04:06:28,000 --> 04:06:29,000
Yep. Great.

2525
04:06:29,000 --> 04:06:32,000
And often mods on the items as well.

2526
04:06:32,000 --> 04:06:34,000
On map. On keep waystones.

2527
04:06:34,000 --> 04:06:35,000
Yeah, cool. Yep.

2528
04:06:35,000 --> 04:06:38,000
Lots of different names. Maps, waystones, same thing.

2529
04:06:39,000 --> 04:06:42,000
Yes, I've had to keep kind of correcting myself about that.

2530
04:06:42,000 --> 04:06:44,000
I was like, I don't know.

2531
04:06:44,000 --> 04:06:47,000
Internally, we definitely call them maps all the time.

2532
04:06:47,000 --> 04:06:54,000
The thing is, the only reason why it doesn't make sense thematically is because a map does imply it's of a specific location, whereas a waystone can take you to anywhere.

2533
04:06:54,000 --> 04:06:56,000
So that's the reason why the name change had to happen.

2534
04:06:56,000 --> 04:06:59,000
But I think that probably even players will probably just call them maps I bet.

2535
04:06:59,000 --> 04:07:02,000
Just because, you know, if it's the peer we want to mention.

2536
04:07:03,000 --> 04:07:10,000
So we've got the Breach, Delirium, Ritual, Expedition, those like leagues that maybe need a new name.

2537
04:07:10,000 --> 04:07:15,000
Is there another one that you're just both personally really keen to bring back in the future?

2538
04:07:15,000 --> 04:07:20,000
I mean, you know, like I've always wanted to have Delve again, but I kind of got a bit of that wish with the system.

2539
04:07:20,000 --> 04:07:27,000
It's also a very like content heavy league to make because you need to make tons of encounters and doing it probably is a huge thing.

2540
04:07:27,000 --> 04:07:30,000
But I mean, look, I love Incursion as well. It's one of my favorites.

2541
04:07:30,000 --> 04:07:33,000
Like I'm keen for that. I don't know if there's anything you other than that you're really keen for.

2542
04:07:33,000 --> 04:07:39,000
There's a lot, especially because there's a lot I can do with we can do with all this new art, new monsters, new monsters, right?

2543
04:07:39,000 --> 04:07:43,000
Like, for example, if you just take Legion, Legion had all those five civilizations.

2544
04:07:43,000 --> 04:07:49,000
We've now got an entire new array of vile monsters, vile bosses, etc. that we can use as a baseline.

2545
04:07:49,000 --> 04:07:54,000
We've got way better consistent direction on what's going on there.

2546
04:07:54,000 --> 04:07:58,000
You know, heaps of stuff, new animation and the capacities are just out of control.

2547
04:07:59,000 --> 04:08:09,000
But then you've got OK, Incursion, we've got, you know, awesome vile artwork we can use there and make that all awesome and nice new corruption mechanics that we can extrapolate on.

2548
04:08:09,000 --> 04:08:11,000
Don't have a roof as the boss anymore.

2549
04:08:11,000 --> 04:08:14,000
Now you're not just have a floating roof.

2550
04:08:14,000 --> 04:08:18,000
The only text is just a small floating roof.

2551
04:08:18,000 --> 04:08:21,000
Keeping the theme of vacuum cleaners.

2552
04:08:21,000 --> 04:08:24,000
Look, mistakes were made.

2553
04:08:24,000 --> 04:08:29,000
Now we have minimum, that's a world where you had super uniques with one or two skills.

2554
04:08:29,000 --> 04:08:30,000
Right.

2555
04:08:30,000 --> 04:08:33,000
I don't, there's only so much you can do with a floating roof.

2556
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:42,000
So anyway, and then, I don't know, even like bestiary coming back with something because we've got all these awesome bosses way grander in scale.

2557
04:08:42,000 --> 04:08:49,000
And you can do these more grand hunts for them as opposed to just like, oh, I'm like in a city and there's a rare spider, you know.

2558
04:08:49,000 --> 04:08:56,000
You can just get way, way more epic and way more, you know, involved and with all the new art and so much stuff to like.

2559
04:08:56,000 --> 04:09:01,000
Bestiary 2 that's like hunting big beasts and preparing for them and tracking them.

2560
04:09:01,000 --> 04:09:03,000
That'd be pretty cool.

2561
04:09:03,000 --> 04:09:04,000
Exactly.

2562
04:09:04,000 --> 04:09:07,000
I'd definitely take some mercenary action to that.

2563
04:09:07,000 --> 04:09:09,000
That'd be a good fit, I feel.

2564
04:09:09,000 --> 04:09:10,000
All right.

2565
04:09:10,000 --> 04:09:12,000
Well, there's lots for us to look forward to there.

2566
04:09:12,000 --> 04:09:15,000
You have some kind of like penned already for adding to the beta.

2567
04:09:15,000 --> 04:09:18,000
I mean, we all plans can change, but they're absolutely.

2568
04:09:18,000 --> 04:09:22,000
I mean, look, we've done things like commissioning art assets and so on.

2569
04:09:22,000 --> 04:09:24,000
Like we've got stuff coming along.

2570
04:09:24,000 --> 04:09:27,000
It's just a question of like, you know, when we actually get there, what's it going to look like?

2571
04:09:27,000 --> 04:09:28,000
Yeah.

2572
04:09:28,000 --> 04:09:29,000
All right.

2573
04:09:29,000 --> 04:09:35,000
Let's talk about crafting a little bit because we've done a lot there and it's pretty fundamental to the game, I think.

2574
04:09:35,000 --> 04:09:40,000
So what's the core of what you're trying to do with crafting in Path of Exile 2 compared to Path of Exile 1?

2575
04:09:40,000 --> 04:09:47,000
Kind of noting that you've really kind of stepped back from the idea of like reforging an item many times or scouring it.

2576
04:09:47,000 --> 04:09:51,000
So we really want to make it so that you're finding crafting items all the time.

2577
04:09:51,000 --> 04:09:54,000
You're using those crafting items way more often than you were in Path of Exile 1.

2578
04:09:54,000 --> 04:10:00,000
That, you know, just the game of like picking something up, like seeing what I could modify it to,

2579
04:10:00,000 --> 04:10:02,000
and then actually equipping those items just happening way more often.

2580
04:10:02,000 --> 04:10:09,000
And there's so many subtle changes around this, like in terms of just like the way that the base mod scale and items

2581
04:10:09,000 --> 04:10:14,000
and the things like that, like all the stuff to kind of make it so that as you find new base types and new things,

2582
04:10:14,000 --> 04:10:19,000
like you've got a reason to craft them, part of that is making sure that you've got enough of that currency.

2583
04:10:19,000 --> 04:10:25,000
You know, it actually took us a long time to even get comfortable with the idea of making something like an exalt drop that often.

2584
04:10:25,000 --> 04:10:30,000
Because there's just this thing in your cemented in your mind of like, you know, this is rare, right?

2585
04:10:30,000 --> 04:10:34,000
Like it's an exalt, how can it possibly drop like multiple times in that one?

2586
04:10:34,000 --> 04:10:37,000
You know, like it just seems crazy.

2587
04:10:37,000 --> 04:10:43,000
But with the way like removing scouring affected so much of the way that we craft.

2588
04:10:43,000 --> 04:10:49,000
Like I know that you noted earlier that there's so many more things you're allowed to craft now that you weren't allowed to before.

2589
04:10:49,000 --> 04:10:50,000
You can craft relics.

2590
04:10:50,000 --> 04:10:55,000
Yes, and the reason why that's allowed is because without scouring, like those crafts become one time things,

2591
04:10:55,000 --> 04:10:57,000
which means that it's actually okay to allow for that stuff.

2592
04:10:57,000 --> 04:10:59,000
And I think that's opened up a huge amount of stuff.

2593
04:10:59,000 --> 04:11:01,000
You know, there's just, yeah, there's so many more types that can be crafted.

2594
04:11:01,000 --> 04:11:04,000
And add so much more valuable value to the dropped item as well.

2595
04:11:04,000 --> 04:11:05,000
Exactly, exactly.

2596
04:11:05,000 --> 04:11:08,000
So that stuff is just, I think, opened up a huge amount there.

2597
04:11:08,000 --> 04:11:13,000
And it also has and this wasn't necessarily an explicit goal right at the beginning,

2598
04:11:13,000 --> 04:11:21,000
but it's also made that the game of like, I'm just going to click, click, click, click, click again and again as my crafting session is no longer really the matter.

2599
04:11:21,000 --> 04:11:22,000
It's a spam roll.

2600
04:11:22,000 --> 04:11:25,000
Yeah, exactly. Like everything kind of is something that you want to be able to use.

2601
04:11:25,000 --> 04:11:28,000
You are still reforging and meta crafting things.

2602
04:11:28,000 --> 04:11:29,000
We've got stuff like that, right?

2603
04:11:29,000 --> 04:11:30,000
You've got a Nulls.

2604
04:11:30,000 --> 04:11:32,000
But that stuff is higher up.

2605
04:11:32,000 --> 04:11:34,000
That's kind of more of a later game thing.

2606
04:11:34,000 --> 04:11:35,000
It's not spam.

2607
04:11:35,000 --> 04:11:36,000
Yeah, exactly.

2608
04:11:36,000 --> 04:11:38,000
Because you have to think about it after each time.

2609
04:11:38,000 --> 04:11:40,000
Like, will I improve this? Will I make it worse?

2610
04:11:40,000 --> 04:11:42,000
So yeah, there's stuff to do there.

2611
04:11:42,000 --> 04:11:46,000
And like, you know, like the meta crafting that Omens can do is also very interesting.

2612
04:11:46,000 --> 04:11:47,000
Like there's some pretty powerful stuff there.

2613
04:11:47,000 --> 04:11:49,000
But once again, we introduce that stuff later on.

2614
04:11:49,000 --> 04:11:54,000
And so effectively we want to, you know, I guess for lack of a better word, democratize crafting at early levels.

2615
04:11:54,000 --> 04:11:59,000
Like make sure that everyone's able to do that stuff while having the more advanced stuff be kind of a little bit later.

2616
04:11:59,000 --> 04:12:03,000
We certainly had a goal at one point where I was talking with Rishi and I'm like,

2617
04:12:03,000 --> 04:12:07,000
if every single time we're doing alpha wipes or getting the staff to play,

2618
04:12:07,000 --> 04:12:12,000
I am like, if I am not seeing and hearing about people using Exults during Act 1,

2619
04:12:12,000 --> 04:12:15,000
then we have failed and we need to drop more of them.

2620
04:12:15,000 --> 04:12:18,000
And so we ended up like, I would say honestly, in the last month,

2621
04:12:18,000 --> 04:12:22,000
we have like over like 8 to 10 times the amount of currency dropping, you know,

2622
04:12:22,000 --> 04:12:29,000
and you know, there's the cool things about it as well, which are the subtle things like a boss is way more likely to drop the higher tier currencies and stuff.

2623
04:12:29,000 --> 04:12:31,000
Because again, rarity affects that as well now.

2624
04:12:31,000 --> 04:12:35,000
So you're like way more incentivized to go and kill bosses to get them.

2625
04:12:35,000 --> 04:12:37,000
And there's heaps of awesome stuff around there.

2626
04:12:37,000 --> 04:12:44,000
But we're actually now finding people are exalting gear during the campaign, throwing it on weapons and building weapons from scratch.

2627
04:12:44,000 --> 04:12:50,000
You find a very good transmute, org, regal, exalt, exalt, you know, that process is like.

2628
04:12:50,000 --> 04:12:55,000
Transmute, org, regal, exalt is like a thing that you're doing often.

2629
04:12:55,000 --> 04:12:58,000
Yeah. And like enjoy and you know, like you find good bases and you do stuff with that.

2630
04:12:58,000 --> 04:12:59,000
I can speak to that experience.

2631
04:12:59,000 --> 04:13:05,000
So I've played probably six-ish hours most of the way through Act 2 on my mercenary and I've found maybe six or seven exalts.

2632
04:13:05,000 --> 04:13:10,000
I took a ring from like a one blue stat ring that had a nice roll, maybe a nice life roll or something,

2633
04:13:10,000 --> 04:13:12,000
and crafted it up to six property rare.

2634
04:13:12,000 --> 04:13:17,000
And I crafted a crossbow that I found with good sockets that had a good damage roll on it.

2635
04:13:17,000 --> 04:13:20,000
And I took that to six properties with multiple damage mods.

2636
04:13:20,000 --> 04:13:25,000
And I'm like each time that power is going up and I was I was I was doing that.

2637
04:13:25,000 --> 04:13:30,000
It feels good. I felt like the bottom line was regals, which was actually kind of interesting because I don't know if that's intentional.

2638
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:37,000
Just luck, because I did really have to think about which blue items were good enough to take to a rare so that I could then put my exalts on them.

2639
04:13:37,000 --> 04:13:39,000
So you get more of those by disenchanting rares.

2640
04:13:39,000 --> 04:13:44,000
Yeah, they are farmable. So they are farmable, which is completely intentional.

2641
04:13:44,000 --> 04:13:54,000
We want to make sure that like if you don't have enough of those like so you get so generally speaking, it's like you're going to want to keep like I feel like once you get like more than like five or six transmutes, then you stop disenchanting blues and start selling them instead.

2642
04:13:54,000 --> 04:14:02,000
And the same thing could be true also for for regals, where it's like, OK, once you've got more than a certain amount, then you're like, OK, I can stop having to disenchant the stuff and kind of switch over.

2643
04:14:02,000 --> 04:14:06,000
But the nice thing is, is like when you don't have enough, there is a way to get them, which I think is really important.

2644
04:14:06,000 --> 04:14:10,000
And the same is true with the socket currency as well, where it's like, you know, when you don't have enough, you can start salvaging.

2645
04:14:10,000 --> 04:14:14,000
I know you were telling me you were buying stuff from the vendor with sockets in order to salvage it.

2646
04:14:14,000 --> 04:14:16,000
I surprised them with my methods.

2647
04:14:16,000 --> 04:14:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

2648
04:14:18,000 --> 04:14:26,000
So that stuff, you know, it's just really nice to have that for people to have the ability to, you know, to get that stuff when they need it.

2649
04:14:26,000 --> 04:14:32,000
And so it's nice that like all that really basic stuff of just like getting items to better tiers is now way easier to get.

2650
04:14:32,000 --> 04:14:38,000
And that solved a problem that we had through quite a lot of the betas where people were saying they didn't feel they had enough control.

2651
04:14:38,000 --> 04:14:44,000
Like they didn't feel like they had a way to advance their character when they needed to, to be able to solve specific problems.

2652
04:14:44,000 --> 04:14:52,000
And I think the socket thing really has helped a lot with that now, because now we've have a way finally to be like, OK, if I need a bunch of fire resist, there is a way to get that.

2653
04:14:52,000 --> 04:14:54,000
And I've got the tools to do it and I've got items I can use to do this stuff.

2654
04:14:54,000 --> 04:15:01,000
So that has helped a huge amount, I think, of solving those like, you know, issues that come up with your character.

2655
04:15:01,000 --> 04:15:04,000
And this is to confirm how you've solved BenchCrafting.

2656
04:15:04,000 --> 04:15:05,000
Exactly.

2657
04:15:05,000 --> 04:15:08,000
We went through so many iterations of bench stuff.

2658
04:15:08,000 --> 04:15:09,000
It was like a huge thing.

2659
04:15:09,000 --> 04:15:13,000
We implemented tons of UI, like there was tons of wasted time there implementing crafting.

2660
04:15:13,000 --> 04:15:19,000
The problem that we had was that the systems that we were making, it's like we could balance them in the ways the players were happy with.

2661
04:15:19,000 --> 04:15:24,000
And then the designers were very unhappy or we could balance them the way the designers are happy with and the players are unhappy.

2662
04:15:24,000 --> 04:15:29,000
And it's like when you've got a system where like you're fighting the players for what, how the balance should be.

2663
04:15:29,000 --> 04:15:32,000
You can tell that means you have a system that is bad.

2664
04:15:32,000 --> 04:15:38,000
But I think we were very, like I myself honestly was too slow to recognize the fact that a complete overhaul was needed.

2665
04:15:38,000 --> 04:15:44,000
And then at some point we actually, the socket stuff originally came from the Vaal Orb, like it was designed there.

2666
04:15:44,000 --> 04:15:49,000
And then at some point, I don't know who came up with it, I think it might have just been you, who said like, why don't we just put...

2667
04:15:49,000 --> 04:15:50,000
Nah, I appreciate it.

2668
04:15:50,000 --> 04:15:51,000
Rishi thought of that? Okay, yeah.

2669
04:15:51,000 --> 04:15:56,000
So Rishi thought of the idea of like, hey, what if we just put sockets, you know, in an early game?

2670
04:15:56,000 --> 04:15:57,000
What if you got them in Act 1?

2671
04:15:57,000 --> 04:16:04,000
What if you had runes that would let you get the base as the way of solving the remedial crafting problem?

2672
04:16:04,000 --> 04:16:10,000
So then suddenly, as soon as we do that, it's like, oh, like I'm happy, you know, players are happy, everyone's happy.

2673
04:16:10,000 --> 04:16:15,000
So that means we have a good system that is working and gets those good feelings.

2674
04:16:15,000 --> 04:16:17,000
So that I think was a real win.

2675
04:16:17,000 --> 04:16:21,000
And, you know, yeah, I love how that system is feeling at the moment.

2676
04:16:21,000 --> 04:16:27,000
Yeah, so the bench was achieving two things kind of in its way, which was maybe even three.

2677
04:16:27,000 --> 04:16:31,000
Gear customization for one, like you take an item and you can do something more to it, firstly.

2678
04:16:31,000 --> 04:16:35,000
And then you've got the problem fixing of like, oh, I need a bit more fire resistance.

2679
04:16:35,000 --> 04:16:37,000
And then the third thing was like the meta crafts.

2680
04:16:37,000 --> 04:16:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

2681
04:16:38,000 --> 04:16:40,000
So you've handled those each in different ways.

2682
04:16:40,000 --> 04:16:41,000
Exactly.

2683
04:16:41,000 --> 04:16:44,000
The runes, which do the first two things, the customization and the problem fixing.

2684
04:16:44,000 --> 04:16:45,000
So early on...

2685
04:16:45,000 --> 04:16:50,000
But I think the customization is even it's the soul cores.

2686
04:16:50,000 --> 04:16:53,000
Like the runes are more about the kind of like, I need to fix resistances.

2687
04:16:53,000 --> 04:16:59,000
Whereas the soul cores are more about like, I want to customize my items in different ways than what I would otherwise normally be able to do.

2688
04:16:59,000 --> 04:17:02,000
And then, of course, you've got the omens to solve the meta crafting problem.

2689
04:17:02,000 --> 04:17:03,000
So effectively, we move stuff around.

2690
04:17:03,000 --> 04:17:04,000
And essences as well.

2691
04:17:04,000 --> 04:17:05,000
Yes, of course.

2692
04:17:05,000 --> 04:17:09,000
So, yeah, essences, what they allow you to do is get two deterministic mods.

2693
04:17:09,000 --> 04:17:11,000
So because you can upgrade to blue and the...

2694
04:17:11,000 --> 04:17:16,000
But you can also upgrade from blue to rare with an essence as well.

2695
04:17:16,000 --> 04:17:17,000
So that lets you kind of get some of that stuff.

2696
04:17:17,000 --> 04:17:19,000
And then plus some of the omen things you can...

2697
04:17:19,000 --> 04:17:23,000
Yeah, there's stuff you can do there that is, I think, going to be pretty interesting.

2698
04:17:23,000 --> 04:17:25,000
And that's just at the start of release.

2699
04:17:25,000 --> 04:17:29,000
Yeah, because obviously there's going to be more, of course, as we add more things.

2700
04:17:29,000 --> 04:17:31,000
So, yeah.

2701
04:17:31,000 --> 04:17:38,000
So I was like, I was worried that, you know, some of the changes you're making might move us away from some of the like deep impact for crafting that we have.

2702
04:17:38,000 --> 04:17:45,000
But it sounds like you are still allowing like powerful meta crafting and the ability to make like a really good item.

2703
04:17:45,000 --> 04:17:46,000
For sure.

2704
04:17:46,000 --> 04:17:51,000
But you're also making sure that like the physical item itself that you find matters more.

2705
04:17:51,000 --> 04:17:52,000
Absolutely.

2706
04:17:52,000 --> 04:17:54,000
And I mean, like the more subtle...

2707
04:17:54,000 --> 04:17:55,000
That's what it's all about, right?

2708
04:17:55,000 --> 04:18:00,000
There's so much more going on, I think, just like clever things we've done with the item system as well.

2709
04:18:00,000 --> 04:18:04,000
Like one of the things I love that we did is we've made it so that...

2710
04:18:04,000 --> 04:18:07,000
So we've got blue and yellow chests you can find now.

2711
04:18:07,000 --> 04:18:15,000
And we've changed the world generation so that if a dead end is generated, the chance that you get a rare chest there is way higher.

2712
04:18:15,000 --> 04:18:19,000
So effectively, if a rare chest will spawn in the area, then it will choose dead ends first to go there.

2713
04:18:19,000 --> 04:18:20,000
We feel better about that.

2714
04:18:20,000 --> 04:18:28,000
Yeah, so that means that we effectively mean that like when like it makes the world feel like, you know, as far as item drops go, they're like, oh, like it feels intentional, right?

2715
04:18:28,000 --> 04:18:31,000
Like, oh, I went down into this dead end room, but look, there was a rare chest there.

2716
04:18:31,000 --> 04:18:32,000
So I feel happy about it.

2717
04:18:32,000 --> 04:18:34,000
You know, like that kind of thing is really cool.

2718
04:18:34,000 --> 04:18:36,000
So there's things like that.

2719
04:18:36,000 --> 04:18:48,000
But there's also the way that, yeah, so we've alluded to it a few times, but the way that rarity now works, where the mods get better as rarity increases, and also things like the you get better currency rather than just...

2720
04:18:48,000 --> 04:18:49,000
Yeah.

2721
04:18:49,000 --> 04:18:51,000
It means we don't have to have like the spam of items that's like crazy.

2722
04:18:51,000 --> 04:18:59,000
Like you actually feel like the that you kill a boss and it drops good shit as opposed to just lots of shit.

2723
04:18:59,000 --> 04:19:03,000
So, you know, that's the that's that's that's I'm a big fan of how this feels.

2724
04:19:03,000 --> 04:19:04,000
I think it's a lot better.

2725
04:19:04,000 --> 04:19:19,000
But it does mean though, of course, if you're a P1 player and you see a boss kill, like the number of like the expectation of like a P1 player sees like looks at the amount of spam on the screen in some to some level as the way of like knowing how good the drops were.

2726
04:19:19,000 --> 04:19:20,000
Now, of course, you got item filters and everything.

2727
04:19:20,000 --> 04:19:21,000
We have quantity brain, right?

2728
04:19:21,000 --> 04:19:23,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

2729
04:19:23,000 --> 04:19:24,000
Yeah, exactly.

2730
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:26,000
That is a good way of putting it.

2731
04:19:26,000 --> 04:19:29,000
So, yeah, it really is more about like, is the is are the items actually good?

2732
04:19:29,000 --> 04:19:35,000
Like, ideally, you kill a boss and you pick every item that drops up, you know, like that is a that to me is a win.

2733
04:19:35,000 --> 04:19:39,000
And I think we've we're basically getting at that point.

2734
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:50,000
Yeah, I quite like how the exploration systems and that as well with the chess down dead ends and things like that acts as a player leveler in some ways.

2735
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:53,000
We're like, yeah, the more you explore, the more stuff you find.

2736
04:19:53,000 --> 04:19:56,000
And that's true as well for the optional encounters around the place as well.

2737
04:19:56,000 --> 04:20:06,000
If you're if you're struggling, go fight some optional content, there'll be stuff there that can that can drop and, you know, that then you will definitely find things and lots of guaranteed rare rare items here and there.

2738
04:20:06,000 --> 04:20:08,000
And I like that.

2739
04:20:08,000 --> 04:20:13,000
This little boss here will drop a cast a rare cast item and heaps of stuff.

2740
04:20:13,000 --> 04:20:22,000
And the funny thing about that is that stuff like the came about a little bit from the fact that we actually had a problem where people were just face tanking bosses and dying over and over again.

2741
04:20:23,000 --> 04:20:28,000
They keep on respawning and they would never be like, oh, I'm going to go away and actually find some of the stuff.

2742
04:20:28,000 --> 04:20:36,000
And so I was thinking for a long time about like, well, why is it that in other games that people don't do that?

2743
04:20:36,000 --> 04:20:41,000
Like if I'm playing Elden Ring and I die to a boss like, you know, 10 times, I'm not just going to like just just continue doing that.

2744
04:20:41,000 --> 04:20:43,000
I'm going to be like, oh, maybe I'll go do something else for a while.

2745
04:20:43,000 --> 04:20:49,000
So we realized that the map like the idea of just there's lots of stuff to find like is actually a really important part of that.

2746
04:20:50,000 --> 04:20:55,000
So in Pewee 2 now, one of the recent things that's taking a lot of work from from people to get this working.

2747
04:20:55,000 --> 04:21:01,000
But now all of that, there's a you can see all the sort of weird side encounters that have specific drops on the map.

2748
04:21:01,000 --> 04:21:04,000
And that means that, you know, if you're if you're having trouble with the boss, you know, you know what?

2749
04:21:04,000 --> 04:21:11,000
I'm just going to go do some other stuff and then you'll come back and you will be powerful enough to kill the boss much more easily because you do absolutely find the rewarding things.

2750
04:21:11,000 --> 04:21:14,000
Yeah, there's a little chest on there or a little campsite.

2751
04:21:14,000 --> 04:21:17,000
Yeah, there's lots of little hard cut of drops from specific bosses.

2752
04:21:17,000 --> 04:21:18,000
They only the hard cut of drops.

2753
04:21:18,000 --> 04:21:19,000
They only drop one time.

2754
04:21:19,000 --> 04:21:20,000
So you can't just find them endlessly.

2755
04:21:20,000 --> 04:21:21,000
Yeah.

2756
04:21:21,000 --> 04:21:25,000
But effectively, if you go do all that side content and you check it all off, you'll get some very rewarding stuff.

2757
04:21:25,000 --> 04:21:27,000
Yeah, you got some pretty clever systems there.

2758
04:21:27,000 --> 04:21:33,000
And I definitely noted that I was using the map thing a lot to be like, oh, well, to be completionist about it.

2759
04:21:33,000 --> 04:21:36,000
But also, yeah, just being aware of like, oh, cool.

2760
04:21:36,000 --> 04:21:38,000
There was some there's some good stuff in this on that I can come and find.

2761
04:21:38,000 --> 04:21:44,000
And I think we figured out that like that some of that stuff reveals after you like find the waypoint in a zone.

2762
04:21:44,000 --> 04:21:45,000
That's how it works.

2763
04:21:45,000 --> 04:21:46,000
Yeah, it's either there's a few.

2764
04:21:46,000 --> 04:21:53,000
It's like either because an NPC told you about an area in which case it just happens to be revealed or the very least.

2765
04:21:53,000 --> 04:21:58,000
Yes. When you get there, generally, it's just when you get there, you see everything.

2766
04:21:58,000 --> 04:22:01,000
But there's a few different conditions that will reveal everything.

2767
04:22:01,000 --> 04:22:02,000
Kind of depends.

2768
04:22:02,000 --> 04:22:05,000
Like a lot of people just click through the dialogue so they'll never know the NPC told them.

2769
04:22:05,000 --> 04:22:10,000
But they check in my map kind of like when I went into a zone and then maybe afterwards to see if there was anything.

2770
04:22:10,000 --> 04:22:19,000
But like you never get to an area and don't see some unless they are like very obviously hidden intentional secrets that there's no they might be there.

2771
04:22:19,000 --> 04:22:22,000
They might not have found half of your key for your secret quest.

2772
04:22:22,000 --> 04:22:26,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't worry about that.

2773
04:22:26,000 --> 04:22:33,000
So pivoting into economy and trading, the exchange from Path of Exile's one experiment recently,

2774
04:22:33,000 --> 04:22:36,000
we got a chance to actually try that live in the field.

2775
04:22:36,000 --> 04:22:39,000
And it seems from the player's perspective, it was a smash hit.

2776
04:22:39,000 --> 04:22:41,000
Definitely for us as well. Yeah, I got solved a lot.

2777
04:22:41,000 --> 04:22:44,000
I'm like we're 100 percent on board with that.

2778
04:22:44,000 --> 04:22:45,000
It's very good.

2779
04:22:45,000 --> 04:22:48,000
It was the least stressful league I ever played.

2780
04:22:48,000 --> 04:22:54,000
I mean, what normally caused almost all the anger and friction for me was was was yes, especially bulk trading.

2781
04:22:54,000 --> 04:22:58,000
It was horrible. And I was like, oh, this is like a dream come true.

2782
04:22:58,000 --> 04:23:01,000
Myself and so many other players, I feel like we're more engaged in endgame.

2783
04:23:01,000 --> 04:23:03,000
We were able to do the thing we wanted to do more.

2784
04:23:03,000 --> 04:23:06,000
And we're just less aggravated moment to moment basis.

2785
04:23:06,000 --> 04:23:13,000
That's good. So do you take that then as like as a big positive for it going into Path of Exile 2?

2786
04:23:13,000 --> 04:23:14,000
100 percent.

2787
04:23:14,000 --> 04:23:17,000
And how do you feel like it adapts to the game being quite different in the end?

2788
04:23:17,000 --> 04:23:18,000
Because they are pretty different games.

2789
04:23:18,000 --> 04:23:20,000
Like the economy works a bit differently.

2790
04:23:20,000 --> 04:23:22,000
I mean, honestly, I think I think it will just work.

2791
04:23:22,000 --> 04:23:26,000
I mean, look, we don't we have no idea what the trade values will settle on and like how that'll end up.

2792
04:23:26,000 --> 04:23:29,000
But yeah, like we're going to be chaos is going to be.

2793
04:23:29,000 --> 04:23:35,000
Yeah, but ultimately, I think that the trades effectively settlers was a test of what the trade

2794
04:23:35,000 --> 04:23:40,000
of what the economy will be like in Pewee 2 and to some extent because of the way that we did the gold and everything.

2795
04:23:40,000 --> 04:23:42,000
Yeah. So I'm pretty confident that that's going to be OK.

2796
04:23:42,000 --> 04:23:43,000
But obviously, you never know. Right.

2797
04:23:43,000 --> 04:23:46,000
Like when lots of people hit the economy, what can happen?

2798
04:23:46,000 --> 04:23:50,000
Hopefully we don't cause like horrible hyperinflation or have some horrible issue like that.

2799
04:23:50,000 --> 04:23:55,000
But I guess, you know, part of partly this is what what an early access is to find out.

2800
04:23:55,000 --> 04:23:57,000
Right. Like whether there's any issues.

2801
04:23:57,000 --> 04:23:59,000
Was there any economy testing?

2802
04:23:59,000 --> 04:24:02,000
Was there any surprises with that or with gold in terms of how things panned out?

2803
04:24:02,000 --> 04:24:04,000
Thankfully, not honestly.

2804
04:24:04,000 --> 04:24:10,000
Like we were worried, but thankfully none of the like horrible situations came to pass with that and ended up working just fine.

2805
04:24:10,000 --> 04:24:14,000
So, yeah, like it went great.

2806
04:24:14,000 --> 04:24:18,000
Who'd have thought 10 years later, we'd be back here saying, you know what?

2807
04:24:18,000 --> 04:24:19,000
Gold was a good idea.

2808
04:24:19,000 --> 04:24:21,000
Exactly.

2809
04:24:21,000 --> 04:24:24,000
Because I remember 10 years ago, this game's brilliant.

2810
04:24:24,000 --> 04:24:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2811
04:24:25,000 --> 04:24:26,000
Stupid gold.

2812
04:24:26,000 --> 04:24:32,000
The funny thing is, is I don't think we would have arrived at the way gold is now if we had had it in the first place.

2813
04:24:32,000 --> 04:24:36,000
Yeah. Like the non-tradability of whether they're using it as a sort of marker for how much play you've done.

2814
04:24:36,000 --> 04:24:40,000
I just I don't think that we would have ever had that way if we hadn't arrived from here.

2815
04:24:40,000 --> 04:24:43,000
So, yeah, I think that path dependency kind of did matter.

2816
04:24:43,000 --> 04:24:45,000
So, yeah.

2817
04:24:45,000 --> 04:24:48,000
The paths we weave.

2818
04:24:48,000 --> 04:25:02,000
So, how likely then based on just how successful it is, are you to want to expand the like exchanges capabilities to like other things like maps or waystones or even gear?

2819
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:05,000
Well, I mean, look, I'm interested in this, but I don't think it's necessary right now.

2820
04:25:05,000 --> 04:25:10,000
So we're not going to in early access, at least we're not going to launch with any expanded stuff in that way.

2821
04:25:10,000 --> 04:25:12,000
But I guess I do want to sort of see how it works.

2822
04:25:12,000 --> 04:25:15,000
And I'm interested in potentially trying something like that in the future.

2823
04:25:15,000 --> 04:25:19,000
I just don't like the currency exchange was like 90 percent of the problem.

2824
04:25:19,000 --> 04:25:25,000
Yeah. And so fixing that like fixed a lot of the you know, like it seemed like there would be we would need to do more initially.

2825
04:25:25,000 --> 04:25:27,000
And then maybe now it's like maybe we don't.

2826
04:25:27,000 --> 04:25:29,000
But I still I still want to experiment with it potentially.

2827
04:25:29,000 --> 04:25:31,000
So, you know, I'm interested to see how it goes.

2828
04:25:31,000 --> 04:25:33,000
But yeah, the currency exchange definitely helped a vast amount.

2829
04:25:33,000 --> 04:25:35,000
Those were the annoying trains. Yeah, they were.

2830
04:25:35,000 --> 04:25:37,000
Yeah, definitely.

2831
04:25:37,000 --> 04:25:39,000
Great.

2832
04:25:39,000 --> 04:25:41,000
So we've had some.

2833
04:25:41,000 --> 04:25:47,000
Well, so this is a tricky question to answer, especially if we could just scroll down.

2834
04:25:47,000 --> 04:25:49,000
Yeah.

2835
04:25:49,000 --> 04:25:55,000
So what are you aiming for in terms of Path of Exile 2 is kind of like personal player economy and progression.

2836
04:25:55,000 --> 04:26:06,000
So how much resources you're acquiring, how you're using them, but also how much are you getting from trade versus from yourself?

2837
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:13,000
I mean, this is a tricky question, but I mean, I think that really the feeling of being able to trade is super important.

2838
04:26:13,000 --> 04:26:15,000
So being able to get that stuff, I think is good.

2839
04:26:15,000 --> 04:26:17,000
But now not everyone wants to do that.

2840
04:26:17,000 --> 04:26:19,000
You need to be able to progress the game well without having to do much trade.

2841
04:26:19,000 --> 04:26:28,000
But I do think that like, you know, look, it's definitely going to be the case that if you're playing in a trade league, you're going to have the ability to accelerate you very significantly.

2842
04:26:28,000 --> 04:26:29,000
And that's that's the case.

2843
04:26:29,000 --> 04:26:30,000
And it will continue to be the case.

2844
04:26:30,000 --> 04:26:32,000
And yeah, like we are a game that embraces trade.

2845
04:26:32,000 --> 04:26:37,000
Yeah, I think the DNA of Path of Exile 1 is very much that like it is a game about economy and trade.

2846
04:26:37,000 --> 04:26:41,000
And for some people getting riches, they're main motivator.

2847
04:26:41,000 --> 04:26:42,000
100%.

2848
04:26:42,000 --> 04:26:43,000
So effectively, yes.

2849
04:26:43,000 --> 04:26:44,000
So I mean, that that will absolutely be a factor.

2850
04:26:44,000 --> 04:26:49,000
And look, like, I think that the feeling of that will probably end up feeling quite similar to POE1 in that regard.

2851
04:26:49,000 --> 04:26:52,000
And I think that's what you know, that's the type of game we're making.

2852
04:26:52,000 --> 04:26:59,000
Yeah. Do you think it's that said, though, do you think it is in some ways better for us all a self-found sort of experience?

2853
04:26:59,000 --> 04:27:09,000
I mean, I simply do simply because again, as we talked about, we're dropping a lot more currency that we expect you to use on gear as opposed to save to end game for one.

2854
04:27:09,000 --> 04:27:17,000
And then by end game, like we don't have Kiraak mods costing, you know, that kind of stuff that all costs chaos.

2855
04:27:17,000 --> 04:27:20,000
And you don't have like the meta mods costing divines and all that.

2856
04:27:20,000 --> 04:27:22,000
Right. They're all different items.

2857
04:27:22,000 --> 04:27:23,000
You know, I want meta mod crafting.

2858
04:27:23,000 --> 04:27:24,000
There's a ritual.

2859
04:27:24,000 --> 04:27:25,000
I know where to get it as well.

2860
04:27:25,000 --> 04:27:26,000
Right.

2861
04:27:26,000 --> 04:27:37,000
But you're not just like having to, I'm blocked behind this thing because I need so many divines and I can't get that because I'm solo self-found and farming divines is not exactly, you know, beyond trivial.

2862
04:27:37,000 --> 04:27:43,000
So, you know, there's a number of ways there where I'd say it is honestly a much better solo self-found experience.

2863
04:27:43,000 --> 04:27:48,000
But, you know, each to their own, that to be seen and, you know.

2864
04:27:48,000 --> 04:27:53,000
And there'll be a separate solo self-found mode, presumably, even potentially beta launch or in the future?

2865
04:27:53,000 --> 04:27:55,000
So that is our intention to have hardcore and solo self-found.

2866
04:27:55,000 --> 04:27:56,000
I love both of them.

2867
04:27:56,000 --> 04:27:57,000
Cool.

2868
04:27:57,000 --> 04:28:01,000
I wouldn't play hardcore for your first round, honestly, because you're likely to die.

2869
04:28:01,000 --> 04:28:03,000
Once you learn the boss mechanics, it should be fine.

2870
04:28:03,000 --> 04:28:04,000
But someone's gonna.

2871
04:28:04,000 --> 04:28:06,000
First time, you know, it's going to be tricky.

2872
04:28:06,000 --> 04:28:09,000
Couch co-op hardcore and you get to see a friend die right next to you.

2873
04:28:09,000 --> 04:28:11,000
That's the true dream.

2874
04:28:11,000 --> 04:28:13,000
Actually, hang on a minute.

2875
04:28:13,000 --> 04:28:16,000
In couch co-op hardcore, do we still lock the camera so you can't walk away from your friend?

2876
04:28:16,000 --> 04:28:18,000
No, we put you back to solo.

2877
04:28:18,000 --> 04:28:19,000
You put you back to solo.

2878
04:28:19,000 --> 04:28:20,000
Okay, great.

2879
04:28:20,000 --> 04:28:21,000
That's good to know.

2880
04:28:21,000 --> 04:28:24,000
It's like you have a morning period of about 30 seconds.

2881
04:28:24,000 --> 04:28:25,000
Right, right, right.

2882
04:28:25,000 --> 04:28:27,000
But you just say, all right, you can go home now.

2883
04:28:27,000 --> 04:28:30,000
What do you do?

2884
04:28:30,000 --> 04:28:34,000
Yeah, that is a devastating moment.

2885
04:28:34,000 --> 04:28:41,000
So I did lose my place there.

2886
04:28:41,000 --> 04:28:45,000
Yeah, I think we mentioned co-op support and everything.

2887
04:28:45,000 --> 04:28:47,000
We'll scroll down and take some of the additional questions here.

2888
04:28:47,000 --> 04:28:48,000
Excellent.

2889
04:28:48,000 --> 04:28:49,000
Thanks.

2890
04:28:49,000 --> 04:28:57,000
So will there be a penalty for individual party member dying when grouping up for bosses on that note?

2891
04:28:57,000 --> 04:29:02,000
It seems weird that the boss straight up resets when playing solo, but when playing in a group, nothing happens if a party member dies.

2892
04:29:02,000 --> 04:29:04,000
Tell us about the rules.

2893
04:29:04,000 --> 04:29:06,000
I know you've changed them recently.

2894
04:29:06,000 --> 04:29:10,000
Yeah, so bosses are obviously harder for having more people.

2895
04:29:10,000 --> 04:29:16,000
Less crowd controls, things like obviously more life.

2896
04:29:16,000 --> 04:29:18,000
And I'm not saying double life, more than double life.

2897
04:29:18,000 --> 04:29:25,000
It does get more than twice as hard or more than end players as hard.

2898
04:29:25,000 --> 04:29:28,000
So yes, you could argue, okay, we have reviving as an advantage.

2899
04:29:28,000 --> 04:29:29,000
Well, yes, it does.

2900
04:29:29,000 --> 04:29:31,000
It does take time to revive.

2901
04:29:31,000 --> 04:29:38,000
And if your friend dies early and you're unable to revive them because you're constantly being interrupted, well, you're not having a fun time.

2902
04:29:38,000 --> 04:29:39,000
You get a big stun or something.

2903
04:29:39,000 --> 04:29:47,000
Another change that we made recently is, of course, for each revived between each set of checkpoints, every time you have to revive them, the revive takes longer.

2904
04:29:47,000 --> 04:29:48,000
Subsequent times.

2905
04:29:48,000 --> 04:29:54,000
So that's important because it just means that if you're like you can't revive spam anymore because it's longer and longer each time.

2906
04:29:54,000 --> 04:29:58,000
But then when you go to a checkpoint that resets, so like you're back to normal.

2907
04:29:58,000 --> 04:30:00,000
In game maps, you cannot revive each other.

2908
04:30:00,000 --> 04:30:02,000
Death is a consequence.

2909
04:30:02,000 --> 04:30:04,000
Yeah.

2910
04:30:04,000 --> 04:30:08,000
I was going to ask actually about like in game maps and what is the rule for dying in a game map?

2911
04:30:08,000 --> 04:30:10,000
Is it one portal deal now, not six portals?

2912
04:30:10,000 --> 04:30:13,000
Well, you still have six portals so you have your party members, but death.

2913
04:30:13,000 --> 04:30:15,000
And you can leave and come back.

2914
04:30:15,000 --> 04:30:19,000
You can take items out, but a death will end that map for you.

2915
04:30:19,000 --> 04:30:20,000
Yeah.

2916
04:30:20,000 --> 04:30:29,000
And to remind people, if you log out or server crashes or something like that's going to happen, then the game pauses.

2917
04:30:29,000 --> 04:30:32,000
So when you log when you boot the game back up and log back in, you'll be still in your map.

2918
04:30:32,000 --> 04:30:42,000
And also, we've also now have it so that if you just order for the game at a random time, you'll actually even if you come back like the next day.

2919
04:30:43,000 --> 04:30:45,000
Because for example, you might have rage quit.

2920
04:30:45,000 --> 04:30:48,000
You will appear back at the checkpoint you were at.

2921
04:30:48,000 --> 04:30:53,000
So if you are like fighting a boss, you die a bunch of times, you're like, oh crap, order for you come back.

2922
04:30:53,000 --> 04:30:55,000
You're going to be right there at the boss checkpoint.

2923
04:30:55,000 --> 04:30:58,000
That part is campaign specific because there are no checkpoints in maps.

2924
04:30:58,000 --> 04:31:03,000
Yeah, non maps. But for the campaign though, that honestly has helped a lot.

2925
04:31:04,000 --> 04:31:13,000
There were so many. I think it really did cause new players to have problems in PRB1 where they felt like they just lost track of where the hell they even were when they came back after a session.

2926
04:31:13,000 --> 04:31:16,000
They might have not got waypoints at certain times or things like that.

2927
04:31:16,000 --> 04:31:21,000
You now kind of have a situation where you log back in and you're like, oh, I forgot like three waypoints in a row.

2928
04:31:21,000 --> 04:31:25,000
Now I'm like freaking miles away from where I was, which I think happened to new players fairly frequently.

2929
04:31:25,000 --> 04:31:30,000
I'm glad in a world where everyone's becoming a souls like that you guys didn't do the running back to the boss.

2930
04:31:30,000 --> 04:31:32,000
Right, right, right.

2931
04:31:32,000 --> 04:31:33,000
And you just kind of jump back in.

2932
04:31:33,000 --> 04:31:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

2933
04:31:34,000 --> 04:31:35,000
And have another crack.

2934
04:31:35,000 --> 04:31:42,000
So yeah, so effectively like that, that's nice to just have the same checkpoints to your character, which I think is a nice one.

2935
04:31:42,000 --> 04:31:45,000
Were there any other mechanics around there reviving?

2936
04:31:45,000 --> 04:31:47,000
Well, obviously in hardcore you did, you did.

2937
04:31:47,000 --> 04:31:49,000
That's the drill.

2938
04:31:49,000 --> 04:31:55,000
So your maps almost embraces a kind of semi hardcore mentality there where there is actual cost.

2939
04:31:55,000 --> 04:32:07,000
Like we went through so many iterations here where it's like, OK, like the moment that you have to spend something of economic value to do the attempt, hence a map item.

2940
04:32:07,000 --> 04:32:14,000
And especially if it's got breaches and all this content that's coming from precursor tablets, all of this stuff is worth stuff.

2941
04:32:14,000 --> 04:32:24,000
So you all of a sudden have heaps of stuff on the line and then you don't want to be in a position where you're like, no, I need to bring in some people to do this because I'm not going to risk that value.

2942
04:32:24,000 --> 04:32:27,000
So that's why we just were like in maps, no reviving.

2943
04:32:27,000 --> 04:32:28,000
It's just like, yeah, sure.

2944
04:32:28,000 --> 04:32:32,000
You still can always bring in any context someone way more powerful than you to carry things, right?

2945
04:32:32,000 --> 04:32:35,000
That's the benefit of multiplayer.

2946
04:32:35,000 --> 04:32:41,000
But feeling like you have to do this thing because then they can just keep reviving you so you can get all the rewards.

2947
04:32:41,000 --> 04:32:43,000
We're trying to get away from all of that.

2948
04:32:43,000 --> 04:32:48,000
Otherwise you get this weird thing where like you're often always too scared to do the thing.

2949
04:32:48,000 --> 04:32:58,000
Now, now you're scared, but everyone's scared and it's fine and you don't feel like you're like, OK, you have to go on with a sense of confidence to like I can definitely do this thing.

2950
04:32:58,000 --> 04:33:02,000
And so it's just a little bit less fear when it comes to all of a sudden doing that.

2951
04:33:02,000 --> 04:33:11,000
That's much better in the context of the fact that you can pause the game if your cat's on fire or if the server crashes or something that you just paused and you can jump back in as well.

2952
04:33:11,000 --> 04:33:14,000
You're failing because of your own faults.

2953
04:33:14,000 --> 04:33:19,000
Now it's worth noting in multiplayer, we do have a thing, of course, with respawn at checkpoints as an option.

2954
04:33:19,000 --> 04:33:28,000
So if a player dies and you don't want to like you don't want to die, you don't want to finish the fight out, you can both choose to respawn at checkpoint and then it will just create a new instance.

2955
04:33:28,000 --> 04:33:34,000
You don't have to die to do it and you don't have to log out and do any shenanigans like that.

2956
04:33:34,000 --> 04:33:37,000
You can just press escape, hit respawn at checkpoint.

2957
04:33:37,000 --> 04:33:40,000
It will ask other players to confirm and then it moves you all to the new area.

2958
04:33:40,000 --> 04:33:47,000
Cool. Excellent. I don't want to go super on it because we've definitely talked about it before, but click to move versus WSD has definitely been asked about a bit.

2959
04:33:47,000 --> 04:33:50,000
So there's been plenty of reports about WSD being amazing.

2960
04:33:50,000 --> 04:33:52,000
Personally, I've been using it a ton and really enjoying it.

2961
04:33:52,000 --> 04:33:58,000
I know a lot of you've said a lot of people around the office have like given it a try and adapted to that.

2962
04:33:58,000 --> 04:34:07,000
But it has raised the point for people that feel like they're still very much against that for whatever reason, or maybe that they literally only have one hand and want to use click to move still.

2963
04:34:07,000 --> 04:34:10,000
How does it stack up? How does click to move still stack up now?

2964
04:34:10,000 --> 04:34:13,000
I think honestly it's fine. It's not been a problem.

2965
04:34:13,000 --> 04:34:22,000
There was a time where every time I'd go to sit down at a developer's computer, it'd be in WSD and just because it's a little bit easier to move around again or whatever.

2966
04:34:22,000 --> 04:34:29,000
But lately I'd say now it's back to almost every designer's computer I sit back down at to go play there back and click to move.

2967
04:34:29,000 --> 04:34:31,000
Interesting. It's gone full tilt the other way.

2968
04:34:31,000 --> 04:34:40,000
But even watching Octavian play on click to move, he's a hundred percent click to move curious. He's very proficient with that.

2969
04:34:40,000 --> 04:34:50,000
That'll be reassuring for I think some of the people that are worried about being forced into WSD, even though it is obviously playing so well by all accounts.

2970
04:34:50,000 --> 04:34:52,000
That's very good then.

2971
04:34:52,000 --> 04:34:55,000
And Octavian is often doing the demonstrations for your live things too.

2972
04:34:55,000 --> 04:34:56,000
You'll be able to see that even.

2973
04:34:56,000 --> 04:35:03,000
I have to force them to play WSD sometimes because I'm like, oh, I think the Mercenary looks so much better with WSD just visually.

2974
04:35:03,000 --> 04:35:04,000
So, you know, I tell them to.

2975
04:35:04,000 --> 04:35:06,000
It does feel very good on the Mercenary.

2976
04:35:06,000 --> 04:35:07,000
Yeah.

2977
04:35:07,000 --> 04:35:11,000
They're kind of like stalking through, especially with that kind of like preparational tactical play style.

2978
04:35:11,000 --> 04:35:12,000
Yeah, that's good.

2979
04:35:12,000 --> 04:35:14,000
Loving it so far.

2980
04:35:14,000 --> 04:35:16,000
We did already talk about the skin transfers.

2981
04:35:16,000 --> 04:35:20,000
Can we scroll down to any additional questions that we have?

2982
04:35:20,000 --> 04:35:22,000
I feel like we have a lot of questions.

2983
04:35:22,000 --> 04:35:23,000
I mean, it's a while.

2984
04:35:23,000 --> 04:35:25,000
We're getting creep in at this point.

2985
04:35:25,000 --> 04:35:26,000
Exactly.

2986
04:35:26,000 --> 04:35:27,000
We've been going.

2987
04:35:27,000 --> 04:35:28,000
We've been rolling.

2988
04:35:28,000 --> 04:35:29,000
Yeah.

2989
04:35:29,000 --> 04:35:34,000
People asking if there's going to be anything like challenges or challenge rewards in the early access.

2990
04:35:34,000 --> 04:35:36,000
Not at first, no.

2991
04:35:36,000 --> 04:35:37,000
We will do it later though.

2992
04:35:37,000 --> 04:35:40,000
Did I ask about races, events and private leagues?

2993
04:35:40,000 --> 04:35:44,000
I think not initially, but we will do it later for sure.

2994
04:35:44,000 --> 04:35:49,000
I think the I'm not sure what happened because I think I think the early access is going to be a bit of a challenge.

2995
04:35:49,000 --> 04:35:54,000
I think the I'm not sure what happened because I think I think the issue was that the private league interface was like on the P.O.E.

2996
04:35:54,000 --> 04:35:56,000
one site and we had to do some work and something like that.

2997
04:35:56,000 --> 04:35:57,000
It wouldn't be far away though.

2998
04:35:57,000 --> 04:35:59,000
It won't take that long before we get to it.

2999
04:35:59,000 --> 04:36:01,000
I can't exactly remember either.

3000
04:36:01,000 --> 04:36:03,000
But yeah, it wouldn't be private leagues in particular.

3001
04:36:03,000 --> 04:36:04,000
It wouldn't be far away.

3002
04:36:04,000 --> 04:36:05,000
Yeah.

3003
04:36:05,000 --> 04:36:06,000
Yeah.

3004
04:36:06,000 --> 04:36:09,000
So I mean, we'll have them just not like right initially, potentially.

3005
04:36:09,000 --> 04:36:11,000
And I think I did miss this actually.

3006
04:36:11,000 --> 04:36:14,000
So cluster jewels are a thing or not a thing.

3007
04:36:14,000 --> 04:36:15,000
Are they they've been kind of replaced by those?

3008
04:36:15,000 --> 04:36:18,000
Yeah, we replaced them with that almost like rollable timeless jewel kind of thing.

3009
04:36:18,000 --> 04:36:20,000
Yeah, that's at least for now.

3010
04:36:20,000 --> 04:36:25,000
There's like so much passive tree there and the jewels accomplished the kind of off build thing anyway.

3011
04:36:25,000 --> 04:36:29,000
Hardly need to add the extra passive trees on your passive trees.

3012
04:36:29,000 --> 04:36:30,000
Yes.

3013
04:36:30,000 --> 04:36:31,000
Yes.

3014
04:36:31,000 --> 04:36:32,000
We don't have to launch.

3015
04:36:32,000 --> 04:36:33,000
We made the passive tree implicitly bigger.

3016
04:36:33,000 --> 04:36:36,000
So because the jewels are in the tree.

3017
04:36:36,000 --> 04:36:37,000
Thanks again.

3018
04:36:37,000 --> 04:36:38,000
I talk about like year three features.

3019
04:36:38,000 --> 04:36:41,000
That's that's around a year three to year five feature as well.

3020
04:36:42,000 --> 04:36:50,000
Yeah, we got another decade of what we had with Path of Exile one to look forward to for Path of Exile two, hopefully, before we start worrying about Path of Exile three, maybe.

3021
04:36:50,000 --> 04:36:52,000
Geez.

3022
04:36:52,000 --> 04:36:55,000
You go just just start thinking, just start thinking about that.

3023
04:36:55,000 --> 04:36:57,000
Give us a little while.

3024
04:36:57,000 --> 04:36:58,000
We are.

3025
04:36:58,000 --> 04:37:01,000
So I guess to just finish us off for today then.

3026
04:37:01,000 --> 04:37:06,000
Do you guys have a recommendation or what is the best class to play in the beta?

3027
04:37:06,000 --> 04:37:08,000
I mean, that's a very hard one.

3028
04:37:08,000 --> 04:37:09,000
Honestly, like.

3029
04:37:09,000 --> 04:37:10,000
So many choices now.

3030
04:37:10,000 --> 04:37:11,000
There are.

3031
04:37:11,000 --> 04:37:12,000
So let me.

3032
04:37:12,000 --> 04:37:13,000
Well, OK.

3033
04:37:13,000 --> 04:37:14,000
If we're going by the numbers.

3034
04:37:14,000 --> 04:37:15,000
Oh yeah.

3035
04:37:15,000 --> 04:37:20,000
If we go by player satisfaction reports on per class, we break it down from the beta.

3036
04:37:20,000 --> 04:37:22,000
This is good technical information here.

3037
04:37:22,000 --> 04:37:27,000
Then that means the monk is very interesting because the monk is the class that dies the most often.

3038
04:37:27,000 --> 04:37:33,000
It's also the class that when people play it, they have the highest satisfaction level by a very, very tiny margin compared to the others.

3039
04:37:33,000 --> 04:37:34,000
That's fascinating.

3040
04:37:34,000 --> 04:37:39,000
I mean, it is like glass cannon, you know, like it's very fast, but you have to you have to retreat and move in and out.

3041
04:37:39,000 --> 04:37:40,000
I fell in love with the monk playing it.

3042
04:37:40,000 --> 04:37:41,000
It looks like it's got a little better.

3043
04:37:41,000 --> 04:37:42,000
Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

3044
04:37:42,000 --> 04:37:48,000
But I think if you're a new player, then the mercenary, if you're like used to shooters and stuff, I think playing the mercenary could be a good one.

3045
04:37:48,000 --> 04:37:50,000
Like I really love that class.

3046
04:37:50,000 --> 04:37:53,000
I know I've been loving the mercenary.

3047
04:37:53,000 --> 04:37:58,000
But to me, it feels like you need to really be considering each engagement a lot more.

3048
04:37:58,000 --> 04:38:00,000
It's a bit more tactical.

3049
04:38:00,000 --> 04:38:01,000
I like it.

3050
04:38:01,000 --> 04:38:03,000
I really like that.

3051
04:38:04,000 --> 04:38:11,000
Honestly, like I mean, I go through favorite classes all the time whenever I change to play a different class that becomes my favorite.

3052
04:38:11,000 --> 04:38:14,000
So, you know, whatever I'm playing tends to be the thing.

3053
04:38:14,000 --> 04:38:16,000
So yeah, right now I'm doing a mercenary playthrough.

3054
04:38:16,000 --> 04:38:18,000
So that's probably why I'm into that.

3055
04:38:18,000 --> 04:38:21,000
But yeah, I'm not sure if you've got a similar.

3056
04:38:21,000 --> 04:38:23,000
You're talking about the numbers as well.

3057
04:38:23,000 --> 04:38:26,000
It was interesting that monk and then warrior had the highest satisfaction.

3058
04:38:26,000 --> 04:38:29,000
Warrior is next, by the way, technically, if you're looking for.

3059
04:38:29,000 --> 04:38:30,000
That's pretty good.

3060
04:38:30,000 --> 04:38:32,000
That's two melee classes.

3061
04:38:32,000 --> 04:38:33,000
Exactly.

3062
04:38:33,000 --> 04:38:34,000
That's a win.

3063
04:38:34,000 --> 04:38:35,000
Yeah, that's something going on.

3064
04:38:35,000 --> 04:38:37,000
I mean, they were dying a lot more at the time.

3065
04:38:37,000 --> 04:38:40,000
It's such a change from like, especially early Pufferpigs I won.

3066
04:38:40,000 --> 04:38:42,000
Like it's got a little better in one day.

3067
04:38:42,000 --> 04:38:46,000
But still, I mean, I just have a light real desire to freeze time.

3068
04:38:46,000 --> 04:38:49,000
So I just want to go.

3069
04:38:49,000 --> 04:38:51,000
I don't know what skills I'll play.

3070
04:38:51,000 --> 04:38:52,000
I feel like she's not getting enough.

3071
04:38:52,000 --> 04:38:56,000
I don't know what skills I'll play, but I definitely just want to be able to freeze time.

3072
04:38:56,000 --> 04:38:58,000
So I just feel so.

3073
04:38:58,000 --> 04:38:59,000
All right. So you could be playing.

3074
04:38:59,000 --> 04:39:00,000
You could be playing crossbow building.

3075
04:39:00,000 --> 04:39:02,000
Yeah, I might be a crossbow time freezer.

3076
04:39:02,000 --> 04:39:03,000
I don't know.

3077
04:39:03,000 --> 04:39:04,000
We'll see what's going on.

3078
04:39:04,000 --> 04:39:05,000
Yeah, all right.

3079
04:39:05,000 --> 04:39:08,000
I noted I liked that I'd noted that our mercenaries were very different as well.

3080
04:39:08,000 --> 04:39:09,000
I was playing full Grenada.

3081
04:39:09,000 --> 04:39:10,000
You were.

3082
04:39:10,000 --> 04:39:12,000
I was doing the freeze, the freeze, freeze shotgun.

3083
04:39:12,000 --> 04:39:13,000
Yeah, very cool.

3084
04:39:13,000 --> 04:39:14,000
Yeah.

3085
04:39:14,000 --> 04:39:15,000
Yeah.

3086
04:39:15,000 --> 04:39:19,000
Some sort of monk trigger build, obviously, is always just going to be fun to.

3087
04:39:19,000 --> 04:39:20,000
Yeah.

3088
04:39:20,000 --> 04:39:23,000
So many of those like stacking effects, the wind and the ice coming off it.

3089
04:39:23,000 --> 04:39:25,000
And the sentencies showed some more as well.

3090
04:39:25,000 --> 04:39:29,000
Just see how far they can be pushed and how many spells can I get to.

3091
04:39:29,000 --> 04:39:30,000
Trigger per second.

3092
04:39:30,000 --> 04:39:32,000
Yeah, like doesn't seem good for that.

3093
04:39:32,000 --> 04:39:33,000
All righty.

3094
04:39:33,000 --> 04:39:35,000
Well, thank you very much for your time.

3095
04:39:35,000 --> 04:39:38,000
Both of you for I don't even know how long that was a mammoth session.

3096
04:39:38,000 --> 04:39:39,000
Coming up to one o'clock here.

3097
04:39:39,000 --> 04:39:41,000
So, you know, still wants to talk about.

3098
04:39:41,000 --> 04:39:43,000
I think we just need some time to digest for sure.

3099
04:39:43,000 --> 04:39:47,000
So thankfully we didn't have everyone saying patch notes when this time.

3100
04:39:47,000 --> 04:39:48,000
So good.

3101
04:39:48,000 --> 04:39:50,000
So that's a conversation.

3102
04:39:50,000 --> 04:39:51,000
There's no pressure on this.

3103
04:39:51,000 --> 04:39:52,000
Wrap it up.

3104
04:39:52,000 --> 04:39:54,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

3105
04:39:54,000 --> 04:39:56,000
So, you know, that's good.

3106
04:39:56,000 --> 04:39:57,000
Fantastic.

3107
04:39:57,000 --> 04:39:58,000
All right.

3108
04:39:58,000 --> 04:40:00,000
Thank you very much for watching everybody.

3109
04:40:00,000 --> 04:40:01,000
I hope you enjoyed the Q&A.

3110
04:40:01,000 --> 04:40:02,000
That was a good day.

3111
04:40:02,000 --> 04:40:03,000
They want patch notes now.

3112
04:40:03,000 --> 04:40:05,000
It's not a patch.

3113
04:40:05,000 --> 04:40:06,000
Exactly.

3114
04:40:06,000 --> 04:40:07,000
Where's the launch notes?

3115
04:40:07,000 --> 04:40:08,000
Yeah.

3116
04:40:08,000 --> 04:40:09,000
All right.

3117
04:40:09,000 --> 04:40:10,000
Yeah.

3118
04:40:10,000 --> 04:40:12,000
And thank you very much.

3119
04:40:12,000 --> 04:40:13,000
Thanks, Heaps.

3120
04:40:13,000 --> 04:40:14,000
Appreciate it.

3121
04:40:14,000 --> 04:40:15,000
It's been an epic journey.

3122
04:40:15,000 --> 04:40:16,000
It's kind of surreal.

3123
04:40:16,000 --> 04:40:19,000
And it's only the start of another journey, really.

3124
04:40:19,000 --> 04:40:20,000
So that's it.

3125
04:40:20,000 --> 04:40:21,000
Yeah.

3126
04:40:21,000 --> 04:40:22,000
Can't wait to play.

3127
04:40:22,000 --> 04:40:23,000
It's cool.

3128
04:40:23,000 --> 04:40:25,000
I'm going to play more now, but yeah.

3129
04:40:25,000 --> 04:40:26,000
True.

3130
04:40:26,000 --> 04:40:27,000
Sorry.

3131
04:40:27,000 --> 04:40:30,000
I got to go fix bosses going up elevators.

3132
04:40:30,000 --> 04:40:31,000
Sorry.

3133
04:40:31,000 --> 04:40:32,000
Yeah.

3134
04:40:32,000 --> 04:40:33,000
I'm just pre-bug testing.

3135
04:40:33,000 --> 04:40:34,000
All right.

3136
04:40:34,000 --> 04:40:35,000
I assume we've faded out and cut.

3137
04:40:35,000 --> 04:40:36,000
Hopefully.

3138
04:40:36,000 --> 04:40:37,000
You never know.

3139
04:40:37,000 --> 04:40:38,000
Hopefully.

3140
04:48:38,000 --> 04:48:39,000
Bye.

3141
04:48:39,000 --> 04:48:39,000
Bye.
