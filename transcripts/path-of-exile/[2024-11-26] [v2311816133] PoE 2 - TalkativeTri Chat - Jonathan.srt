1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay.

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Studio mode off.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Exiles.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Do you see Jonathan Rogers?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Question number two.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Do you hear Jonathan Rogers?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Jonathan, can you do a sound check, please?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're in the new studio today.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, you know, that's pretty nice.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm, you know, very nice little area that I'm sitting in here.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Perfect.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is he a good audio level, everyone?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Or a little louder?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I believe we're good.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Perfect levels, Jonathan.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Nice.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, man.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Like I said a second ago, you are nine days out from Path of Exile 2 launching and everyone I'm talking to is excited.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It doesn't matter if they've been playing Path of Exile 1 for years.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It doesn't matter if they literally haven't played video games ever.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
However, I show them just the snippet from the trailer and they are ready to log in on December 6th.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So my first question, what's the secret sauce?

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How are you guys doing this?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How is grinding your games making non-gamers ready to log into a hardcore ARPG?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think we just have a, like, when we're presenting our content, we always do it in a way where we're thinking about, you know, like, how are people going to react to it?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Like, you know, we just, and the other thing as well is that we're not afraid to put information in our videos.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Like, I think a lot of people are kind of like, you know, hey, you know, tone it back a little bit.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You know, like, people don't need so much information, this kind of stuff.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But personally, I'm kind of a fan of just like, you know, let's just put everything out there.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And if you do that, I think people get excited.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, you know, I guess that's my philosophy about it anyway.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I think people do resonate with that.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you show them just, you know, show them what you got cooking and show them gameplay, show them, you know, how they be able to, how they're able to use all the tools you give them.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I think they'll be excited.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Definitely.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And I hate to bring it up, but it wasn't an interview that dropped today with Legendary Drops.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
How, just during the Settlers of Calgary reveal, you all pivoted to focus entirely on Endgame.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How is your company that agile?

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because I work at a company of about 70 people.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We are not agile at all.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What are your processes like internally as developers?

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Like, how can you move on a dime and just go in?

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I mean, I guess it's just about not being afraid to do it, right?

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I mean, certainly it causes some consternation, right?

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I mean, nobody likes being like jerked around from one task to the other, that kind of thing.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But I think it is important because it just gives us the ability to really make sure we're reacting to what we think is important.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And so, yeah, I mean, you know, like, I don't know what to say, really.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I mean, just like, you know, we just have to make those kinds of decisions and just tell people, you know, this is really what we have to do.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Like, when you realize that you're not doing the right thing, you really have to jump on, you know, you can't just sort of say, oh, well, you know, we just keep going to doing the wrong thing just because there's so much inertia, right?

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Like, you have to actually try to turn the ship around.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And so, you know, yeah, that's what we did.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Awesome.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
All right, Jonathan, I have the interview broken down into various different categories here.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I wanted to start with questions about new players in particular and just people logging into the game, playing it for the first time in their experiences.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So I wanted to start with the fact that in Path of Exile 1, it's renowned for not many people making it even to Brutus.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I mean, I know it's a free-to-play game.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
A lot of people try it out.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But even when it was paid, I'm sure a lot of people bounced early on.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So I'm curious, first five minutes of Path of Exile 2, do you think that onboarding experience is solid and you're going to really wrap people in and get them progressing further into the game?

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm pretty sure it is.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And I think that, like, if you're talking about literally the first five minutes, then I think that what will really just get you in is the fact that just the feeling of combat is much better.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And that's really the thing you're going to appreciate from the first moment that you start playing.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The other thing as well is we have a lot of, not necessarily, I mean, in the first five minutes you're going to come upon your first boss, right?

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And that will be a much more engaging experience than Hillock was, you know what I mean?

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Like, the first bosses are significantly better.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But even just after that, right, even the first 15 minutes, there's, like, other bosses really close.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're sort of getting into that experience of having the more interesting combat and more interesting things going on just sort of right away.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And, you know, it's funny.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I had a friend over at my place who was playing the game the other day.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And there was a word I thought was really interesting that he used for this.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He's like, oh, you're so generous with the content.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And I was kind of like, it's kind of an interesting way to look at it is, like, you know, like, you know, he's kind of like you're giving people what they want so quickly.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's kind of like, you know, I find that's kind of an interesting way to look at it.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But, you know, yeah, I mean, basically, we just want people to have a good time.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And, you know, even from the very beginning, like before we even made Path of Exile 1, like when we founded the company, one of the things that I had as my metric is, like, what's the time to first zombie?

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know what I mean?

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Like, when's the first moment you can actually kill something?

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You know, like you just kill, like, a basic enemy.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I kind of want to make that sure that that's as minimal as possible.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And that's why we kind of make sure that we start the game the way we do it with, like, action immediately and that kind of stuff.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So, you know, that's kind of just a philosophy we've always had.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Definitely.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Getting people right into the action is important.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And lots of people, especially viewers of my channel, are completely new Path of Exile players.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They've never played an ARPG.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
They never played Path of Exile 1.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And they are wondering, in Jonathan's eyes, what is the busted build?

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What is the archetype they should log in and play on December 6th if they want to get into the action fast?

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm not going to use you for clickbait videos, Jonathan.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Jonathan, I'm just wondering, from your view, I know you said people really like the monk that had a high satisfaction score.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But is it the most powerful?

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Not necessarily.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I mean, look, I honestly don't know that I should be recommending builds particularly.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I mean, I've said a few times, I think, that, like, I think the mercenary could be a very good new player-friendly class.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Both because you're further away from the action and just because of that, like, instant response of everything.

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like, with, you know, if you're going to pick something like the warrior or something like that, you're going to have to worry about the fact that, you know,

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
you have to commit to attacks and this kind of stuff.

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Whereas with something like the mercenary, because it's so fast from the point where you, like, you know, attack and the point you recover,

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and also because you're further back, I think that could be a very good choice for new players.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But honestly, like, any class can work.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Like, any class can be the one that you work.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And, look, the main reason why we have classes in the first place, like, because, I mean, we could be a game that just has, like, zero, you know, introductory stuff.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Like, we already let you choose between and mix and match all the different skills and weapons and things like that.

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So the reason why we have classes at all is because people really want, like, a stereotype to latch onto when they start the game to think about, like,

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
okay, how am I going to build my character, right?

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So you show them some things, like, you know, like, here's a ranger and here's a sorceress and so on.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And then when they see that, they immediately get an idea in the head about what kind of thing it is that they might want to do.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So I think that when it comes to that, like, you're best off just picking, like, what excites you, right?

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like, what is the thing that just makes you feel like, oh, yeah, I could see how I'm going to play this, right?

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And so you do that and then I think you'll have a good time.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I baited you into that answer.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's exactly what we wanted to hear, man.

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Whatever you're going to have the most fun with.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And I'm curious on character selection.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I know it was talked about in the past that ascendancies might appear on that screen.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Are they still not there and you find out about them in the trials?

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, they're still not there.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Look, that screen is certainly something that needs some UI attention.

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We just haven't had time to work on it more.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So there's so many things I would still improve even now.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But, I mean, look, that's what the early access is for, right?

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There's going to be tons of time to improve on that stuff.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But, yeah, for the beginning, it's just like, you know, pick what you think sounds like it would be cool, right?

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And we do have a few, like, little videos of skills and things like that on that screen which, like, show, you know,

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and, like, it kind of gives, like, so it gives kind of three main points for each class of, like,

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
here's the kind of things you can expect from that class.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And there's a little video for each one as well.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So we've got a little bit of information there, but we don't have, like, yeah, full-on ascendancy classes and everything there.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think there's room for that sort of stuff, but not at the moment.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Awesome.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now I want to move on to testing and what new players, completely new players to ARPGs, found the most challenging in Path of Exile 2.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've heard that Path of Exile 1 players were just shocked by the difficulty of the combat.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right, right, right.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And newer players were kind of fine with it.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What did they find challenging, though?

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because I know you did a lot of first-user testing, and I found that very interesting because you're going to get a lot of first-users on December 6th.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What did they find hard?

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So definitely the things they were finding the most challenging was the character customization and itemization stuff, right?

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Like, that's where they're kind of, you know, potentially finding that they, you know, that, like, so, I mean, we asked quite a lot of questions about, like, you know, what do you feel like you're skilled at and that kind of stuff.

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Like, you know, try to sort of get a gauge for, like, you know, how people rate their own skills in different areas.

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And it was certainly, like, understanding itemization that was the part that people found the hardest.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So we've actually done quite a few things to improve in that area, I think, since then.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I mean, like, it's just kind of subtle stuff, but just over time we've just been, you know, carefully massaging towards a situation where, you know, it's easier to find the stuff that you need to find.

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's, you know, there's more help.

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There's more guidance.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There's also things like, you know, the socketing system being, I think, a lot easier than the crafting bench system that we had and things like that.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So there's things like that, I think, that will help a lot.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So that's kind of the stuff that I think new players find the hardest.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And then I think that that's really just because, you know, yeah, I mean, like, there's a lot of stats.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There's a lot of things kind of coming at you.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You know, we just have to make sure that we're not overwhelming you too much with that stuff.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And, of course, you know, there's the giant passive tree, which always gives people a bit of a scare.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So, you know, that's really the stuff that I would say that new players find the hardest.

158
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay. Awesome.

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Now, during the betas, I know that there were a few closed beta tests.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
People were freaking out when they first got those NDA invites and everything.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Between those tests, what were the largest changes?

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And did you really change a lot about the game after the tests themselves?

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Because I know, like, when we went to L.A., you took a ton of feedback and made a huge number of changes just between March and June.

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Did that happen again with all the beta tests this year?

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah, absolutely.

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So a lot of it really comes down to difficulty.

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But the thing with difficulty is that people know the game is too hard, but they don't know why it's too hard.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And the reasons can be hugely varied between, like, oh, it's just this one boss ability to, like, oh, you know, the entire way you're scaling spell damage is incorrect or, you know, random stuff like that.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So there's all sorts of things.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And it's always just, you know, can we tease out what exactly it is that people are running into that's the most, you know, that's the reason for the thing they're finding hard.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So I think there was a variety of changes.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So one of them was, like, you know, the map change where, you know, you can see what's out there so you know what to find.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
A lot of it was down to, you know, more specific item drops around the place.

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Then there were things like the flask change.

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So the flask change was pretty big, I think, because that one really was, like, people dying because they were fumbling their flasks.

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But it took quite a while to identify that that was, like, an issue.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like, we knew that I, we kind of knew that we weren't happy with flasks, but we hadn't, I don't think I'd really appreciated the degree to which a new player really did struggle with them.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So that's another one of those things.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But, I mean, look, it's just, it's all over the place.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And it's, like, the devil's in the details, really.

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because even something like just the exact specifics of the passive tree, even for a new player, even if they're not, like, going deep on it, like, it can actually be worse for new players.

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Because a new player will pick something that's weak without realizing it.

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And so you need to make sure that everything on there is reasonable.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So there's quite a lot sort of, like, as I said, it really all comes down to those details that make sure that the game is feeling right.

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And I think that without doing a lot of those tests, it would have been very hard to appreciate some of those problems.

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Because you just don't, you know, when you're playing yourself, there's actually, like, a tendency where you'll always pick the stuff you kind of know is good subconsciously.

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So I actually have, like, a thing when I'm playing now where often I'm, like, okay, I'm going to pick what I want and then I'm going to do the opposite of that.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Like, in order to kind of force myself, in order to, like, force myself down the kind of, like, the not golden path of, like, what if you were the, what if I picked the worst choice every time?

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
For, like, what are you doing?

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How can I make sure that that's, like, not too terrible?

191
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So that's kind of another thing you kind of have to make sure that you're doing as well.

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Definitely.

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I have two follow-ups from that question.

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:33,000
First, and I don't want you to commit to a release cadence or anything, but once we go into early access, do you see the team making large balance changes pretty quickly?

195
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Kind of like Path of Exile 1, I'm notorious for going into the freaking ancient history of PvE 1 and seeing that when it first released, weekly updates.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Going in, making huge balance changes, wild swings back and forth, passive tree resets every, like, 11 days and the like.

197
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Do you see that happening with early access, given how much larger scale it seems it's going to be?

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Or is it going to be more stretched out?

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Maybe a month, two months, three months?

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well, so I think that there's going to be a couple of different things, depending on what type of thing we're talking about here.

201
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So for balance changes, I have absolutely no doubt that in that first week we're going to be just doing a storm of crazy things.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You know, just because, like, there'll be, I mean, look, there's going to be cases where, like, people just haven't tested bosses with certain builds and things like that, right?

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like, especially in the endgame, which has had, you know, less testing, obviously, than the start of the game.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So there's going to just be things where it's like someone will be like, oh, this boss is just impossible with minions.

205
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And, like, someone probably did test it with minions at some point to make sure the AI is good, but there probably wasn't, like, a really, you know, like, is this actually easy enough?

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Like, that kind of stuff.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Like, you'll get changes like that.

208
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And I'm sure there'll just be cases where, you know, we need to make those kinds of changes.

209
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So the other thing that's going to be, I'm sure, is just lots of, like, someone finds something that's just, like, not just busted in a normal way things are allowed to be busted, but, like, busted in a completely ridiculous way that just can't be allowed to stand.

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sure that will happen.

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And as long as we can fix that stuff fast enough, I think that we might have to do a few things like that.

212
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But ideally we don't.

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But, you know, we'll see how that goes.

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So I'm sure on the first week there'll just be lots of that stuff.

215
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But if you're talking about, like, larger content inclusions, like we're talking about, like, new classes and, like, more sort of content type things, I suspect that we'll probably batch those up into, like, a larger cycle.

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Probably, you know, probably, like, I mean, we were thinking, like, two months, it might end up being three.

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Like, I'm not entirely certain.

218
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We'll kind of, like, work that out when we go there.

219
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The funny thing is, is, like, so, like, months ago we had plans for what we wanted to do immediately after release.

220
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But as you get closer to release, like, everything just falls apart and you kind of have to be like, okay, after release we'll just have to take stock and see where we are.

221
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because, you know, like, no contact survives.

222
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Sorry, no plan survives contact with the enemy, as they say.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So we have to, we'll just have to sort of reassess and see what's going on at that point.

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But effectively, yeah, we'll probably do larger, like, larger updates.

225
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Just because I think, you know, in order to actually get good testing for something, you have to get enough players back to actually test it substantially.

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And people certainly are much more willing to come back for a larger update than they are for a smaller one.

227
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So I think that that's kind of important.

228
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We actually noticed in POE 1 when we were doing the weekly updates that, yeah, we didn't really see, like, a lot of people come back for them.

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Like, the people who were playing were really happy.

230
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But the people who weren't playing kind of weren't, it wasn't rising to the level of them actually coming back.

231
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So I think it's better to make sure that if you've got a new update for, even in early access, you want to make sure there's enough to kind of sustain it.

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But of course, that doesn't mean that we're not going to fix all the, like, you know, random small issues that, like, anything that doesn't, like, that wouldn't be an attractive thing for someone to come back for, you might as well just put it in immediately.

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Because, like, you know, that's just, like, bug fixes and just little balance changes.

234
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Because it's not, like, a big deal anyway.

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So you might as well just throw it in there.

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Definitely.

237
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Now, I have to ask, because I have been yearning ever since I saw it at Exile Con 2023, the druid, the bear form.

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Is that the reason the druid is delayed?

239
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Because it's got crazy animation problems with WASD?

240
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Or is it just the final bit of polish on the third form?

241
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
No, no, it's not that.

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's just literally that, you know, we had to pick something.

243
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We had to pick, like, you know, when we were slimming down for early access a little bit, because as I said, we were going to have eight.

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
When we're slimming down, we're like, look, unfortunately, the druid is going to have to be on the chopping block for now.

245
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And, you know, it was really sad, but we just had to pick our battles.

246
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And, like, I have no doubt that that'll be one of the next ones that comes out.

247
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And, yeah, and the reason ultimately is that making a new form for the druid just is a lot of work.

248
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
One of the forms wasn't done.

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We looked at the amount of work it would take to get the druid over the line, and we're just like, look, if we can not have that.

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Especially because when it comes to the stuff, it's like, if you're talking about adding, like, a new animal form, that's, like, work that could go into, like, making a new boss fight or something like that.

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And so, because, you know, it's the same kind of, like, it's the animation team, ultimately.

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You have to do, like, a bunch of work to do that stuff.

253
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You know, rigging or just all that stuff has to happen.

254
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So it isn't just the sort of skills pipeline, as we might call it, that has to be worrying about that.

255
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's also the, you know, the kind of the animation team who work on that stuff.

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So, yeah, when we look at that, it's just like, look, if we cut this, it's going to add more content elsewhere versus if we cut this other class where it wouldn't really so much.

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So that's kind of how those decisions get made.

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Right, right.

259
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That makes total sense.

260
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Now, I have two very quick ascendancy questions for you, and then we'll move into classes themselves.

261
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
First, last time we spoke, or when we spoke in March, I tried to get some ascendancy details out of you, and you said you were working on a broken sorceress ascendancy.

262
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You didn't know if it was going to make it into the game.

263
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Did it make it into the game, or are we not seeing it?

264
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah, so that was the chronomancer, the, like, time stuff and everything.

265
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Like, I just, I mean, the moment you tell me we can, like, you know, the moment we're like, oh, we want to be able to stop time, it's like immediately, you know, that's, how do you make that an auto-P?

266
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So, you know, yeah, it was absolutely that.

267
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's very fun to use.

268
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, it's just really cool.

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Awesome.

270
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Glad to hear it made it into the game.

271
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And then the other ascendancy question, can you change ascendancies in PUE 2?

272
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So, you actually can't right now.

273
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The, I actually made, I think I did another interview recently where I thought that we could, but I believe that you can't at the moment.

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll, there's probably more discussion to have about that.

275
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I do know that, like, certainly some designers are very keen to be that a locked choice.

276
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So, you know, we'll talk about that more, we'll see how that goes.

277
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But at the moment, you can't, and so that'll be how it goes into early access anyway.

278
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Okay, so for the foreseeable future, once you pick an ascendancy.

279
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I mean, not necessarily.

280
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Well, I mean, we'll, as I said, we'll talk about this more, but, you know, for the moment at least, you can't change them.

281
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay, sounds great.

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Now, classes, just broad questions about the classes for me.

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So, you've talked about the monk having the highest satisfaction score for everyone who's tested.

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Which class has the lowest satisfaction score, and what are you doing to perhaps bring it up, if anything?

285
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay.

286
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So, the one thing to say is that the difference between these is not, like, super high.

287
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But the lowest one on that survey that we were referring to was actually the Sorceress, funnily enough.

288
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Really?

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And I think that the reason, yeah, I think that the reason for it is just because in the skill set, there's not, like, quite as much combo stuff as what some of the other classes have.

290
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And so we actually, after that point, we did work a bit on that and try to sort of improve, make a few more of those things sort of work together a little bit.

291
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But I think there's a little bit more work to do.

292
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I think that what I've heard some people say about the Sorceress is it's a little bit more in the POE1 direction of, like, there's less kind of, like, cross, like, less cross-element combinations than what some of the other classes have.

293
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Like, so therefore, like, if you do pick that class, like, there will probably be more situations where it's, like, there's less, like, you're probably going to use less skills overall than other classes.

294
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Or rather, it's not so much that you will use that, but, like, you won't be forced into as much using more variety.

295
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So I think that's something we can still improve by just adding more synergies between the elements.

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But that's at least my understanding of probably why I think that's the case.

297
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But as I said, we've already made some changes since the point when we did that survey.

298
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So I think that it already is, you know, like, somewhat improved already by that.

299
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But, yeah, that was the thing.

300
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But, I mean, as I said, we're talking, like, you know, 0.1 of a...

301
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Like, out of five stars, it's, like, 0.1 of a star lower than the others.

302
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And, like, when you sort of dig into it, it's, like, you know, yeah, yeah.

303
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But, I mean, as I said, I think that's at least my reason for, like, for why I think the source was like that.

304
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But, yeah, that's kind of, you know, as I said, we can always improve that.

305
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And I think we have been as well.

306
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah.

307
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Awesome.

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Just wanted to hear.

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I thought it would be a curious question.

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Now, this one, I don't know if you can answer it or not.

311
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But everyone knows there's a monk in Path of Exile 2.

312
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Monks use quarterstaffs.

313
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Monks use their fists a little bit with finishers and, you know, mobility skills.

314
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Are there any unarmed combat support options?

315
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Is the default attack supportable with your fist?

316
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Can you make something busted with it?

317
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Is that a thing in Pee-wee 2 right now?

318
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Or...

319
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So, I believe that default attack is supportable.

320
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm, like, 99% certain of that.

321
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But I haven't actually...

322
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I have to admit, I haven't actually seen that user interface myself because I haven't made an unarmed build.

323
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There is a plan.

324
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There is a plan for a bunch of unarmed build support.

325
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But it actually did get cut for early access for the time being.

326
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So, unfortunately, I can say that facebreakers will not make it in to early access.

327
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But there is...

328
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We do have a plan for it.

329
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There is, like, a whole thing that's going to support that with other stuff.

330
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
One of the reasons for that, actually, is that it would require making unarmed versions of a ton of skills, like animations.

331
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, okay.

332
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So, there's actually...

333
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It ended up being cut just for that reason alone.

334
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Like, it was just a bunch of animation work that we ended up not having time for.

335
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And, effectively, you're talking about a bunch of animation work that's just to support that one unique.

336
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Because, like, that unique really is, like, kind of the key to being able to make unarmed damage, like, actually decent.

337
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There were a couple of other things as well that were sort of intended for unarmed things.

338
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But, yeah, we're not going to do it for now.

339
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But it'll come in the future.

340
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We'll get to the point where you can do that.

341
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay.

342
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Is facebreakers still a pair of gloves in Pee-wee 2?

343
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah, yeah, it is.

344
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It is?

345
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay.

346
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
All right.

347
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Cool.

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,000
All right.

349
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
This is a fun one just for you, Jonathan.

350
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What is your favorite skill to use in Path of Exile 2 right now?

351
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I know you're a mercenary fan.

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You're playing through as the mercenary right now.

353
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Is it on the Merc or something else?

354
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That is really tricky.

355
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Look, I mean, if we're talking about the Merc, then my favorite thing is definitely the ice wall.

356
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The shot, what's it called?

357
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I can't remember even the name of it.

358
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But it's the one that fires a shot and then makes, like, two diagonal ice walls that come out.

359
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And then following up with the fragmentation rounds to explode them.

360
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Like, I just love that combo.

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It just feels really satisfying to me.

362
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But, you know, it's like, obviously, like, you know, every class there's interesting stuff.

363
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Like, on the monk, it's probably the bell.

364
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Like, I just love that bell.

365
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There's so many little things about its design.

366
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And, you know, it's just a fun skill.

367
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Like, I just love that kind of thing.

368
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So, you know, those are definitely up there for two of my favorites.

369
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But, I mean, you know, there's always new stuff.

370
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
There's lots of cool things, right?

371
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's just the kind of stuff that I like to do.

372
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The bell is incredible.

373
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And you guys even snuck a showcase of it with a crossbow rapid shot.

374
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes.

375
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes.

376
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes.

377
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That was so good.

378
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Just to give just a hint to the idea that there might be some pretty interesting ways that you can do some pretty cool stuff.

379
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh, definitely.

380
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
All right.

381
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Rapid fire question here.

382
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Can we use the weapon swap system passive skills to allocate keystones?

383
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Or can they only allocate notables and travel notes?

384
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So you can't do keystones.

385
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But I actually do have some interesting stuff to talk about with this.

386
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Because we were originally going to allow that.

387
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But then...

388
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So the skill that actually originally was like that completely broke this.

389
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That we realized like this was going to be like not okay.

390
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Was Necromantic Aegis funnily enough.

391
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Which now for anyone who hasn't played P.O.E. 1.

392
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Effectively what this does is it makes it so the stats from your shield are transferred onto your minions.

393
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But when you've got weapon swap involved where like...

394
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Like if you can turn that on and off...

395
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It caused...

396
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The specific details of this are kind of complicated.

397
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But it caused a lot of chaos in like how the stat system works.

398
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And like how the minions would have to work.

399
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And like the snapshotting of this.

400
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And like just a whole lot of details around that were very complicated.

401
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And then at some point while we were discussing that...

402
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Because you know we kind of were like okay how are we going to even implement this?

403
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It was like a whole thing.

404
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Then we're like well hang on.

405
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Like is it even okay for other keystones anyway?

406
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Like when you really come right down to it.

407
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Like is chaos inoculation really okay if you can turn it on and off?

408
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Like it's kind of supposed to be this like massive downside.

409
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And like if you can just like...

410
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You know like it's kind of like we're kind of thinking maybe it wasn't okay.

411
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And then we sort of made the decision.

412
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You know what?

413
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Maybe keystones should actually be not swappable like that.

414
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Just because of the type of...

415
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I think that might be a balance problem too far even for us.

416
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Like even as far as we're willing to like accept a lot of these kinds of problems.

417
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Like I think that might even be a bridge too far even for us.

418
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So yeah we decided not to allow it.

419
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And that's what we're going with for now anyway.

420
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah you knew people were already theorycrafting ways to like get the perfect keystones on their side.

421
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Oh yeah.

422
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Right right right.

423
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That's good.

424
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Another rapid fire.

425
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If you know off the top of your head how many passive points are there in total?

426
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Because people are already looking at the tree and trying to path through it right now.

427
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I believe it's 122 is the final count.

428
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And once you get all of the optional skill books and stuff like that.

429
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Okay awesome.

430
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Another rapid fire.

431
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
This is a spicy one though.

432
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Are you able to do a one button respec if you have enough gold or if you pay a premium?

433
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Or is it one note at a time?

434
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You will have to do one note at a time.

435
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And like the thing is I mean yeah I guess I can see why people would want that.

436
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But generally speaking that's not the kind of behavior really encouraging right?

437
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Like we want you to actually be changing your build from one to the other.

438
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So yeah there's just a one note at a time.

439
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I mean look it won't take you too long right?

440
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You can click 100 times even if you're level 100.

441
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Like it's not too bad.

442
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I know.

443
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I know it won't.

444
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I get it.

445
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I totally get it.

446
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Another one.

447
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So we've seen this key term overflow a few times.

448
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And some people are wondering how it works.

449
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Could you explain how it works?

450
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah so anytime you've got something that says overflow it means that you're able to overcap that resource by up to double.

451
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So effectively overflow just means yeah like if it's leech or if it's like you know any other kind of thing that gives you back life or mana or shield or whatever it is.

452
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It basically just means yeah you can get back up to double of that resource.

453
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Okay awesome.

454
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That makes sense even to me and I'm pretty simple minded about these mechanical sort of things.

455
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Awesome thank you.

456
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
All right another rapid fire.

457
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Can you use skills granted by ascendancies in meta gems like cast on shock?

458
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
No you can't.

459
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So when you get one of those ascendancy skills they effectively just appear in your skill screen.

460
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Like they're not a gem.

461
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
They're just kind of like there and locked in by that.

462
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So because you can't take them out and put them somewhere else you can't put them in a meta gem.

463
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Okay.

464
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And then meta gems.

465
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Can you use multiple of the same meta gem?

466
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I know you can't repeat supports but can you have two cast on ignites in your build?

467
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You absolutely can.

468
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You absolutely can.

469
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But of course you'll have to pay the spirit cost for both of them.

470
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So you know that's that's how that's balanced.

471
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So that's why it's fine.

472
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Okay perfect.

473
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah you guys released a teaser yesterday.

474
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm not sure if you saw a scepter minion ascendancy or not ascendancy.

475
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

476
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh the second scepter that looked like a mirror tier item which was just awesome to see.

477
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
All right now we're going to move on from classes and we're going to talk a little bit about combat.

478
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So when I played Path of Exile 2 the Draven fight and the Executioner fight hard locked me for combined about four hours.

479
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What right now do you think is the hardest boss fight in Path of Exile 2's campaign?

480
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Not the end game but the campaign itself.

481
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And do you think it potentially is going to hard lock a lot of players if they're stubborn and they get that Elden Ring mindset where they're just like I'm just going in over and over.

482
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm not stopping until it hits zero.

483
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Well so we've definitely tried to like improve the issues that we had with that in that one.

484
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But what I would say is that the like the further you go into the game the less kind of like of the feedback we've been able to address overall.

485
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Just because you know if there's less of it right like as you go further.

486
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And so effectively what that means is that I have no doubt that if there's a boss that's going to hard lock people it's almost certainly going to be in Act 3 I would say.

487
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Something like that.

488
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But I mean on the same time like ideally the hardest bosses are later in the game.

489
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Like that's kind of what you want in some sense.

490
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So yeah like I mean look some of those fights are pretty hard.

491
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I don't know that there's one that I'd point to as like this is the hard one really.

492
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean as I said we kind of try to make sure that they're all kind of a relatively even keel.

493
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Or rather slowly increasing as you kind of go through.

494
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So yeah my hope would be that the Act 3 end boss is one that people will find the hardest.

495
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You know and then ideally the second time through it's even harder again.

496
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So but we'll see how it goes.

497
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And as I said as you now know right like if you go around the rest of the areas you'll find other stuff.

498
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You'll find more items and so on and that'll definitely help you.

499
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And if you come back you'll be you'll definitely do a lot better.

500
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Question on bosses in regular versus ruthless and not ruthless cruel.

501
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Do they have new abilities in cruel or are they the same just a little buffed with damage points?

502
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So usually they don't have like completely new abilities.

503
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Although I think that in some cases there might be a little bit of that.

504
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But usually what it is it's kind of tweaking the parameters or the AI or the radii and like things like that.

505
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Just like things about them.

506
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And it makes skills feel dangerous in new ways quite a lot of the time just because you know like a skill can be feel very differently just by you know just by changing where it is you go.

507
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So the same is true in maps as well where once again you've got like you know we have to like we have to make sure that some of these bosses that were balanced for people who are you know level 10 or something are now able to feel like their challenges in the end game.

508
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So effectively we have to do something about them.

509
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
We can't just leave them as they are.

510
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There has to be tweaks.

511
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And so yeah a lot of those changes effectively just get made to make them and they make the bosses feel quite different.

512
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The other thing as well that you have in cruel is that there are just monster types that have been shifted around and things like that.

513
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So area the combat in areas can feel a little different as well like in some cases.

514
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So there's just little fun details like that that can vary things up and just vary the experience up a little bit.

515
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Awesome.

516
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Now one more combat monster related question and it's revisiting a favorite topic of the Path of Exile community.

517
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Rare monster modifiers.

518
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We haven't seen a lot of that about in Path of Exile 2 in the past little while.

519
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
We've seen some of it in the playthroughs.

520
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Is that philosophy the same as in Path of Exile 1 or are we expecting to see 3, 4 mod rare monsters?

521
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And how do you keep the monster's identity when you add a whole bunch of modifiers to it?

522
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Because all these monsters, they're unique fights in and of themselves, right?

523
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So how do you keep that clean?

524
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
There's actually been quite a lot of specific work on rare monsters that I don't think we've talked about to anyone yet actually.

525
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And it's probably quite interesting.

526
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So the first thing I will say about it is that we realized a while ago that it's actually like not every monster type makes sense as a rare.

527
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Like if you just have a rare zombie, it's just kind of like it's not a good fight.

528
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So we actually decided, hey, you know what?

529
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
We're going to pick monsters that are going to be ones that can be rare.

530
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And bear in mind, many of them can.

531
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And then what we'll also do is if there are monsters that don't work well as rares,

532
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
maybe there's mechanic changes we can do for rare versions of that monster that could improve that.

533
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So then what we started to do is we're like, oh, you know what we're going to do?

534
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We're actually going to split out the monster types for monsters and then the rare version of that monster.

535
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And then we're actually going to do specific balance for the rares of those monsters.

536
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And that actually matters as well because there are mods that can go on certain monster types that like just completely blow up the life to unreasonable levels and things like that.

537
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Like there are actually cases where now that we've actually got the ability to do specific balance for a rare of a given monster type,

538
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
we can actually tune that difficulty to make that much better.

539
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
And so they'll get extra.

540
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
They'll actually get extra abilities in some cases just because they're a rare.

541
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Like, I mean, as a random example, there are like the very first monster in the first area.

542
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So after the zombie, you've got the quill crab, which is these little things that shoot little spikes.

543
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And they also appear later on in the hunting grounds as like a poison version of those.

544
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And I believe if those are rare, and I think I'm getting this right, then they immediately get a different way that the spikes work.

545
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And I'm trying to remember the exact details of this, but it's like they land in the ground and explode afterwards or something like that.

546
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
There's like some little thing that sort of happens.

547
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So effectively, it's like there's like little specific things that we can do.

548
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And so that stuff, I think, helps a lot.

549
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And look, I'm sure we're going to do more of this like after the early access is launched as well, like more things like that.

550
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But it really upgraded the rare fights quite a lot to be able to do that specific balance.

551
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And then, of course, you also have the mods.

552
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And once again, we're doing a whole pass on mods and trying to make them a lot better.

553
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I mean, look, there's even more we can add here, I'm sure.

554
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But trying to make sure that each of the rare mods that we add, like, makes sense for the monster.

555
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,000
We make sure that the rare mods, like, there are pulls and tags so that, like, you don't necessarily get every single mod and every single monster to kind of make sure that they make sense and actually have a reasonable fight.

556
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And I don't even know if this got done, but there was talk at one point about having a, for each rare, once again, I don't know if this actually got implemented or not.

557
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But we were talking about having it so that for each monster, we make sure that at least one fun mod goes on the monster to kind of make it have like a, by what I mean by that is like we look at each monster type.

558
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We're like, OK, here's a set of different mods that are going to make it so that the fight has some kind of interest to it.

559
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
We make sure the first step is like put one of those on it.

560
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And then after that, then we can kind of be more random with what the rest of the mods are and things like that.

561
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So, yeah, there was actually quite a lot of balance stuff that went into that.

562
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And there's more to come, but I think that the rare fights you will find are significantly more interesting in POE 2 than they were in POE 1 because of all the specific attention that they had.

563
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
They definitely sound like everybody's freaking out.

564
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That sounds amazing, especially that first system of just the monsters changing implicitly if they're rare versus if magic or normal.

565
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That's a great answer.

566
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Can you answer if Soul Eater is in Path of Exile 2?

567
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I actually don't know the answer to that.

568
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You'd have to ask Mark that one.

569
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So he's the one who's been setting up all that stuff.

570
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And so I actually don't know.

571
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I would have to go check with him on that one.

572
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,000
All right.

573
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Lovely.

574
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Love the answer, man.

575
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
OK, now we got a bulky section on endgame that I want to dive into here.

576
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I want to start with, again, another infamous Path of Exile problem that we've experienced in Path of Exile 1.

577
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And I think it's one of the reasons you designed Path of Exile 2 in its endgame.

578
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,000
One-shots.

579
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
How are one-shots in endgame looking right now?

580
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm not talking about bosses using huge abilities and obviously one-shotting you.

581
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But I'm just talking about randomly mapping your mediocre defenses and you just get one shot out of the blue.

582
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Is that happening in testing or is that avoided for the most part?

583
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, it's definitely happening at the moment.

584
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And that's because we just haven't finished the balance of a lot of monsters.

585
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And it's one of those things that's actually really hard to completely root out because there are a lot of attacks that some people, depending on your play style, just might not get hit by.

586
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And obviously, you know, when the balance people do their initial balance, they try to get it right.

587
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But it's one of those things that's just easy to miss.

588
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And so I have no doubt that at the start of early access, there will be cases where some monsters are just unfair.

589
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And, you know, that will happen.

590
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I mean, like when we were doing the beta test, there were these like spiders that were just like so nasty.

591
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And like we looked at the damage.

592
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I don't remember exactly why this occurred, but it was just like, oh, it's literally doing 10 times the damage it was supposed to be doing.

593
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Right. And like someone just made a typo.

594
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And yet, like we played a bunch of times and like none of the people that were testing before we did a beta noticed the fact that that was happening.

595
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Right. They just managed to avoid it all the time.

596
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
They only got hit by one of the bits or, you know, something like that.

597
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And so, you know, we just missed it.

598
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And look, I'm sure that's going to happen.

599
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Right. Like there will be some rough edges like that.

600
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
But, you know, well, as soon as we hear about them, we will do our best to fix them.

601
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But look, we're trying to root out all that stuff as much as we can at the moment.

602
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And, you know, hopefully the players don't experience too much of that.

603
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But yeah, I'm sure it'll happen.

604
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But yeah, look, we don't want people to be just like randomly out of nowhere, just dying for nothing.

605
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So, yeah, that's something we'll just have to make sure we're addressing as we get more balance testing.

606
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Right. The term I hear a lot from people, especially who went to the recent event in L.A., is war of attrition.

607
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That's what it feels like in Acts 1, 2 and 3.

608
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So there's nothing really instant happening.

609
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You're fighting against monsters.

610
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
They're draining you down.

611
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You're draining them down.

612
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And it's a war between you two.

613
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So there's no instant one shots really happening unless it really is your fault.

614
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That's what I heard from like Big Ducks.

615
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
He said, if I died, it was my fault.

616
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I felt good about that.

617
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I love that feeling.

618
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Well, that is the goal for sure, to make it feel that way.

619
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay.

620
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And it sounds like the deadliness is on a bi-monster level.

621
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And a lot of people are curious.

622
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I think Mark said in the endgame presentation that every map is fully random at endgame.

623
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
All monster types, no matter a biome.

624
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Is there anything that determines?

625
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Oh, so there actually is a one monster, I believe, or at least a type of...

626
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
There will be one pack in the map that's always there, but all the rest of them are random.

627
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,000
The kind of main point we were trying to make with that is that in PeeWee 2, we pretty much all monsters...

628
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I mean, look, there are some monsters that are just like swarmy little things that don't really do anything.

629
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But for the most part, monsters all have some kind of ability or mechanical interesting thing going on with it.

630
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And so in endgame, it really is the fact that you've got the combination of all those different types that really makes the combat interesting.

631
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Yeah.

632
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And you kind of never really know what you're going to get.

633
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And so, I mean, look, PeeWee 1 does have that effectively the same idea going on.

634
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It's just that so few of the monsters in PeeWee 1 actually have different mechanics, right?

635
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Sure, one in every five might do, but in PeeWee 2, it's like there are so many more things going on.

636
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
They have movement skills and just random abilities and things like that.

637
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, there's just a lot going on with them.

638
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So, yeah, it's the combination of that that really introduces that stuff.

639
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Perfect.

640
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
No, I love that.

641
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I love that there's a little bit of a theme that's there as you're hunting these different biomes and mats, and then the rest is random.

642
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Right.

643
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But the thing is, you're still going to get some pretty out-of-place stuff.

644
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I know I went into a city map the other day, and there's a gorilla attacking me.

645
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'm like, what the hell is this guy doing here?

646
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But, you know, the endgame is like that.

647
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Are the bosses the same for every map?

648
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm sure they are.

649
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Like, you're not going to get a gorilla boss in the city.

650
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah.

651
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

652
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So, the bosses are picked for the map if they spawn.

653
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Later on, we're talking about making it so that they're different.

654
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Even within one map, we might have a couple of different bosses that can spawn there.

655
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But we'll kind of have to see how we go about that.

656
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It does take a bit of work, and so we haven't done that yet.

657
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And it kind of depends a bit on how many maps there are versus how many bosses and that kind of stuff.

658
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So, that can be fun, too.

659
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Oh, that sounds awesome.

660
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Sounds like some people would just get shocked as they walk in.

661
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
That's how I expect to be when I walk into the pinnacle boss, whoever it is, for the first time.

662
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I expect to just get, like, Cirrus die-beamed.

663
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And it's like, oh, all right, well, got to build up defenses better.

664
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I can't wait for that.

665
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
On that note, too, all the boss arenas look like they have so much detail within them.

666
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And they're so distinct from their actual arenas from the campaign.

667
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And the example I saw that stuck out to me was the Colossus is, like, now in the heart of a volcano.

668
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Is the level of detail and distinction there for a lot of the boss fights?

669
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yeah, so effectively we're trying to make it so that, like, ideally when we're using a boss in maps, we can put it in a different context so that it feels like a different fight.

670
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And that, like, yeah, I mean, look, we have to definitely reuse certain components of the arena because often there's arena mechanics that we have to make sure are there.

671
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But even just the feel of the arena that can make it feel quite different.

672
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Like, for example, if you're talking about something like the Carrion Crone who's just in the second area, she's in a much bigger arena when you fight her in maps.

673
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And she also, like, all of her AOE abilities have been, like, ramped up so that they, like, have targeted a much bigger area.

674
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And things like the way the wolf's spawning, that's, like, a different pattern.

675
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
There's more of them and stuff like that.

676
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So effectively, like, the fight actually feels quite a lot more advanced when you fight it in maps for that reason just because the arena's different.

677
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And, like, the placement of all of the markers that the designers use to, like, you know, configure all that stuff.

678
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Like, there's a lot more that's gone on to that.

679
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So effectively, that can make the recontextualize the fight in quite a cool way.

680
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Oh, that just sounds so exciting.

681
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
How many of these are we getting on launch?

682
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Is it around 50?

683
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yeah, so the 50 bosses.

684
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Like, I mean, all the bosses that you have through campaign are in endgame in some way.

685
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So it's just a question of whereabouts, how we use them, and so on.

686
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But, of course, then there's also the bosses that are in endgame that aren't in the campaign as well.

687
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So, you know, there's quite a bit of that, too.

688
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah, the secret pinnacle that I'm going to try to get you to leak at some point during this interview.

689
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You'll have to wait.

690
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I definitely won't be leaking that one.

691
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Okay.

692
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
All right.

693
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Next question also on endgame.

694
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So previously, I think earlier this year in an interview, you mentioned that once you get to endgame, about a third of the loot will come from pack monsters, a third will come from special mechanics, and a third will come from bosses and maps.

695
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Now with bosses only being in every four maps on average, is that philosophy still the same, or has that shifted a little bit?

696
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah, so that definitely has shifted due to the change to the way the mapping endgame worked.

697
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So, I mean, this was always a struggle, right?

698
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Because the real thing wasn't so much the amount of loot, but the amount of time you're spending on things.

699
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And I think that having to spend one third of your time, if you're not interested in doing boss fighting right now, is a little bit high and definitely wasn't working.

700
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So I really like, I mean, no, we like to give players choice about what type of content they can fight, and we realized that bossing was also one of those type of things, right?

701
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Like, do you want to do bossing or don't you?

702
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So, yeah, I think that the balance of that is a lot better now.

703
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And I honestly don't know what the percentage would be now that you sort of have control over it at this point.

704
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But effectively, yeah, like that has definitely changed around due to that.

705
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Okay.

706
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And in testing, how is pack difficulty versus boss difficulty?

707
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Are bosses just way harder?

708
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Like, I know a lot of people say, like, oh, I want to chill when I'm fighting packs.

709
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And then when bosses, they can be really intense.

710
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Is it kind of that?

711
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Yeah, exactly.

712
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And look, the big reason for making the change of not having a boss in every map area was literally for this, right?

713
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,000
To make it so that we can make the bosses actually hard relative to, you know, relative to the pack difficulty.

714
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Because that's what sort of, you know, that sort of maintains the integrity of the combat system, if you will.

715
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Because, like, that's where you really have to get into the detail, like, really concentrating and, like, actually using all your abilities to the maximum.

716
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Whereas pack clearing, you know, you can chill out a little bit more.

717
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But that being said, we still want you to run into rares occasionally that are, like, crazy.

718
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So, you know, you still want that.

719
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But they're not going to be as crazy as the Unix are.

720
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Okay. Awesome.

721
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Rapid fire question on Endgame.

722
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Why does the Waystone or map opening UI still have four slots?

723
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Is that intentional?

724
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Is there something that hasn't been revealed?

725
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So, we actually had four slots when we started PeeWee 1 as well, even though we had no idea what we were going to use that for.

726
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So, it's just like one of those things.

727
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's just like you put it in there.

728
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's like, you know, maybe we'll use this one day.

729
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So, you know, there's literally no other reason than that.

730
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
We've always, we had four in the back of the old days and we're going to just do it again now.

731
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Just, you know, it's a fun little thing.

732
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Look, one day I'm sure we'll find something to do for that.

733
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Okay.

734
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I love it.

735
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
No, I didn't know that about Path of Exile 1 that it was always four.

736
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

737
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That's good.

738
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
All right, another one that could be a little long.

739
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm not sure.

740
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Maybe it's a simple answer.

741
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So, it sounds like there are currently four tiers of Endgame boss or Endgame encounters.

742
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But technically, from what we saw from the Atlas passive trees, we can get plus five to those encounter levels.

743
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Is the fifth tier meaningless or is there an extra secret tier?

744
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So, what happened there is I'm a programmer, so I always count from zero.

745
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So, when I say difficulty four, it's like the first difficulty is difficulty zero.

746
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And then you've got one, two, three, four.

747
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So, there's technically five difficulty tiers there, but I referred to the top one as difficulty four.

748
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So, maybe the players will refer to that a different way than I am.

749
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
But, yeah, that's just what that is.

750
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Now, technically, it is actually possible because of the fact that the small nodes and the big nodes are the way they are.

751
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It's actually possible in some cases to cause it to be one tier even above that.

752
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But if you do that, it will not result in the difficulty being higher.

753
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That's actually kind of just a quirk of the way that the nodes are.

754
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So, that's just effectively capped in that regard, which I guess might be kind of fun to have like an extra sort of hidden thing like that.

755
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But we decided not to in the end.

756
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So, yeah, there's just the there's effectively five difficulties, four difficulties above the bottom one.

757
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah.

758
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I know you're saying that, but everybody needs to try that on launch.

759
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
OK, there's a hidden difficulty.

760
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Maybe, maybe that they don't want us to know about.

761
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I don't think so.

762
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
No, no, no, no.

763
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,000
OK.

764
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
This one might be pretty quick, too.

765
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So, how high in tier do way stones go?

766
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
We saw tier 79 in the endgame teaser.

767
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Is that?

768
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So, I mean, the way what it's supposed to be is like T15 is like it goes from T1 to T15.

769
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I think it might have been that it was listing object level there.

770
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And there might even have been some inconsistencies between different clips, depending on when they were shot.

771
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm not 100 percent sure about that.

772
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But ultimately goes from T1 to T15.

773
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
However, there is a corruption outcome that can go plus one.

774
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So, that lets you, you know, that just lets you go a little bit further.

775
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh, I love that.

776
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
With that.

777
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
OK, so it was potentially like a monkey issue.

778
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
That's what I'm going to call the inconsistencies.

779
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Yeah, sure.

780
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
If you like.

781
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
If you like.

782
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,000
OK.

783
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Awesome.

784
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
OK, well, that was it on Endgame for now.

785
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Now, I just want to go into a few general questions about the game.

786
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Some rapid fire, some a little bit longer.

787
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This first one, I'm curious, going into early access, what's one system you are hyper confident won't need further iteration?

788
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And one system you're pretty sure is going to be broken under the weight of the players and you're going to need to have a lot of iteration on?

789
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It's a really hard question.

790
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Look, I think that where I'm most happy is like all the way the skill and support system works, I think, is very solid.

791
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Like, I'm very happy with all that.

792
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I think it's just a massive improvement over how PeeWee 1 was.

793
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I would say that the stuff that's going to require a lot of variation will definitely be Endgame stuff, right?

794
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Because that's the stuff that's had the least testing from players, from betas and things like that.

795
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Look, I have no idea what kind of changes we may want to see there.

796
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm pretty confident in it, but you never know what will happen when people actually go for that.

797
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So, you know, there's a lot of stuff that could need changing there.

798
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And we'll just have to work on that as we see what the players think.

799
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But the other thing as well is that, of course, the Endgame is where, you know, there's the most, I guess, like, you have to get it right completely.

800
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Because it's like that's kind of like the final experience you're having is like playing through that content.

801
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So it's like you can have a single boss fight that's like, you know, maybe people don't like it in campaign.

802
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
That's like not a big deal.

803
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But if you're talking about this, you know, the core staple of what it is that you're doing in the Endgame, you have to make sure you get that exactly correct.

804
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And even the tiniest details can significantly affect the experience.

805
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So, you know, I'm sure there'll be a lot of tweaking there.

806
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And like some things may be just like a tiny number tweak, but it ends up being like a massive difference as far as player experience goes.

807
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So, yeah, I'm sure there'll be a lot of iteration there.

808
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Okay. Now, one system that I've had a little bit of discussion about in my community is the flask changes.

809
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Are you pretty confident in those limiting you to just having a life and mana?

810
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Or do you see yourself perhaps allowing that for a wider variety of flasks in the future if you want to reintroduce them?

811
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I do think that it is important to make it so that that is as simple as possible because it really is one of those friction points you get for new players.

812
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But I think the charm system is really where we can go wild there.

813
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And so I think if we were doing like more kind of interesting stuff or like expanding on that, I think we'd do it in the charms where, you know, we can.

814
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
That's kind of intended to be, you know, the thing that you can, you know, expand on with that stuff.

815
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I just don't want it to turn again into a situation where you feel like you have to constantly be pressing buttons like all the time in order to be able to do that stuff.

816
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Because I think that really was kind of wearing on people.

817
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And it's like if you're going to be pressing buttons, I would rather the buttons you're pressing are for using active skills rather than just using flasks.

818
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So, yeah, ideally it can sort of move some of the move some of the like physical skill off just pressing flasks buttons and move it on to using skills instead.

819
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Okay. All right.

820
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
All right. This is a tough one.

821
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Maybe. Maybe not for you.

822
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Over the past six or so years, what has been the most, the single most challenging aspect of development?

823
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I know it's broad.

824
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Yeah. So I think really the big challenge is just underestimating like the scope of what it is we set out to do.

825
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And it's one of those things where we're constantly having to, you know, it's like we have a quality level we want to hit.

826
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Yeah.

827
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And it feels like it should, it feels like it shouldn't be as difficult as it is to hit that quality.

828
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Like it just, it just really is a constant battle.

829
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah. I mean, look,

830
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I think that is difficult.

831
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I think that's why so many people are resonating with this release.

832
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's very obvious that you have hit a high quality level here.

833
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I mean, it's spread like wildfire.

834
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I saw you talking to DM and Ghazi and surprised at how many people are interested.

835
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I am having people who I haven't talked to in like a decade reaching out to me about Pee Wee 2 because they're searching and they like saw my face or something.

836
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And they're like, holy crap, there's this new game I just heard about.

837
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Like it's spreading everywhere because the quality is so,

838
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
you waited until it was ready to showcase it.

839
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Right. And it, it looks phenomenal.

840
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So, um, yeah, I mean, as I said, like just getting there has just been such a thing.

841
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Like when, when we announced in 2019,

842
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
we thought that we were going to be releasing Pee Wee 2 in like 2020 and like 2021.

843
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Like it felt like it was like two years out and, uh, you know, like it's just, but it's just, yeah, it's, it's, it's,

844
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
it's difficult, right? Like just the, yeah, I don't know.

845
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And even it's like, uh, even like, is it how long ago now I'm thinking like, so 20,

846
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
yeah, it's like, it's, it's, it, the funny thing is, is it always feels like it's two years out.

847
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Like no matter how far deep into development, like no matter how far away it is, it's always like,

848
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
cause two years feels like forever, right? Uh, two years is like forever in the future.

849
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Um, and so therefore like no matter what the scope that you think that you have is,

850
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
it's always like, Oh yeah, we can do it in that amount of time. Sure. Absolutely.

851
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Um, and so, yeah, it's just real tough, uh, you know, like, like doing that.

852
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And it feels like no matter how much experience we get, I mean, obviously, you know, Mark and I

853
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
have both been in Gantt development a long time, no matter how much experience you get,

854
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
it's like, it still feels like it's impossible to really know how long something will actually take,

855
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
uh, by the time you've, uh, by the, by the time you've, um, gone things through.

856
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So yeah, it's just, uh, it's tough. Uh, it's tough for sure. I know you said it always feels

857
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
like two years away, Jonathan, but nine days log in. Okay. We're nine days out.

858
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yep. Okay. So a few really rapid fire questions here. You guys opted in for G-Force now for PUE2.

859
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Do you know if that's going to be available for early access launch or you, I know you guys don't

860
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
have control over that, but do you know if it will be available? I believe it's supposed to be,

861
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
um, like, uh, we've been taught, we've been told it is. So, uh, you know, hopefully that all works

862
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
out and people can use that. Awesome. Now, how about the trade site on day one? Is that going

863
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
to be functional? Yeah. So we're doing everything we can to make sure that's the case. I think that

864
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
there'll be some items that maybe won't, uh, show up correctly and hopefully, like for example,

865
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
the way that, uh, skill gems are rendered is like completely changed. And, um, so I think what they're

866
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
going to do for skill gems is just like show the name of the gem and the level rather than having to work

867
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
out like all the stats and everything, how that works. And I think for something like gems,

868
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
it doesn't really matter because, um, you know, like the, there's nothing about the gem other

869
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
than just like the name of the level that actually matters as far as trade is concerned. Um, so

870
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
they're going to do their best to get everything rendered correctly, but I think it's really

871
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
important to make sure we've got trade on day one. Definitely. Oh yeah. People love trading now.

872
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
PVP. Does that exist in any form? Yeah. So you can do, uh, yeah, you can do simple jewels,

873
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
just like, uh, duels, like you could in PUE1. Um, we're not going to be doing anything more than that

874
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
for now. Um, so, uh, yeah, that's, uh, it's there, but like, we haven't done any effort

875
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
really towards it. It's just like, you know, like it just is what it is just as a fun thing.

876
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
If you want to challenge your friend and just like, you know, just do a thing that you can,

877
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
you could do that if you want. Cool. Cool. Now in the second run through the campaign,

878
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
cruel, do bosses once again, drop permanent buffs as they will on the first run through for those

879
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
optional bosses or are none of those available in the second run through? Uh, yep. So the second run

880
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
through, it definitely does have that. Um, so yeah, you're going to want to look for those as well. Um,

881
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I believe that for them, that some of them are the same and some of them are different. So, uh,

882
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
you'll, you'll have to look around through the map to see what that's going on with that.

883
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Oh, okay. Curious. Now this one is, I want to be gentle with it, but it's something that a lot of

884
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,000
people have talked about in the past. There is an MTX that is audio based that plays in towns and

885
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
everyone wants to hear the sweet songs of Camille when they go into the Clearfell encampment.

886
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Is there any way that you guys are thinking about maybe an audio slider for MTX or something like an

887
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,000
audio adjustment maybe, or is that on your radar? Um, I mean, it's something that I've heard complaints

888
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
about recently. So it's something that I, we might have to think about, but I can't say I've got a

889
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
solution for it right now. Um, by the way, just one question, speaking of audio, do you hear like a

890
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
loud beeping or is that just on my end? That is just on your end. Chat, do we hear a loud beeping?

891
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Let's see. No beeping. It's on your end. Is everything okay at the GGT office?

892
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I think it's fine. It's just coming through my headset. So, uh, I'm not sure it's good. It's

893
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
all right. It's fine. I'll just ignore it. They're telling you to not talk about the goblins.

894
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Okay. Unfortunately, I don't have a good answer for you for that, but I do understand the issue

895
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:43,000
though. Okay. Uh, now, oh, sorry. Items. So in the last time people got their hands on PeeWee 2,

896
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
we saw obviously the tiers, which you talked about and can't wait to get my hands on that.

897
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
We also saw items dropping with terms like advanced, expert, and ultimate. Are those related

898
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:01,000
to tiers or what is that? So the reason why that is, is because, um, uh, so we didn't want to release.

899
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So what we've done in PeeWee 2 is that all of the acts, they have a much more, um, uh, like the

900
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
items that you find in each act are like way more related to the content of that act. So like,

901
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
as soon as you go to the desert, you're going to be finding like all of these like Mariket themed

902
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
items and so on. So, um, for act four, uh, and five and six, we've obviously got a whole big set of

903
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
base types that are all, uh, like, you know, related to those things. And so what we did was we're

904
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
like, okay, we don't really want to like just have those dropping now because they kind of don't make

905
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
sense for the content you're in. So what we decided to do was effectively make a duplicate of the,

906
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
of the base types that goes, um, into the, uh, into the second set of difficulty, uh, in second

907
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
difficulty. And, uh, that way we can drop all of those there. And then, uh, that will mean that we

908
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
just don't have the, um, uh, we don't have that, that we, we, we, we don't have to release all that

909
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
stuff now. And then effectively at the point when we release the acts, we'll effectively also release

910
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
the base types at the same time. And those base types will get replaced by the, uh, and the art and

911
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
everything will get replaced by the, uh, the new base types that we've already, that we've already got.

912
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
So, um, yeah, that's effectively the, um, uh, what's going on with that. Uh, now an end game, um,

913
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
there are some base types that relate to just end game. I'm not a hundred percent sure exactly

914
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
what the situation is with regard to the art, uh, stuff that they've done there, but, um,

915
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
effectively by the time we're sort of completely done, uh, it should be that we're not like having

916
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
to repeat any art anywhere and all that sort of stuff. But, uh, for the time being, we've just got

917
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
the, um, they, uh, that, that going on. Oh, okay. Awesome. Now also related to items and the tiers,

918
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
obviously tier five item will have amazing mods, amazing roles, and the like,

919
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:32,000
once you identify it, what happens if you craft on it? Uh, so yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't,

920
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
it doesn't affect anything after you've identified it. So effectively, once you've

921
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
identified it, like you've seen the mods are there, then effectively it is just a regular

922
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
item as far as any other, like, just like any other item would be. Um, and that's kind of

923
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
important because it's only really in the unidentified state when you see the tier, um, after that point,

924
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
the tier, it doesn't matter anymore. Cause like the, the decision that that resulted from that

925
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
is already decided and everything's, uh, you know, everything's done.

926
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Okay. Awesome. Thanks for the question, by the way, MP that was from Empyrean.

927
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Okay. Uh, another one. So I know that you vastly increased the number of orbs that are dropping

928
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
in early game and the intent is for people to be using said orbs on crafting. Are you at all worried

929
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
about how this will affect the greater economy? If people decide to just hoard everything and try to

930
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
post it on the trading post is I'm curious about that because I, I'm going to be spamming my gear,

931
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
but I think a lot of people will be like, ah, I'll just save it to trade. You know,

932
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I think it will be fine. Um, so the nice thing about currency is that it's self-syncing, right?

933
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Like you get to actually use all that stuff and I'm pretty sure people will be using it more

934
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
because they have more. Like, I think that's just how it will work. Um, so usually speaking,

935
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
um, you don't really get hyperinflation with currency items because the way that, um, you know,

936
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
they actually have a, yeah, as I said, because they're self-syncing. Yeah. Uh, but you never know,

937
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
like we never really can tell exactly what will happen with an economy until we actually see it. Um,

938
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
but I really hope we don't have any problems from that because having the more currency in the game

939
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
just definitely makes the game significantly better to play through the game. Um, you know,

940
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm, I'm loving it. I just like the experience of doing all that stuff. So, um, yeah, I really want

941
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
to be able to keep that. And, um, the, uh, I think that just the fact that you kind of don't have,

942
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
um, the, uh, uh, the scouring orb anymore and the way that like things are always added,

943
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
like you're going to be wanting to add mods all the time. Like it's just a common thing.

944
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And there's even sort of rules, like for example, so it used to be that when you out an item,

945
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
uh, gave you a random set of mods from four to six, but now it's always four. So it's like,

946
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
there's always going to be that you want to do the out and then the exalts. Um, so like,

947
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
you know, there's just more uses for that stuff. Like the, the, the adding, uh, the adding stuff

948
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
definitely, you know, just, yeah, it happens more often. Yeah. I heard somebody got four exalted

949
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,000
orbs by the end of act one and just felt so good being able to slam their items. So yeah, I love that.

950
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Okay. Runes. I know they're a recent addition. I had a few questions about them.

951
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,000
First are all runes, just basic stats such as resistances and the like, or are there any

952
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:00,000
spicy combinations that might remind us of fan favorite ARPG maybe later down the line?

953
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So we don't have rune words. And the funny thing about that is that like,

954
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I actually had a long conversation about this because, um, you know, it's one of those things

955
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
that everyone remembers loving. But the funny thing about that is that like what they actually

956
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
remember loving was not so much the mechanic of rune words, but just the fact that all the

957
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
rune words were super OP. Um, like, uh, the rune words were just crazy powerful. And so like when

958
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
people like, Oh, I love rune words, it's like, they think it's the mechanic they liked, but no,

959
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
like that's just, it's just the items were just absolutely outrageous. Um, like, uh, yeah,

960
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,000
it's a sort of funny, funny how it was like that. Okay. But, um, what the, what I will say is that

961
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
like, so runes are intended to be the kind of simple ones that don't have a lot of, um, uh,

962
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
like, like a lot, a lot of complexity going on. So it's the sole cause that, uh, you can put in

963
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
the same sockets. Those are the ones that are intended to kind of have where there's more

964
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
complexity. There's different stats. There's different things going on with them.

965
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Okay. And with those, they're unremovable, correct? You can't take them out of gear once

966
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
you sock them in.

967
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And that's just kind of our general philosophy of, uh, the fact that we want it to most crafting to

968
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
be additive. Now we still do have some crafting things that remove mods, but, um,

969
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I guess the difference with, uh, the, uh, sockets is that every single mod that went in there,

970
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
it's like, there's no randomness to those decisions, right? Like every single thing you

971
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
put in, it's like you completely controlled that outcome. Um, so therefore we don't feel

972
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
like we have to provide a way to remove that. Cause it's like, that's entirely in your control.

973
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Whereas when you're talking about the random chance addings, like then it's like, there can

974
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
be ways that also based on random chance to be able to remove that again. And then we've

975
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
also got things like the omens that allow you to have more control over that. So like that sort

976
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
of stuff makes sense. But, um, for the, for the socketables, it's like, well, yeah, it's like you

977
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
chose to put that in. Uh, it's like, you know, I think the added philosophy works fine for that.

978
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Okay. Awesome. Now two more questions on items here really quickly. One of them is about splinter

979
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
stack size. Now I know we want to declutter the screen for path of exile to keep the focus

980
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
on combat, but it looked like from the trailer, the stack size, for example, the breach stone

981
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:01,000
is still 300. What's the design philosophy between like 300 stack size and 25 stack size.

982
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So they actually drop, uh, like in stacks. Uh, and the reason why that's important is

983
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
because it means that we can have effects that say if there's, if there's a mod that's

984
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,000
like 10 plus 10% splinters, it means that when we drop a stack of 10, that that plus 10%

985
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
can actually make it a stack of 11. Um, which, so basically it's just to give granularity so

986
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
that when we're dropping them, we actually can like, you know, have the mods could like

987
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
a plus 10% can actually be a, uh, you know, a thing that actually does something. Um, so

988
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
that's the reason why it's 300. Um, it isn't necessarily to change like the, uh,

989
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
amount of like things on the screen or the amount of, uh, or the amount of duration that

990
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
it takes to actually get to the, uh, to the boss. It's just about the granularity for mods, basically.

991
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Okay. Awesome. One more item question. And then just one final question for you. Thank

992
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
you so much for your time, Jonathan. I really appreciate it. Will there be vendor recipes

993
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
in path of exile too? And if so, any examples?

994
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So we actually decided to not do the system the same way how we did it before. So each, um,

995
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
yeah, so basically, so that we no longer have the vendor recipe, like idea as a concept where

996
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
there's just a vendor who, um, uh, we just do like any, uh, combination of items in the vendor.

997
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So the vendor, uh, that has that same UI is like for disenchanting. And then effectively what we've

998
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
done is we've tried to pull like the different vendor recipes out into like benches or like items

999
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
in the world or like, or like NPCs with specific modes or things like effectively, like all of those

1000
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
things, we want to try and make sure that they're kind of like just more discoverable than what

1001
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
they were in Peewee 1. So like what we kind of want to do is like, um, if we're going to do,

1002
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
um, like for example, the quality recipe where you had like 40% quality, you get a, um, a, a

1003
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
whetstone. Yep. Now that we've got the salvage bench, that's like a specific bench that's able to

1004
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
effectively replace the thing that that was doing, uh, by something that effectively serves the same

1005
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
function, but it's like discoverable now. Cause you've got like a bench that's dedicated to

1006
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
quality and also socket, uh, currency items. Um, where, and if we're going to do a, for example,

1007
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
a three to one recipe, there is an item, a thing you get later, which has like three, you know,

1008
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
three slots and then a bottom slot, you know, and then you click the button that like, you know,

1009
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
combines them. It's like got its own thing. So effectively it means that like, you know,

1010
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
it's like more obvious, like when there's stuff like that. And effectively for each time where

1011
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
we want to have something that's like a vendor recipe, we can sort of find a place to put it,

1012
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
like make it more thematic, like have a little UI for it. Um, you know, there's even things like,

1013
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
um, well, maybe I won't spoil the other ones, but effectively, you know, like, uh,

1014
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
but effectively whenever we're doing, uh, when we need, when we need a function like that,

1015
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I think it's cooler to have a specific user interface, a specific place, a specific NPC,

1016
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
a specific object, like something like that, that you find that, uh, that, that allows for that.

1017
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
And so it kind of gives you a hint that such a thing even exists in the first place.

1018
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And then now that you've seen that you're like, okay, what actually goes in here? Like,

1019
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
what is this for? Like, you know, then like maybe you can have like little law hints,

1020
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
things like that. Uh, you know, it just makes the whole thing a little bit more discoverable.

1021
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And I think a little bit more interesting. So that's effectively how I've replaced that system.

1022
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yeah. When, when you said that now I'm thinking that there could be nodes on the

1023
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Atlas that house systems like this little secrets where you could go and find these little crafting

1024
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
benches, which just sounds like so much fun. The, I know we talked about it earlier,

1025
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
the Atlas and the exploration aspect of it, huge W I cannot wait to go in and just explore it.

1026
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It's going to be great. Okay. Jonathan, I've got one last question for you and then we'll let you go.

1027
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Thank you so much for your time again. No problem. I want you to give me the best single reason for

1028
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,000
everyone in the chat right now, everyone watching this VOD to buy a supporter pack and log in on

1029
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
December 6th at 2 PM Eastern.

1030
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I think that really probably the main thing that you're going to love is just fighting those bosses.

1031
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
The combat with them is just like so fun. They're so varied and interesting. Like I'm just like,

1032
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
you know, there's, there's a lot of them to fight. Uh, you know, just get, you'll, if you,

1033
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
if you, if you, if you're playing December 6th, there'll be a lot of bosses to fight and I'm sure you're

1034
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
going to have a great time with them. This really is, I think one of the things we're doing the

1035
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
best out of all the things we're doing. Jonathan, will you be logging in on December 6th?

1036
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Of course. Of course. I mean, as soon as there's some kind of horrible fire with the servers,

1037
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,000
then I'll immediately have to probably deal with that instead. But, uh, you know, uh, but, uh,

1038
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
so long as there aren't any problems, I'll just get, I'm going to be playing. Absolutely.

1039
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
All right, Jonathan, man. It's been great. Every time I talk with you, it's always so smooth.

1040
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Everybody appreciates your time. Good luck the next nine days. Okay.

1041
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Thank you very much. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'll talk to you later,

1042
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
man. Great to talk to you. Oh, thank you. All right. Talk later, man. See ya. Thank you.

1043
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
All right. Log in. How did it go?

1044
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I did respect his time. I didn't want to go over. I had some other questions, but you know,

1045
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I didn't want to go too over. Okay. All right. I thought that was pretty damn good. I,

1046
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,000
we actually got some good info. The rare info, hopefully the rare info, the rare monsters

1047
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:48,000
actually sound sound legit, right? The rare monsters don't have just extra modifiers.

1048
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,000
They change and are chosen specifically by the developers to be rare. Let's go.

1049
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I think that was the coolest tidbit. I almost freaked out. And I saw somebody in the chat saying

1050
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
that Jonathan was having trouble with the glazing. Come on. The dude was, he was like trying not to

1051
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:16,000
brag when so obviously he is smashing it. I had to glaze him there. The dude is like the hardest part

1052
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
is making sure the quality is there and not knowing when the best time is here. Man.

1053
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I had to give him the props. They waited until they were ready to go before releasing the product.

1054
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
That's, that's ballsy. Okay. Right. You're supposed to just develop the product for a few years and

1055
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
then ship it out. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right guys. Okay. Did you guys enjoy the

1056
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
interview? Sorry. I have not been looking at chat. Did you enjoy it? W or L let's see.

1057
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:59,000
God tear glazing. Thank you. Bornbeard. W, W, W, W. Oh my goodness gracious. I'm sweating.

1058
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
I'm sweating a lot. I see no L's in the chat. Glaze away. I salute you.

1059
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:16,000
What do you mean? Almost 6k viewers on YouTube. What? Holy crap. We've got like 9k viewers total live.

1060
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Whoa. That's crazy guys.

1061
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Jonathan is still in the chat. I will not, I got to close discord so I don't accidentally pop in.

1062
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Also, Jonathan will be logging in with us. You guys, I all, I, I almost wanted him to say log in,

1063
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
but I wasn't going to be like, Hey, can you say log in so we can use a voice clip? Right.

1064
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I couldn't explicitly tell him to say it. Okay. He almost said log in. Okay. He said he was going to

1065
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,000
log in, but he didn't go log in. That's what I was expecting. You know, what is GeForce now? It's a

1066
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:17,000
cloud-based software that allows you to like host your computer, like use your internet to go to a

1067
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
virtual, like a different computer that's hosted somewhere else. So you don't have to have good

1068
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:31,000
graphics cards or CPUs on the like. Oh, I'm getting co-streams on Twitch. Oh, people were

1069
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
watching me on PUE too. Well, thank you everybody who was watching. I really appreciate it. I hope

1070
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:43,000
the interview was informative. I tried my best. I didn't want to go too far over. Okay. So I think

1071
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,000
that was good. I just didn't get to a few item questions and lore questions, which I know is

1072
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
going to piss off all 11 people who care about the lore of Path of Exile, but there will be

1073
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
hundreds of thousands of us once PUE2 comes out. I'm telling you, the lore is good. Okay.

1074
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Oh, wow, wow, wow. Thank you for the mods in the chat to Omega Cybers. So Shiro, I think

1075
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Volatis was there as well. Thank you very much. Shout out to you guys. No lore unsub. No, I love the

1076
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
lore. I love the lore. There are dozens of us, as I said. Calm down. I look like a tomato.

1077
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I look like a tomato. Guys, I was... I stumbled over a few words there, but you know, it happens.

1078
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I was incredibly nervous. PUE2 is number two on Steam top selling games. Let's go take the ride.

1079
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That's awesome. Do we know how they will release new content classes, just random updates? No,

1080
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:48,000
they said every two to three months is the goal. Oh, you're welcome. Yeah, it sounds like it's going

1081
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,000
to be on GeForce now, you guys, which is pretty cool. Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy. Okay, we did it.

1082
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I need to know who is editing my questions before we started the interview. That's what I really want

1083
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:09,000
to know. Do we know what happens to guilds on early access? Yeah, guilds should be in PUE2,

1084
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I believe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Join our Discord, guys. Yep, plug in the Discord. Plug in the Discord.

1085
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
We've got a big Discord, guys. Some would say it's the biggest talkative try Discord out there.

1086
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:32,000
That would be a true statement. Okay? Hey, thanks Zane and PC for becoming a... Oh my god,

1087
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
did we have a lot of gifts? Laurenco, thank you for the gifted memberships on YouTube.

1088
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:45,000
10... Oh my god, there's too many to read. There's too many to read. This kept going while I was doing

1089
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:53,000
the interview. MP posted a summary tweet. Let's go.
