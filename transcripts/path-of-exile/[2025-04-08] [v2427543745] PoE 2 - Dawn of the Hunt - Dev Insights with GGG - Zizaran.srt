1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's do my legs.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
All right.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There we go.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Audio test.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to turn you up to 120.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's test again.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Does that sound good?

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is Mark.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's see.

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Still louder.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll turn you up to 160.

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay.

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Try talking.

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How's it sound now?

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Does that sound all right?

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And how does this sound?

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is Mark again.

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We might be able to get it turned up on our end.

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, I think now is good.

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm going to try to get a...

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But I have echo when I speak, I think.

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah.

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can hear myself.

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay.

34
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I can hear myself.

35
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All right.

36
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We'll just get our audio guy to fix that.

37
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
All right.

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Can you try again now?

40
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
All right.

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello.

42
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Testing.

43
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
One, two, three.

44
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay.

45
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't think I have echo anymore.

46
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How...

47
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What's...

48
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How...

49
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm still louder than them.

50
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah.

51
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Maybe turn yourselves up a little bit.

52
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay.

53
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hey, Jenna.

54
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You able to get the...

55
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sweet.

56
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sweet.

57
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All right.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Apparently it's cranked up a bit now.

59
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is that better?

60
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
How's that chat?

61
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Is that okay?

62
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Test, test.

63
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How is this chat?

64
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How is this?

65
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A bit more.

66
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I mean, I can turn them up a little bit more.

67
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can put them up to 170.

68
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

69
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All right.

70
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Try now.

71
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
All right.

72
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Testing.

73
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
One, two, three.

74
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Is that okay?

75
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hopefully that's all right.

76
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

77
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Everybody's saying good.

78
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And my comparative audio to them is good?

79
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All right.

80
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay.

81
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Cool.

82
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Everyone's saying good.

83
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I just hope my OBS doesn't crash during this.

84
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Like, I've had some, like, OBS issues lately.

85
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay.

86
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So, hopefully not.

87
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But, yeah.

88
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm ready to start.

89
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll do just, like, a quick intro, and then we go.

90
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, but, yeah.

91
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you so much for joining me here for our podcast after the launch of Point2.

92
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is Jonathan and Neon, for those that don't know, directors of GDD.

93
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And, yeah, we're here to talk about the launch.

94
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah.

95
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I mean, well, you know, it's always good to have a chat.

96
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You know, obviously it's a bit of a contentious launch in some ways this time.

97
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of questions about that.

98
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But, you know, it's always good to have a chat.

99
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

100
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, I do have a lot of questions.

101
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, I think we'll just get right into it.

102
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Sure.

103
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A lot of people are pretty unhappy with the current state of the game, especially, like, our relative power to the monsters earlier on.

104
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And, obviously, we are finding some builds that are feeling okay and that are stronger.

105
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I'm asking, are the slower and more challenging builds the intended pace of the game?

106
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, I don't know that, once again, I mean, we get this question a lot, right, of just the, like, what is the pace of the game supposed to be?

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I honestly find it hard to answer that because of the way that, like, there isn't really a, like, an obvious way to, like, to even quantify that, given that players have so many different abilities.

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What I will make, like, all I can say is, is that if people are unhappy, then we will keep on improving things until they're not unhappy anymore.

109
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Because, ultimately, we want to get the smooth progression where, you know, you start the game, you feel weak, you get stronger, you get stronger, you get stronger, you keep on feeling stronger and stronger.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And, like, you have to have that, like, progression where, you know, you're feeling more and more powerful as you're going through.

111
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So, if you're not feeling that, then that means there's something that we have to improve and get better.

112
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Like, and so, like, it really comes down to, like, okay, if you're talking about a weaker build, like, well, what build is it?

113
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And, you know, like, then we'll be looking into that and seeing what we can do to improve it.

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Like, we just have to go through these things one at a time.

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, I think right now the problem is that it's almost every build this week for a lot of archetypes and that it's more like, it's definitely in the minority that people are like, oh, I found something that works.

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So, it's, like, almost like the reverse there.

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And I guess I'm curious, like, what amount of time are you expecting people to take going through the entire campaign or on your own test realm?

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Or, like, when you're doing test runs, how long do you take on a first campaign run?

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You know, I actually haven't measured that on the current, like, version.

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And it doesn't necessarily always work that way.

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Like, the number of times I play through the full, and when I say campaign here, I'm talking about six acts, not just three.

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah.

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Like, if you're talking about the amount of time, like, doing that, like, I might only do that, like, that full run, like, two or three times in total as we're developing a class.

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Like, much more often I'm, like, either testing this part or I'm testing that part or whatever.

126
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I honestly am not sure exactly what amount of time that that's taking.

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But, like, as I said, I don't know that, like, the time â€“ like, the thing is, the presupposition with this question is that, like, you know, that we have a goal in mind for the amount of time for the campaign.

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And the implication of that is that the campaign itself is not fun.

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But it's, like, if that's the implication, then we just want to make that fun, right?

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You know, it's, like, the campaign should be fun to play.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The amount of time it takes, to me, is not nearly as relevant as just make it fun, right?

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If you aren't having fun, we want to make sure that it is.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So, like, that's why, you know, when we're, like, okay, people are saying, like, we don't like the Act 3 areas, make those shorter.

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's, like, well, what amount of â€“ like, I don't think that quantifying that in an amount of time is the right way to look at it.

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's, like, here are some areas that are unfun.

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll make those areas fun.

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And then whatever the duration of time that that takes will not be bothering you.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And that may result in the areas becoming shorter.

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But making it shorter is not, like,

140
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
like, it isn't a time metric that we are looking at to determine whether or not the game is good.

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's, is the game good fun to play?

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, like, that, I guess, is kind of the way that I would look at things.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And that's, I think, what puts us a little bit, like, when it comes to communication with the community,

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
like, people will have their opinion about what they think is the reason that the game isn't fun.

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And they might be right or they might not be right or whatever.

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But at the end of the day, what we're looking at is just, like, okay, you're obviously having a bad time.

147
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We want to fix that.

148
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So we're going to look at, like, here â€“ like, so what we'll do is we'll be, like, okay,

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
so you're saying Act 3 isn't good.

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We'll look at Act 3.

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We'll look at the reasons why it might be bad.

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We'll fix those reasons.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And then that may or may not reduce the time.

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
In this case, it definitely will.

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Like, it's shortened it by a lot.

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But, you know, and then â€“ but to me, it's, like, the frustrating thing is when you go down a dead end

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and you're, like, okay, you know, like, this is, you know, this is bad or â€“ and then, like, you have to respawn or in the area doesn't â€“ you know, like, the area despawns and you're, like, you have to do things again.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That kind of stuff, right?

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's the stuff that people don't like to do.

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And so that's what we sort of look at.

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And so then when it comes â€“ coming back to builds again, once again, it's, like, okay, if you're not having fun with your build, then that is a problem.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We'll fix that.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But it's not like there's a correct pace for the game to be played at as such.

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We just need to make sure that you're enjoying yourself.

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, I guess a follow-up to that was I, among with many others, were not expecting a nerf to just how the campaign felt in general, right?

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
In the last interview I heard, it really sounded like the intention was to target things at the top end.

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But there were so many things that nerfed us during the campaign here.

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And a lot of â€“

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, the first â€“ the thing I would say about that â€“

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I would like to finish.

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Sure, sure.

172
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
A lot of people are really wondering about the long-term direction for the game with that in mind because they were also not expecting that.

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So a lot of people are wondering â€“

174
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, we weren't attending to the campaign, to be clear.

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That was going to be my question.

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That was not our intention.

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So we should be more powerful than we currently are during the campaign then.

178
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, that one I will have to look at specific cases, right?

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because, like, that comes down to â€“

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, so, like, we already did something about that, right, where we, like, nerfed Monster Life.

181
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And it's possible that we would have to nerf Monster Life again if that's still a problem.

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Like, that's the kind of thing that we can do.

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But the thing is, is that, like, the â€“ as I said, like, the first thing we heard when everyone was saying this, the first thing we thought was, like, what the hell?

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We didn't even nerf the campaign.

185
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Like, literally, that's what all developers were saying.

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We didn't nerf this.

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why is everyone saying we nerfed it?

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And so, like, then it's like, well, we found a few things.

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But, like, we're still looking for what those things are.

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Like, it's not always necessarily obvious with all the changes that you make and things.

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Because I can absolutely tell you that our goal here was nerf the endgame, right?

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Like, nerf the â€“ like, well, no.

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It wasn't even nerf the endgame.

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What it was was nerf the things that were trivializing the endgame before you've even managed to get the â€“ you know, like, your items and stuff like that.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Like, just the really trivial, easy shit.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like, that was our intention.

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I mean, there were some blatant fuck-ups.

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah, yeah.

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Speaking bluntly, right?

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Like, the minion change was just bad.

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And when you say the minion change, are you referring to the rare minions or are you referring to the player minions?

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Because those are both â€“

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, both of those were incredibly terrible.

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Both were just fuck-ups.

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Those were just fuck-ups.

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And the thing is, it's so easy for shit like that to slip through.

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, we have a bit of a â€“ and a lot of it is just because there's a little bit of â€“ it's early access, so we're allowed.

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But we are firing from the hip a lot here.

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And stuff like that, like, let's get it in there.

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's try it out.

212
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
See how people think.

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And if it's bad, we'll just undo it, right?

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Like, we do regress on a decent number of things in the first few days of a release.

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And so, yeah, there are some pretty blatant fuck-ups.

216
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So, yeah, that's exactly what happened with the rare minion life.

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It was like, what the â€“ why are now â€“ I don't know why it felt this way, but 100% it was the case that the minions was â€“ for some reasons, the rare minions were surviving longer than the rare often.

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And it's like, well, it doesn't â€“ they don't have anywhere near as much life as the rare.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And then, again, once people got enough AoE and all of that, it solved it.

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But it was just a bad experience.

221
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There was just nothing good about that.

222
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Right.

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I think there was definitely a compounding of a few factors that were, like, on their own relatively small.

224
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But the thing is, is that if â€“ and this is the question that I have is, is that, like, if people are still having a bad time during the campaign, if they're starting fresh now â€“

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
because bear in mind as well that people will have an experience and then will change the balance behind them and then they still remember that the experience was bad and they're not playing it again to know that it got better.

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So the thing is, if you're playing it again and still having a bad experience in the campaign, then that would be a thing where it's like, okay, well, where are the â€“

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the campaign nerfs, actually?

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Like, we have to find where they are because I don't â€“ like, I don't know that there's anything intentionally done there that we're sort of aware of left.

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I think, like, that one just means that, yeah, like â€“

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can give examples.

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There might still be issues.

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah.

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Sure, sure.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We'll go for it.

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What is it?

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What is it?

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So the number one, especially to me, most oppressive thing, is the relative speed of monsters compared to our abilities to set things up.

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Like, whenever you're talking â€“

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hang on, hang on.

240
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But that's not a thing that changed, though.

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, but that's been continuously bad.

242
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It doesn't matter if it's changed or not.

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, sure, sure, sure.

244
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But what I'm saying is that â€“ okay, but this is an example â€“

245
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, I think that has changed.

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But that's just an example of something that's bad.

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So what I'm saying is that's not a thing that changed.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, like, if you're talking about, like, is it your intention of the campaign?

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But we are weaker now, right?

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
A lot of skills â€“

251
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But if you're saying that's bad, I mean, that's a different question, right?

252
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
A lot of skills are weaker now, right?

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They were tuned down on a lot of things, and things that people are starting with weren't necessarily strong.

254
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So that relative speed of the monsters feels extra bad.

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like, you want us to set up these combos and stuff, right?

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Where we're throwing down, like, a cyclone and trying to do, like, a combo move.

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But the monsters are way too fast.

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
They're rushing us.

259
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's not even, like, the bosses are the main problem, right?

260
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Like, if you're seeing, like, clips â€“

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, so let's talk about the monster speed thing.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So one of the issues that we have is that if monsters are slower than the player, then combat is optional.

263
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like, it's just 100% the case.

264
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like, you cannot â€“ if the monsters are slow â€“ like, any time the monsters are slow in the player, then you can just run past them and they serve no â€“

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like, they don't â€“ like, effectively you can just choose whether or not to engage or not.

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And, like, I don't think that that kind of gameplay is good.

267
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Now, there will probably be some areas â€“

268
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Like, and the thing is, a lot of the time when people talk about stuff like this, it's like there'll be a few areas that are bad.

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Like, I know there are definitely a few areas where, like, too many of the monsters are fast.

270
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So the Faradon are a good example of that, where, like â€“ like, when you go to the, like, the last areas of Acts 2, like, the Faradon are just really, really fast.

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And there's kind of nothing slow in the area.

272
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And so that's an example where, like, we probably want to make some tuning in.

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I mean, to get more specific, like, I'm actually â€“ I have someone right now literally going through the areas â€“

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
all areas in the campaign and listing all the areas that have a disproportionately high number of monsters that are too swarmy or too fast.

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They're doing it literally as we speak up.

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And my intention after this is to go through â€“ and so, like â€“

277
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I mean, a good example is, like, the canopy, right?

278
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The canopy.

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The monsters are real fast.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And then not only that, you're in a ritual with them in a tight, confined space.

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And it just â€“ you end up in this kind of moving around with packs.

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So if you're not fast enough to kill everything, yeah, you just get absolutely swarmed.

283
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And, yeah.

284
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I guess I'm a little â€“

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But the thing â€“ just to follow â€“ just to continue with that, though.

286
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I just â€“ because I just want to mention that, like, one of the issues we run into is, like, people will say, oh, you know, like, things should never be faster than the player and that kind of stuff.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And it's like, well, if we did that, then the game would feel pretty lame.

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So it really is a question of, like, targeted changes, like finding where the worst things are and then solving that issue.

289
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I really disagree with that.

290
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So you were saying, like, if the monsters are slower than the player, then combat is optional.

291
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But, like, it's an ARPG.

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We want to kill the monsters.

293
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's where all the loot is.

294
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's where our XP is.

295
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Like, sure, you'll have some speedrun scenarios where people are running past them.

296
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But usually what ends up happening is that we're running past them, bunching them up in a large bunch and killing a bunch of them.

297
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And that just feels really good.

298
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's a core part of ARPGs for a lot of people.

299
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So I don't think that being faster than the monster is as bad as you think it is.

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Like, we actively want to kill monsters.

301
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That is the entire premise.

302
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, I don't necessarily disagree with you that gathering and killing is fun, right?

303
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And you should still be able to do that.

304
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But I would, as I said, I don't think anything about the fact that some monsters are faster than the player prevents that.

305
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't think you can have areas where everything is slower than the player.

306
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Like, it really isn't that great.

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
In PeeWee 1, in the distant past, we had that problem.

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And it just meant that running past monsters was the thing you did all the time.

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And then there were some changes.

310
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Like, I don't know how many years ago it was.

311
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Like, what was it?

312
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Four years or something like that?

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
When was the act one?

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Like, we made changes where we made a lot of monsters faster than the player.

315
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And that wasn't negatively perceived at the time.

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It just made the monsters feel better that we had there.

317
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So, like, you absolutely can have monsters faster than the player.

318
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And I do think it's important to have those kinds of situations.

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Like, it just shouldn't be that it's...

320
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Like, it's just that, like, you need to make sure you're getting the balance right.

321
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I think that it's, like, a running theme with PeeWee 2 in general is that the target to hit is smaller.

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Like, because if we want the combat to be more engaging,

323
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
then that means there's a smaller target that, like...

324
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Like, it puts more pressure on the balance to be right.

325
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And so I think that's the main issue that we're running into is just that, like...

326
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Like, it's okay if, like, if everything...

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If...

328
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If...

329
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Okay, so this is sort of a larger topic, right?

330
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But effectively, it's like...

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
In PeeWee 1, there are so many tools that the knowledge ceiling is absolutely astronomical.

332
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And so you have a situation where a good player can completely dominate everything to, like, the absolute nth degree, right?

333
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Now, what that means is that you've got a scenario where...

334
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The game seems like an impenetrable mountain to a new player.

335
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Because, like, if you don't know what you're doing, the game is just, like, impossible to understand.

336
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And it's like, there's all these tools that you can use to improve yourself.

337
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But the existence of everything like that and, like, having such a huge skill ceiling means that you can just trivialize the game right at the start.

338
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And so, like, what that means...

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What that also means, though, is that, like, if we get balance numbers wrong...

340
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Like, if a monster has, like, double life by accident in PeeWee 1, it, like, doesn't even really matter.

341
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Whereas if a monster has double life in PeeWee 2, it matters a lot.

342
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And so what I'm saying is that the threshold for what is right is, like, way tighter in PeeWee 2.

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And so that means it will just take longer to balance and get it all correct.

344
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But it really is the case, I think, that it's getting all those numbers right that kind of makes it, like, that will make the combat ultimately fun at the end of the day.

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And, like, if we're doing our job correctly, then we'll still have this situation where a good player feels like they dominate and a bad player feels like they have a good time.

346
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But we won't have a situation where, if you're a good player, the combat is so trivialized that you literally never have a moment where you're in any danger or have any kind of, like, level of, like, sort of interest going on.

347
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And I think that's the worry that we have when we're looking at things is, like, if we get to the point where, like, a good player never has to face a single challenge ever, then I don't think that that's going to be a game that will ultimately be fun in the long term.

348
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And so that's kind of, like, that is, to me, the reason, like, what I fear happening if we just, like, say, okay, we're just going to, like, lower everything and make it easy.

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And that, once again, that isn't to say that we shouldn't necessarily, like, maybe Monster Life does have to come down.

350
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Like, if we're in the wrong band, we just need to lower it and that's fine.

351
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Like, we will get to the point where that is fun.

352
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But we'll do that by making, while still making sure that we have a good experience for, you know, like, ideally for everyone, right?

353
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Like, it should be the case that it is balanceable to that way.

354
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's just a lot harder in PoE2 context.

355
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well, I think a large portion want, like, bosses to be what is the challenging content, whereas right now it's almost the reverse, where there's so many clips of, like, people, like, dodge rolling away from, like, packs, right?

356
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And they're getting chased down, maybe not having a counterplay.

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And they're like, oh, my God, I'm, like, I'm just being chased down.

358
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So, and also I sort of disagree on the Act 1 changes in PoE1 not being negatively received.

359
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I do remember there was quite a lot of people that really didn't like that because of what you mentioned with, like, the faster monsters is generally a bad thing.

360
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So, I definitely do disagree with that.

361
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Just because I like to have things to actually go and start to address.

362
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Like, can I get a gauge on what you think is, like, where in the game it starts to become a problem?

363
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Or do you think it's, like, just straight out of the gate?

364
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Straight out of the gate.

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Like, even the second zone, like, the first zone might be okay, but the second zone with the wolves, it's, like, pretty, like, instant, where I don't feel like I'm getting that, like, ARPG play style.

366
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But won't we be hurting more players than we're helping with that?

367
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
By making monsters slower?

368
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Like, won't that immediately make it?

369
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah.

370
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Won't we that immediately mean that, like, a ton of players who actually enjoy the game because the combat is engaging immediately, like, what, doesn't it kill the game for them?

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Like, what I'm saying is, like, it's easy to say, like, oh, you make the game easier and everyone's happy, but it isn't the case.

372
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Like, a lot of people prefer the game to, like, actually have some challenge in it.

373
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Like, for example, right?

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Okay, so here's the thing, right?

375
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So, every night I go home and I play, and I, like, do test runs of everything, right?

376
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And it's, like, if we made it so that there wasn't any challenge for me in Act 1, I wouldn't play the game anymore.

377
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And that isn't helping anyone, right?

378
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Like, I need to keep playing the game every night to actually enjoy myself.

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's, like, if I'm not enjoying myself, then it's, like, how can I even develop the game correctly?

380
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So, on some level, it's, like, it has to be fun for me.

381
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And I know that if you, like, if you get to the point of having, like, everything just be trivial, it's, like, well, okay, like, why am I even playing this anymore?

382
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So, there has to be, like, there has to be some level of challenge.

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Now, there's just a lot.

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
There's a, I just think, again, thinking more on this specific, there's a big spectrum here.

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Like, for example, I know I have seen the feedback of Act 1 minus Canopy and Mana.

386
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Feel generally good on the pacing, the speed of monsters.

387
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You feel like you can almost do no-hit runs, is, like, kind of what people have said.

388
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And then you get to Act 2, and it's not too bad at the very start, and then you get to the, like, Helani gates, and it's like, okay, now everything's gone off the reservation.

389
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The Faradon have a problem.

390
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And then you get, and so, I've seen a decent spectrum like that, and I 100% want to fix that.

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Like, so, that's why I was asking you, for example, because I, there's just a lot of people on the different spectrums here that want different things, and so I'm trying to understand what, you know, how much we would need to change things for the discussion with you as opposed to with other players.

392
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Right.

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So, that's all I was asking there.

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Because I do intend on slowing down those extreme zones, and I think there are, like, 10 of them.

395
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Mm-hmm.

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And I think that is at least something hopefully a lot of viewers are going to be happy to hear, which is, like, okay, cool.

397
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
They are going to address those.

398
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So, the Dreadnought.

399
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Right.

400
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Utzal.

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You've got Canopy.

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We're going to start.

403
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Those are the most egregious I'm listing.

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm not saying those are the only problematic ones.

405
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

406
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And then you've got areas like Titan Valley, which is just, like, riddled with annoying monsters that are just, like, out of control.

407
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And you've got heaps of this.

408
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We start there, and we keep working backwards until we catch as much as we can.

409
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And it's going to be a lot of different changes.

410
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So, one could be, okay, like, why is it that there are six different varieties of which all are just, as you've, you know, heard people mentioning.

411
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I think I saw something that you had to think, which is they're playing POE 1, I think.

412
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah.

413
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Which I thought was a funny comparison.

414
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah.

415
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Which I'm like, okay, fair enough.

416
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
They need to, not every monster needs to slow down.

417
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But, like, for example, some of them can be fast.

418
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And maybe the answer is, okay, they should be weaker.

419
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So, sure, they engage you, but they die quick.

420
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Or maybe the answer is, like, there's too many of them.

421
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And then in a lot of the cases, it's going to be, like, okay, here's six different types of packs.

422
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Well, six of them are fast.

423
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Well, that's a problem.

424
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Five is a fast.

425
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That's a problem.

426
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Four are fast.

427
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's a problem.

428
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Three are fast.

429
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's probably still a problem.

430
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But two are fast.

431
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's probably more acceptable.

432
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So, you get two really slow, maybe two fast, two kind of in the middle.

433
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And you get some big slow monsters, some small monsters.

434
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And that distribution isn't quite right in a lot of zones.

435
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And so, this is why, again, why I asked.

436
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Because I would say some zones have a nice, here are the slow monsters and here are the fast monsters.

437
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And it's kind of cool.

438
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You get this, like, up and down pacing.

439
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And it can feel kind of fun where sometimes you're on edge and sometimes you're just obliterating things.

440
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And then you get the ones where you're like, holy, I've just been three zones in a row

441
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
where I'm just on edge, getting swarmed, like, absolutely.

442
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And that creates this extreme negative feeling of, like, I can't do the things that my skills want me to do.

443
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And that is bad.

444
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I definitely want to fix that.

445
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And I want to fix that imminently.

446
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Like, I'm going to immediately get on to doing that.

447
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So, there is a huge range of spectrum of players that want different things here.

448
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And I want to at least address that thing because I know that's just bad.

449
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Like, I think that's bad for everyone.

450
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't think that's bad for some people.

451
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think that's bad for, oh, I mean, everyone.

452
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's for a huge majority.

453
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So, we can start there for sure.

454
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But to be clear, though, like, we still do need to have some monsters that are faster than the player.

455
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It can't be that none are.

456
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And, like, things like the wolves in the second area, like, if we didn't have that,

457
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
then I think that you wouldn't even, like, once again, you wouldn't get the feeling of, like,

458
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
you would immediately out of the gate have the game as just trivial.

459
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And, like, I think that that really would hurt the game a lot.

460
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Like, I think that that would be a big problem.

461
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So, it's really just a question of, like, if there are parts that are frustrating, we'll address them.

462
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But, like, it isn't the case that just everything needs to be slower.

463
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It really, really would hurt.

464
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So, I think that...

465
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
There's another thing you...

466
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I was just going to say, I think there's almost, like, two different player bases where there are a lot of people that just want to blast and maybe have challenging bosses.

467
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And then there are people that want, like, the entire gameplay, every second to second moment to be, like, very engaging.

468
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So, it's...

469
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't know that I agree with that either because I don't think it's so binary, as you say.

470
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Like, there is a middle ground that will work.

471
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Like, I'm almost certain that there is.

472
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And the way that you get there is by just looking at the individual cases and just fixing every one of them until, like, the rough edges are all sord off, you know, sanded off.

473
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And then, you know, and then it kind of works.

474
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And, like, you'll get to a point where, like, you just don't get frustrating experiences anymore because we've managed to sort of fix all of those cases.

475
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And that point won't be in a situation where just everything is slow.

476
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Like, we really will still have a level of engagement there.

477
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I guess the problem with everything being so fast and part of why I pointed out, like, everything almost is because it's such a heavy focus on combo gameplay right now.

478
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But it feels like the speed of the monsters are heavily incentivizing, like, one button builds.

479
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Like, as soon as I could, I was like, the less I can do, the better everything will feel just because I don't have time to set up combos.

480
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
We're getting completely overwhelmed.

481
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That's why I pointed out everything is a bit of an issue.

482
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Well, it isn't necessarily the case that you have to use a combo on every monster.

483
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Like, if you've got stuff that's fast, you don't use combos on that because it's disrupting you.

484
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But then also, it is also important that monsters do disrupt your combos because otherwise your gameplay just degenerates into doing, like, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

485
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Like, the monsters have to be able â€“ like, there has to be situations where your plans are disrupted in order to, like, have a situation where you can respond to things.

486
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Like, you actually get some counterplay on stuff like that.

487
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And so the monster designs have to reflect that on some level.

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But, like, it's always an amount, right?

489
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Like, there's an amount of that you need.

490
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And there's probably too much of that going on.

491
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But you still need an amount of that or, you know, it just becomes all flat.

492
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Like, we've â€“ I mean, we've been talking about, like â€“ look, the last few days we've been talking about some, like, pretty extreme considerations and things.

493
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And, like, you know, talking about â€“ the monster life is the main thing, which you could argue is player damage, right?

494
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Obviously â€“

495
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, monster life is the easiest way.

496
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
If everything is too weak, then monster life is the way to solve it.

497
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, yeah.

498
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
If there's a few outliers of builds that find the tricks to do good, then, yes.

499
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It is â€“ bring all players up or bring all monsters down.

500
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
They're the same thing.

501
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And, like, we have been talking about a lot of this and, like, actually going, like, what are we â€“ what would we be willing to do here?

502
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
How would we be willing to change it?

503
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What are we willing to test?

504
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
What are we willing to try?

505
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And, like, there's heaps of things on the cards here.

506
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Like, kind of honestly, everything's kind of been on the cards as long as we don't feel, like, at the end of the day that we've taken the teeth out of the game in terms of difficulty.

507
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Like, that is what's important to us is making the game still have a feeling of heart being difficult.

508
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And I would say out more than just bosses.

509
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Like, it shouldn't just be that the bosses are the only thing that's difficult.

510
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Sure.

511
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And we certainly don't want it to devolve into what I would argue is, you know â€“ I know this is, like, way further away.

512
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But, like, you know, again, we're talking about changing â€“ it could be changing anything here.

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And the one thing I also worry about is getting to the thing where â€“ I would argue a lot of the difficulty in P.O.E. 1 outside of a lot of the boss fights is just, like, you occasionally just instantaneously die to something.

514
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And you're like, I don't even know what I died to.

515
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And a lot of that is where you get, like â€“ it isn't necessarily from monsters being too hard.

516
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And it is often from just, like, spam and too much stuff going on combined with, like, daemons and volatiles and all of that.

517
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So making sure we avoid that as well.

518
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But it does mean the sense that then you kind of get that, like, okay, you have to have it be that you're engaging with the monsters for it to be difficult.

519
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Which kind of means monsters do need to actually pose a threat, and you need to be able to see what they're doing and react to what they're doing.

520
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Now, I wouldn't say that's universally perfect, but that's an argument for, like, you know, not wanting to get it to the point where it's too much of that just, like â€“ well, I guess that's an argument for de-swarming things, as you said.

521
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Which I agree with, by the way. It is, like, an important thing because it is kind of getting towards that, and that contributes towards where things are slow and stuff.

522
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But I wouldn't personally argue that every zone feels swarmy.

523
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I think there's a swarmy argument. I 100% want to focus on solving first.

524
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And then there's, like, a certain things are fast and certain things are slow, and maybe there's that.

525
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So, yeah, I'm not entirely sure where I was going with that, but I just want to â€“ I guess it's more just giving my sense of where I want to make sure we don't end up is in that place,

526
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
just to make sure, and we want to be real careful about not getting to that point.

527
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So, I would actually say we're probably a bit too far there in a lot of the areas, but I don't think it is a universal problem right now.

528
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I think also, especially â€“ even though Warrior is â€“ or Mace skills are particularly strong now due to being able to use a shield,

529
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
but it can feel very bad that, like, every damage node, like, has a downside, whereas it isn't really the case for the other builds,

530
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
where, like, with Maces, it's like, yeah, you get 40% increased damage, but 5% reduced attack speed.

531
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And reduced attack speed, especially with all these combos, can feel particularly bad compared to others.

532
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I would say, like, Maces are kind of good right now, but a lot of that is the shield.

533
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I actually do think there is a bit too much of the â€“ I actually like a little bit of, like, here may be a cluster or two having the kind of upside-downside,

534
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:33,000
but it's honestly something we've â€“ you know, obviously Keystones have upside-downside, but yes, it's true that probably there's kind of too many passives,

535
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
especially in the Warrior section, that are a little bit too giving downsides, where it was something, honestly, that's a bit experimental to Peewee too.

536
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Like, we didn't have that in Peewee 1, and we were like, let's give it a go, and maybe we went a little bit overboard with it in that part of the tree.

537
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But I don't hate it as a concept. I think it's just that it's a little bit too saturated there.

538
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I will agree with you there 100%.

539
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I would say, as people hopefully would know, we're going to iterate on that passive tree a million times, so it'll find its sweet spot for sure, and it's definitely not there yet.

540
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I do think it's important, though, that, like, Keystones can be felt, and so â€“

541
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Well, we're not talking Keystones.

542
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to say Keystones. I just said Notables can be felt.

543
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
And so part of the reason for the upside-downside thing is that, like, it lets you do a larger damage bonus because it's got the downside,

544
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and therefore you're going to really feel that damage bonus.

545
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
No, they are good. I think it's the frequency of them in that part of the tree.

546
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But I'm saying that you can find another way maybe to do that, but it's like â€“ I do think that, like, having that feeling of, like,

547
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I really felt that node is something that we â€“ like, that that is a thing that you do get, and that, you know â€“

548
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That is important in our passive tree philosophy, yes, is that you â€“ the before and after of taking a notable,

549
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
especially the first â€“ obviously, nodes become less valuable as you get higher level because they're just saturating into a bunch of diminishing returns â€“

550
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
well, not diminishing returns, but more like, you know, the 500% to 520% increase is going to matter less than the 0% to 20% and whatnot.

551
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But especially for the first chunk of the game, we want it to be that every notable is felt.

552
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Like, you're like, I definitely now can feel the difference.

553
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And I would say, yeah, a lot don't hit that mark.

554
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Some do, some don't.

555
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But, yeah, we've been trying new things there, so.

556
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yep.

557
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Bit of a pivot.

558
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Bit of a pivot.

559
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah.

560
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So, the next question, I want to talk a little bit about the fact that you have only done, like, the crazy large changes between seasons,

561
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and you talked a little bit about that you felt forced to treat the game like it was released.

562
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Are you still happy with doing only large balance changes between patches,

563
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
or is that something you would maybe revisit with something like every two weeks,

564
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
especially with, like, a warning period, like, changes are coming in four days?

565
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's hard.

566
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I don't think that you can just nerf people in the middle of a league no matter what.

567
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Like, we get highly punished for that.

568
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And, look, I mean, people are going to be unhappy about nerfs whenever we do them, as, you know, like, as we can see.

569
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But, like, it is actually strictly worse if you get nerfed while you're playing the game.

570
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Now, we're in a position now where, because things, like, are probably possibly under-tuned,

571
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
that we can just do mid-league buffs.

572
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And so that means you'll see way more patch changes happening now,

573
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
because, like, it's okay to do major buffs during the middle of a league.

574
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Which we're doing.

575
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah, which we're doing now.

576
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I generated a relatively large list yesterday.

577
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Which, I know we have that whole, you know, philosophical discussion earlier about player power.

578
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Well, like, there are many builds, many skills that are underneath,

579
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
because obviously otherwise I wouldn't be, yesterday, have spent a good chunk of the day going through

580
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and assessing what needs to be increased, right?

581
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So, like, I don't want it to take as, like, a...

582
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't want people to take away from that as being, like, a no, we're happy with the current balance.

583
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Like, obviously not.

584
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We're still going to make changes.

585
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We're still going through everything.

586
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And we'll get to that sweet spot for sure.

587
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But, like...

588
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I mean, it's going to end up feeling like a season of buffs this time.

589
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And the reason why it'll feel that way is because, like, the medicine has gone down now.

590
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Now we can start on all of the actual, like, you know, like, all of the positive buff parts.

591
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And so it's like the...

592
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Like, last season we just weren't even in a, like, in a situation where we could even do that, right?

593
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Because it's like you already had...

594
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
We genuinely tried to.

595
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We genuinely tried to.

596
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We had this plan of, like, bring all the top-end outliers down and then make sure everything is feeling good in the middle.

597
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And we started with the bringing outliers down.

598
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And then all of a sudden, and this is why the patch notes were so late, we were like, oh, no.

599
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Like, we're, like, running out of time here.

600
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Like, we thought we could get through more of the balance and start bringing more things up.

601
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We didn't get to do all that we had hoped to do.

602
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But, like, by that point, it's kind of too late.

603
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And so, like, we're going in and then now our idea here is, like, we thought we were.

604
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Like, literally up until the last minute, we were like, okay, we're going to keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.

605
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Right, let's start buffing.

606
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Let's look at weak things.

607
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And, like, it just ended up being too time-consuming.

608
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And so the answer here is now, though, it's like, well, let's just keep going.

609
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And so obviously the first few days is really, like, looking at all the player feedback and going, what are the biggest problems, right?

610
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And this is where you get the Act 3 changes.

611
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You get the minion builds.

612
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You get the big things.

613
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And we are trying to address all of that.

614
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And I understand just game-wide balance is a big thing.

615
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But now it's just going to be like, all right, this skill, this skill, this skill, this skill, this skill, this skill.

616
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Like, let's go.

617
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
What are we changing?

618
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,000
What are we changing?

619
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
What are we changing?

620
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Going through literally every single one on every single skill tree and every single reservation.

621
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And then we're going to go, okay, well, you've still got Blood Mage and Acolyder Chiola sitting there at 0%, 0.1% played.

622
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Okay, well, clearly not doing well enough.

623
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Let's target that and just go on and just keep iterating through until we can get as far as we can.

624
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And maybe we catch everything.

625
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Maybe we don't.

626
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But, like, the intention is to not stop just because the release day happened.

627
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Like, we had a goal.

628
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
We didn't achieve that goal.

629
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And so we just need to keep going.

630
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And do you have, like, a rough idea?

631
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Like, you were saying you were working on a lot of things to be buffed.

632
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Do you have a rough idea on how early we could be seeing those already?

633
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Well, we'll be seeing them continuously.

634
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Like, okay, so this was a...

635
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Two days?

636
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

637
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Okay, perfect.

638
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
This was a funny thing.

639
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's what I wanted to do.

640
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Okay, so, like, one of the things I think that was majorly misinterpreted, that things we're working on post, was, like, this was the things we were working on that day.

641
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Like, literally, that was that day's worth of work that we were talking about.

642
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And then the next day, it's like, well, now we're doing this Act 3 stuff.

643
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And, like, today we'll be doing a bunch of other stuff.

644
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And, like, you know what I'm saying?

645
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It's like every day we're going to be, like, continuing to iterate and do stuff.

646
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's like, so the idea that someone's like, oh, they're not even acknowledging this thing.

647
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's like, well, come on.

648
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
We've literally had, like, that was one work day.

649
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You know, like, we've got, there's more stuff coming, right?

650
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Which we need to be more clear about.

651
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Sure, sure.

652
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
We'll try to be more specific about that, but yes.

653
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I mean, the one that I found the most funny with that is it's like, I'm like, okay, we're

654
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
going to look into all this Act 3 stuff, but in the meantime, we'll just add some checkpoints.

655
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And it's like, the reason I put that in there is because, like, that's literally a thing

656
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
we already noticed was bad.

657
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And it's like, it's not like hurting anyone to add some more.

658
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So it's like the idea that we're like, oh, we're just going to solve the whole thing

659
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
by adding checkpoints was, like, ridiculous.

660
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Like, obviously that wasn't the case.

661
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It was just like, here's just the thing that I can just tell someone, hey, go do this while

662
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm looking at this.

663
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
You know, and like, and so they did that.

664
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And so then that'll go in the next version.

665
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But, you know, like, it's like, then it's like the next, like, four hours after that,

666
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm like sitting there going through areas and trying to work out what's, you know, like

667
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
what needs to improve about them.

668
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah.

669
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So checkpoints is kind of something I want to talk about with the large zones and stuff.

670
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
And you posted, you made a post yesterday talking about that several Act 3 zones would

671
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
be reduced in size.

672
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But as a core idea, is Path of Exile 2 being aimed more at, like, doing one long playthrough

673
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and finishing up one character rather than do, like, five to ten characters and the people

674
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
that are playing thousands of hours per year?

675
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I mean, I don't, that's, once again, it's not like I'm not targeting one or the other.

676
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Like, the, your second, I mean, like, if you're doing multiple playthroughs, the game is a lot

677
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
faster just due to the, like, items and stuff that you have.

678
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Like, that is definitely the case.

679
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You know, like.

680
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Well, a big thing that's missing.

681
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Making multiple characters in a league is certainly something that I expect and want you to be able

682
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,000
to do.

683
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Well, a big thing that's missing comparatively to POE 1 is our, our ability to speed ourselves

684
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
up, right, on our second characters.

685
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
In POE 1, you have things like 7 League Step and stuff like that.

686
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And at least so far, we don't have that many alternatives for that.

687
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And our movement abilities are completely different.

688
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
No Quicksilver.

689
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So even though, like, we can, we can kill the bosses faster, but since the zones are so large,

690
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
we can't get, like, the same amount of speed on our second and third character onwards

691
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
that we would be expecting POE 1.

692
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Well, is the zone largeness issue, like, like, I mean, Act 3 was the one I would say that

693
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
was, like, pretty obvious as far as, like, things like that go.

694
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But if it comes to other zones, it's just a question of what are those zones and which

695
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000
are the issues.

696
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And, like, also the other thing is, is that, like, generally speaking, like, once you know

697
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:16,000
how the zone works, there are ways then to, like, to, to, to, to, to know what you're

698
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
looking for and sort of how to go places and what to do.

699
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So to the extent that that isn't the case, that's why, like, when we're looking at, like,

700
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
that's why when we're looking at Act 3, it's not just make this zone smaller.

701
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's like, what's actually the reason why a player who is experienced is not able to

702
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
find the thing that they're looking for, right?

703
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And that's where we come to, like, oh, there's this whole area over here that you could just

704
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
walk down and you have no idea whether or not that's important or not.

705
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And so then you end up doing that and it just wastes a bunch of your time.

706
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
But, like, the intention is to make it so that, like, if you know what you're doing, then you

707
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
know where to go and, like, you don't have a problem with that.

708
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So, like, that's, that, that's why a lot of the changes in Act 3 are just like, okay,

709
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
yeah, like, you get this, you randomly get bad luck and then the Chimera Wetland has the

710
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
stupid Y fork thing in it and, like, takes ages to go one way or the other.

711
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's like, you get rid of all of that stuff and then the zones won't feel so large because,

712
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
like, you'll know where you're going and you'll know how to get, you know, it kind of

713
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,000
works out that way.

714
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But I do know the layouts, though, and they are very large even with knowing the layouts,

715
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
just because our movement speed is, like, relatively slow.

716
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Like, even, like, Matlin Waterways, before they're getting reworked, hopefully the rework

717
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
makes them a lot slower.

718
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But I know exactly where I'm going.

719
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm not, like, backtracking into the wrong area making it longer.

720
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It is just a lot of these zones are very long.

721
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That area in particular, like, I understand that area is a challenging one and it's hard

722
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
for us to actually fix, like, trivially because just the way that the level generation works

723
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
there, there's not an easy, like, it's not, like, okay, like, we, other areas we can

724
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
change the layouts very easily because, like, of the way that our generation works.

725
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
But that area has a very fixed type of layout.

726
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And so it's going to take more effort, which is why it was on the list, because I didn't

727
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
have an immediate, like, thing I could do that day to sort that one out.

728
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But, like, I understand that that's an area of concern for people.

729
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
But, like, once again, it's like, that's a specific area and I wouldn't say that, like,

730
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
that the issues that that area has would apply to the whole game.

731
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You know, like, that's just an area, a specific problem for that particular area.

732
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So is speeding the player up an option?

733
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Like, is that something you'd be willing to consider?

734
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Well, it sort of depends on how it was done.

735
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Like, we've discussed some things in that area, like, before.

736
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm not necessarily against that, but it would have to be done in a way that didn't compromise

737
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:29,000
the combat and compromise, like, the, the, the, um, like, it shouldn't be the case that

738
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
you'd, I mean, because, okay, because, because this is the issue with this, right, is that

739
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
speeding up the player is, um, if you speed up the player to the point where they're once

740
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
again faster, then always faster than the monsters, then you get back to the, like, combat

741
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
doesn't work anymore, like, you'd combat an optional kind of, like, situation again.

742
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Um, so, like, we have to, we would have to find a way to do that that wasn't going to,

743
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
like, break that as well.

744
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So there might be something we can do there, and we've kind of been discussing that.

745
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Um, because I'm not, like, I'm not exactly wanting to subject people to, like, you know,

746
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
running when they're not doing anything, right?

747
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But, um, the, the, it's the, it's just a question of finding a way to do that that's

748
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
not going to.

749
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's hard to say anything specific because, like, there's a little bit of, like, the moment

750
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
we say a specific solution.

751
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yeah.

752
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
People might hold us accountable to that in a degree.

753
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And, like, we haven't tried it yet, so we can't, like, have been talking about it.

754
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We do have some options we want to try.

755
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I, we just don't want to talk about them before we try them.

756
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Right.

757
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Um, but, like, yes, I agree.

758
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Now, you mentioned one other thing there, just because I don't want to gloss over things

759
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
too much, which is, you mentioned the Twink unique problem.

760
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah.

761
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Uh, which is seven league steps.

762
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
There are many, many, many, many, many more items in POE1 that you can use to streamline

763
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the efficiency on re-roll.

764
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That is still very deficient, yes.

765
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It will come in time, I assure you.

766
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's just a matter of, we did higher level uniques this time.

767
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Obviously, they're not going to have low level item requirements.

768
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Um, maybe next time there's a more even split.

769
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't know.

770
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
We just need to keep going with the uniques and we'll eventually get there.

771
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
We do have some designs that, um, achieve specifically the low level high movement speed

772
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
boots.

773
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We do have that as a thing that I, I definitely already have designed to just, I think it's

774
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
just waiting on the art and then it's going to go in.

775
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Um, but yeah, we just, there's going to be a lot more of those coming over time as well.

776
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Like that will solve itself in due time for sure.

777
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And is that like the question I was, okay, so is for damage, the twinking situation is

778
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
not bad right now, right?

779
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It's not as bad.

780
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It's not as bad.

781
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Again, you can kill stuff fast.

782
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's the movement speed specifically that we're talking about.

783
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And the fact that we don't have movement abilities, like in the same way, like there's only so

784
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
much speed you get with shield charge.

785
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Like if I'm doing like a third or fourth character, I can definitely get enough damage, right?

786
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's rough on my first character.

787
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But you don't have to use movement abilities as the solution to this.

788
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And I would prefer that that wasn't the solution because, um, then you end up with a kind

789
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
of like pretty lame sort of gameplay thing going on there.

790
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Like there's going to be a better way to improve that without using, having a movement

791
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
build, build, build a solution.

792
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We have some things on the cards.

793
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
We just need to test them out and try them and be able to actually have a good argument

794
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
as to why they work, why they are good.

795
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And we convince ourselves, damn, we should have done this before or they're bad.

796
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And we're like, here's why they're bad.

797
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And we can explain what we tried and why it's bad.

798
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But yeah, again, it's, it's, we're always a bit on, uh, discussing our, what those will

799
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
be because, uh, yes, again, they're being held accountable.

800
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
People get their hopes up for it and then we have to say it doesn't work.

801
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So like, it's a little bit of like, let us just try these things and then we'll see

802
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
what we come up with and we will, we'll tell people the moment that we have it.

803
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But again, it's not a piece of, um, it certainly is something that's come up and it will come

804
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
up every single repeat of the league.

805
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And so it's not like off our radar by any means.

806
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Okay.

807
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
That's good.

808
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Um, so obviously a bit of a different question, but, uh, on console debuffs have the option

809
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
to be at the bottom of the screen.

810
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Could that be a toggleable option for PC?

811
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Um, just, um, can be rough today.

812
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'll look into that.

813
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It wasn't, it wasn't on my radar.

814
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
We might be able to do something.

815
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
We have a, um, a full buff UI rework going on at some point soon.

816
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Um, it was planned for earlier where like, you know, so this can be part of the consideration,

817
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I guess.

818
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
But yeah, the, um, our UX guy's currently working on, has it on top five of his list kind

819
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
of thing of things that we're going to just do to improve the system.

820
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That wasn't to do with moving them, but we can add that to the list of things that we

821
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,000
might want to do.

822
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I mean, it's the hope they can go behind the boss's life bars and you know, all that problem.

823
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
And, um, hopefully if it's good enough as well, we can port that to Peewee 1 because

824
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
it's a more egregious problem there for sure.

825
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah.

826
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Um, the next question is about, uh, in Peewee 1, we have a lot of player agency over how

827
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
we solve early problems.

828
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Like the skill tree has a lot of temporary fixes, uh, for a build early on where if your

829
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
gear isn't up to scratch, you can get 30 to like strength decks int, you can get, uh,

830
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
leech, you can get resists, even like specific ones like fire, cold, lightning, et cetera.

831
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You can get very easy access to fixing mana and stuff like that.

832
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Um, and a lot of things that are like temporary fixes that you later on fix with gear.

833
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Um, and the crafting bench also helps a lot more with that in Peewee 1.

834
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And I know runes are meant to be the solution here.

835
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Um, but we don't really get enough sockets early on.

836
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We don't get enough gear early on.

837
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And we then don't have any way at all to really fix this.

838
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Um, so why, why, why is it that you're not getting enough sockets early on?

839
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Well, that they're just not dropping.

840
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Even if you're checking the vendor, like I'm checking the vendor every time I level up,

841
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm, uh, disenchanting everything.

842
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I still don't get enough because the game is very difficult right now.

843
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So you try to keep getting gear upgrades.

844
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
There is not enough loot.

845
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
There is a lot of people complaining about not enough drops.

846
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I don't get the, I don't get the same experience of not getting enough socket walls personally.

847
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Like I would say that probably 80% of the gear I'd be wearing pretty much through the whole campaign would have sockets like in there.

848
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Um, so like if that's the case, then like there must be something I'm not understanding about like why that people feeling that way.

849
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Cause that's just like a totally different experience than what I see.

850
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Um, when I'm playing myself.

851
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah.

852
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I mean, I would love the intention.

853
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Sorry.

854
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The intention is that you use socket like socketables to fix those problems.

855
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And that is fundamentally identical to the crafting bench as far as the resultant, um, like, like ability to fix issues on your character.

856
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Um, like there's nothing about the crafting bench that really changes anything that way other than it's being less intuitive to use for new players.

857
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Well, it is a lot stronger.

858
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Well, there's the power.

859
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeah, there is the power.

860
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Well, okay.

861
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So sure there's the power, but like, I mean, that's a different question again, right?

862
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Like if you're talking about fixing problems, um, then, um, that, that just comes down to the values on the mods.

863
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Um, and like what, what, what those should be, which aren't necessarily right.

864
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Right.

865
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But the thing is, is that it's, it's, it's supposed to be that you're getting enough sockets to be able to do that.

866
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And I mean, I don't even, I don't buy stuff from the vendors.

867
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It just, as a qualifying thing that I don't buy socketables from the vendors and do that thing.

868
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I know people do that.

869
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
That's not a thing that I'm doing.

870
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I mean, I might do it.

871
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Like if I've got like, not like a stack of nine shards and I'm like, okay, I want to socket right now.

872
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I might like do that.

873
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But, um, generally speaking, that's not what I'm doing.

874
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So like there's some clearly some disconnect here.

875
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Um, as far as like what the, um, the, the, the,

876
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
the amount of loot that you're getting versus what I'm seeing, I suppose.

877
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Um, so like, I guess I just need to understand why, um, like, why does it feel so different?

878
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It might be quite, it might have a relatively high swinginess or something that we need to find a way, like more adding more.

879
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Um, like I know something that was suggested was adding more artifices orbs, uh, to fixed quest rewards through the game to minimize the RNG outcome.

880
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Right.

881
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Cause we added those quite late.

882
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
We didn't end up putting them in any.

883
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So that's something that we could definitely do, which would mean you just get more of them during campaign.

884
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And I'd be totally open to that.

885
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Like that's totally reasonable.

886
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
A second thing I'd like to do soon is explore.

887
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I know.

888
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I mean, sort of unrelated, but, um, is that, well, casters don't have their weapon crafting bench.

889
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And we do need to, we do need to, we do need to fix.

890
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
We have to add sockets to caster weapons.

891
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That needs to come as well.

892
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Um, now there is one slight concern that I have seen echoed in a decent bit of feedback, which is that the runes are, um, which is mitigated with more artifices orbs for sure.

893
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But the runes are creating a bit of a sense of, um, making it like the P.

894
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
We, the thing that the P.

895
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
We one sockets created, which is like replacing items becoming slightly harder.

896
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Yep.

897
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Um, so there's a little bit of just making sure we're careful about that as well.

898
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Um, but being able to have more artifices orbs and thus socket more gear will mitigate that so that when you get your upgrade, you're able to add a socket to it.

899
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Um.

900
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:47,000
But I would say that it's definitely the hard coded drops that would be the thing that, because if it's, if it's not happening to everyone, then it is a thing that, yeah, that we're better off solving that way.

901
00:47:47,000 --> 00:48:03,000
But yeah, the caster, caster weapons, getting rune sockets and rune, obviously runes for them and, um, uh, adding more art of deterministic artifices orbs to the campaign is certainly two things on my immediate radar to help at least mitigate some of this.

902
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Um, I might do a quick review on the power pass of the runes as well.

903
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Um, I don't, I just don't want them to be too much about giving damage, but it might be a lot of the more utility and defensive ones are just on the weak side.

904
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And, um, those can certainly come up immediately.

905
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Um.

906
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Well, the problem that you have once again is that, like, so I sort of mentioned this earlier, but if the tools that you have are too powerful, then you, the people who know to use them are benefited to a larger degree compared to people who don't.

907
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And what you're doing there is, um, then you end up in a situation where content, um, will, you know, be like, it's just a new player goes into this and it's like, well, I didn't know about this.

908
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And then, like, you get screwed over.

909
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And so, like, things like, um, even, even nodes on the passive tree can be this way where it's like, okay, well, you had to know to pick this.

910
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And if you didn't know to do that, then you're screwed.

911
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Right.

912
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Like, that's the kind of thing that's like a bit of a problem.

913
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Um, and so the, the, the, that we, we just have to be really careful about that.

914
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And, like, that's actually one of the reasons, by the way, um, why lesser runes exist.

915
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Because if, in, before, if you knew to put, um, a lightning damage rune in your weapon, um, then you would just, like, completely, like, ridiculous compared to anyone, to compare to anyone who didn't know that.

916
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And so it's like, you've got, like, it shouldn't be that just a single, like, there's a tool like that, which you just, just, just with knowledge alone, it's like, you're completely, like, uh, you're, you're completely overpowered compared to other people.

917
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So you just have to be, like, we just have to be really careful with that stuff.

918
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Well, it's important.

919
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
It's just important to make sure that the solutions are ultra, very front facing.

920
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Because that passive tree stuff, uh, you know, in Peewee 1, sure, I agreed.

921
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And it's, it seems obvious to a bunch of people.

922
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But then also, there's two problems going on there in the Peewee 1, which is, A, it adds to a sense of complexity.

923
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Because it's like, here are the things you must know before you start playing to have a good time.

924
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And I know that's one small piece of that puzzle, or that problem.

925
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Um, and the second thing is, uh, looking at Peewee 1 from that crafting bench, is that the crafting bench is in your hideout and not in any town, which I agree is a downside.

926
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Ideally, it would be more in your face.

927
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Um, and so, like, a lot of people just forget to use it and forget that it exists.

928
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Um, and that is a thing where, like, again, if you know, you know, and you have a good time.

929
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And if you don't know, you don't know.

930
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And you, you, like, um, suffering.

931
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So whatever the solutions end up being, we definitely need to make sure are, like, very front facing in your face.

932
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And are, like, here's clearly the very intuitive way to solve these problems.

933
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Um, so that's just an important piece of, like, philosophy we need to make sure we maintain.

934
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
A lot of that can be sold by, through Quest, though, right?

935
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,000
You can have an NPC early giving one of those, like, runes and even telling you, like, hey, chuck this in your weapon for more damage if you're using a bow.

936
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Um.

937
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Well, how do, it would, I mean, surely, if the runes are there to solve problems, then ideally we're not telling you exactly which one to use, right?

938
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Because it should be dependent on what your problem is.

939
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Um, but we do need to make sure that people have got enough artifices or to make sure they can do that.

940
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Yeah.

941
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
That's the main thing that I would say.

942
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah.

943
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
But you were talking about the problem that you're rewarded for knowledge, which I don't think necessarily is a bad thing.

944
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I think that is a good thing.

945
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
No, no.

946
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
You 100% should be rewarded for knowledge.

947
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
The question is, what is the degree of the reward?

948
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Mm-hmm.

949
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
There's a fine line there, for sure.

950
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
But, um, yeah.

951
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
There's some improvements around here to be made, and there's some good takeaways from that anyway, right?

952
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Like, the determinism, for sure.

953
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And I think it's also a matter of, like, okay, I think there is a guaranteed rune from Ogham Village.

954
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Maybe that's too late.

955
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
We should be doing that, like, earlier or having more of them.

956
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You know, again, more of that deterministic outcomes.

957
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But also maybe knowing that you're going to get that in advance would be helpful.

958
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I don't think we quite have that displayed.

959
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So it's like you, you know, some of those, like, the world map icons where you go and get a specific reward aren't, it's not necessarily explaining to the user what they're going to get.

960
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And so they might just be like, ah, it's just another one of those.

961
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I don't need another tier 4 skill gem.

962
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But they don't, that's because maybe they think it's that.

963
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So, yeah.

964
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Bit of information improvements and a bit of just, like, some power adjustments, some more determinism.

965
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Especially with Artifice's orbs, I actually 100% agree with that.

966
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I think if we hadn't have added that system so late into the development, we would have actually put that more throughout 100% anyway.

967
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
So we should just do it now.

968
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But, yeah.

969
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Well, 100% some improvements there.

970
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Another thing I'm curious about then, I asked about the skill tree.

971
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Do you feel like the skill tree gives a good or does a good enough job of doing temporary solutions right now that you can later out gear?

972
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Or, like, is that something you'd be open to looking at?

973
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Well, our core philosophy there was that the gear should give you base stat and the tree should multiply them.

974
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Which makes the tree implicitly worse at then solving the problem.

975
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So the intention there is that, now, whether or not, I would say we haven't really re-discussed it since then.

976
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I still believe that's a great thing to have.

977
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
There aren't some...

978
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
The other thing, just as a side note, is that there aren't runes that give you attributes, right?

979
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Mm-hmm.

980
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Right.

981
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And so that means that you can't solve attribute requirements with runes.

982
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Which is something that I brought up a bit ago, but, like, we didn't have time to look at what the implications of that were.

983
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
My sole fear with that is that it means that it is even harder now to replace an item with another item.

984
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
That is the concern.

985
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Yeah, it is.

986
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
That's why, like, something like 30 dex, 30 strength, etc. was obviously very nice in Peewee 1.

987
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And it does feel a little bit like, oof, I wish I didn't have to take that.

988
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But that gives you, like, incentive to fix that through a gear later.

989
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And obviously, we have so much resist on the skill tree in Peewee 1, too.

990
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I remember, like, because the first time I played Peewee 2, we didn't know anything about the skill tree and stuff like that.

991
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And I remember thinking, I was in, like, Act 2 somewhere, and I hadn't pre-planned my day.

992
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I hadn't, like, looked at the data mines or anything like that.

993
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So I was like, okay, let's go look at the skill tree where, like, where the resists are.

994
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Because I'm, like, 10%, 15% on the different res.

995
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So I'll pick up 15 on the skill tree.

996
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And there was just, like, that one in, like, Warrior left start.

997
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And I was very surprised for that.

998
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So, like, what's the reason for not having that much resist on the tree?

999
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Because, once again, as Mark said, the tree is, the theory of it is that the tree enhances what your items are doing in order to make the items.

1000
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
But, I mean, look, there's something to think about again.

1001
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Like, there might be something to that that we should be reconsidering.

1002
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Yeah.

1003
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Like, we'll 100% go have a discussion about this afterwards, for sure.

1004
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I certainly have a whole bunch of thoughts on this real quick.

1005
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And I just, I definitely want to go over it and just re-evaluate this.

1006
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Because, like, we did make a lot of these philosophical decisions, right?

1007
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Where, like, tree should multiply, obviously, aside from attributes.

1008
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And gear should give the base.

1009
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,000
And, like, you know, because an alternate solution might just be that the resistances given by the runes are, like, way too low as well.

1010
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Right?

1011
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Like, that certainly...

1012
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Because if you look at, think of, like, the tree for one on, obviously, Peewee 1.

1013
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And you combine that with the crafting bench on Peewee 1.

1014
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Like, the amount of resistances you're getting there, even from the lowest tier crafts and the tree, is enough to certainly be able to solve any problem.

1015
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
So, there's a little bit of just, like, making sure we don't want to make it too trivial.

1016
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So...

1017
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Well, the other thing as well is that the monsters are balanced, assuming a different amount of resistance than they were in Peewee 1.

1018
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So, that, like, changes things a little bit as well.

1019
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You know, like, the expectation is not that you have, like, high resistances through the game necessarily.

1020
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Like, the expectation is that...

1021
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Okay, well, the expectation is that you should be able to get through...

1022
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
From merely overcoming the negative resistances you get from going through the acts.

1023
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Like, if you're at 0%, you should be...

1024
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Like, it should be...

1025
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
That should be enough.

1026
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And then any improvement you have over that is supposed to be just, like, something that's making your character better.

1027
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So, like...

1028
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
But if the monster life or monster damage is not calibrated correctly, then it won't feel that way to the player.

1029
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
But, like, that was kind of...

1030
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Like, balancing around 0% was, like, another idea that we had to try and make it so that you always knew the amount of resistances you were supposed to have.

1031
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Like, being that, like, if the number is red, you need more.

1032
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And if the number is not red, then you have enough.

1033
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Like, that was kind of the theory in order to make it more obvious.

1034
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Like, to...

1035
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Like, what people are supposed to do there.

1036
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
The other thing about the tree that can be a bit tricky here is that when you have that problem...

1037
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Like, you probably have that problem immediately where you're like, oh, I'm dying to all this fire damage.

1038
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I don't...

1039
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
This boss, I don't have enough fire resistance.

1040
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
The answer can't be, like, okay, I need to look at my tree and get some fire resist.

1041
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Because that's too late, right?

1042
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Like, you need to solve this problem more immediately.

1043
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Exactly.

1044
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Right.

1045
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So having a more immediate solution is ideally what it would be.

1046
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So ideally there you'd be like, okay, I'm going to swap this item for this item and or maybe put this rune in.

1047
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And now I might have another go and have a good time.

1048
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Where if the answer is like, okay, there's resistance nodes over here.

1049
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I just need to get six more levels so I can get them to then go and fight the boss.

1050
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Like, I understand there's a level of, like, obviously they're good at forward-thinking problem-solving.

1051
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
But, like, when you're, like, in the moment and you're like, damn, I'm struggling right now.

1052
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
What am I going to do right now?

1053
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It needs to be a more immediate solution.

1054
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And that's why a rune can be better.

1055
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
The passive tree solves it in one regard but doesn't solve it in another regard.

1056
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And it's important that, yes, the runes are there to solve that problem and certain items are there.

1057
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And, sure, it's easy.

1058
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It is not necessarily incorrect to say that that hasn't...

1059
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Those tools aren't as readily available as they should be.

1060
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Yeah.

1061
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Yeah, I also think part of it is that we're definitely not dropping enough gear.

1062
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Like, the state of my gear, it's quite rough.

1063
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Like, a lot of the things I've found throughout the campaign ends up being one or two stat items.

1064
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
If that...

1065
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
But isn't that just...

1066
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,000
But, like, this is the thing I would say about that is, like, okay, when you're saying your gear isn't good enough, you're also just saying the monsters are too powerful.

1067
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Like, it can just be the monsters.

1068
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Like, I don't think that it needs...

1069
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Like...

1070
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,000
There's an element here of, like, you might just be conditioned to wearing rares in every slot all the time, which doesn't have to be the case.

1071
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Like, the gear power is entirely relative to monster power.

1072
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
So, if you're saying your gear isn't good enough, it doesn't have to be the gear needs to get better.

1073
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It can't just be that the monsters are too hard.

1074
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Sure.

1075
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
If you're talking about also, like, damage and, like I said, speed.

1076
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
But, okay, can you give me an idea then?

1077
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,000
That's important, though, because one of the things that PeeWee 2 has gotten us is that

1078
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
you're not just saturating on rares, like, halfway through Act 1 anymore.

1079
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Like, you actually do...

1080
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
And what that actually means is that you have situations where you change from a rare to a magic.

1081
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
In some cases, you're, like, changing around your gear through the campaign.

1082
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And it results in way more, like, gear upgrades as you go through the campaign.

1083
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Like, there's way more often because, you know, you'll downgrade to a blue, but then you'll find a...

1084
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
You know, but then you'll find a regal and you'll upgrade it and then you'll add some more mods and so on.

1085
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And, like, just the amount of gear changes that are happening through the campaign is very, very high.

1086
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And so if we just dropped more gear, then we would lose out on that.

1087
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And whereas if we lower monster power, then you're improving the...

1088
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Like, you don't need...

1089
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Like, you don't...

1090
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
We wouldn't need to do that.

1091
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Once again, that doesn't necessarily say that the gear isn't exactly the right place.

1092
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
But what I am saying is that, like, it isn't just buff items.

1093
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Like, it is a question of player power relative to monster power.

1094
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
But the thing is, like, we aren't switching up gear a lot, though.

1095
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I think a lot of us feel like we're, like, finally finding, let's say, like, a glove with 60 life and 15 fire us.

1096
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And then we end up keeping that all the way until maps because we aren't really finding anything else.

1097
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
We have very little currency to craft with and stuff.

1098
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And a lot of people also reported finding, like, a large chunk of the majority of their currency in Act 1.

1099
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Where maybe people find as much as, like, 3 to 10 exalts in Act 1.

1100
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And then find 0 in Act 2 and 3.

1101
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So it seems, like, very, very early heavy.

1102
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I can't really explain why that would happen.

1103
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Because, like, the way that loot drops doesn't change.

1104
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
The only thing that changes is the number of magic and rare monsters that exist.

1105
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And so over time, the amount of loot you get increases through the game just because the number of rare and magic monsters increases.

1106
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And due to the way the currency drops work in PoE 2, the more of those you get, the more rare currency you'll get.

1107
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Which means that, like, it just feels like you get more currency.

1108
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
So, like, that isn't a phenomenon that I understand for sure.

1109
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Like, you should be getting more currency as you go through the acts for sure.

1110
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Like, that is as far as I understand.

1111
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Several times I've been joking about making new characters to farm currency.

1112
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And a lot of people, like, said they agreed.

1113
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Thankfully.

1114
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
We can relatively easily, if we need to, pretty much after this, add some logging for that and go and see what's actually happening.

1115
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But that is unusual.

1116
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Like, I can't explain why that would be the case.

1117
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I concur.

1118
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
There is, there isn't, it shouldn't work that way.

1119
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
It shouldn't be that way.

1120
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So if that is the case, which isn't necessarily true, but it could be, we should never, we're never going to rule out any bug or unintended thing where we can get some logging for that relatively fast and just get the check, the data and actually see what's happening.

1121
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
But I also do want to understand why some people feel like they get a lot of currency and others don't.

1122
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Like, I don't, once again, I just don't understand what can be the responsible for that.

1123
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Um, because like, you know, it's like, um, I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that every time I want six mods, I can get them, but I would say that I'm using exalts, like all through the campaign.

1124
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I'm using regals all through the campaign.

1125
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm like rolling, like from, up from whites to rares, like pretty continuously as you're going through.

1126
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
So like there's something odd about that that I need to understand.

1127
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Yeah.

1128
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I mean, even like, I would say myself, I got very like few regals and stuff to use.

1129
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Like definitely was, uh, not on the rich end during the campaign.

1130
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Well, how many is a few?

1131
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Um, I'd say through the campaign, I dropped probably four regals.

1132
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Well, hang on, but we're not talking about dropping only.

1133
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
We're talking about disenchanting too, right?

1134
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So, um, because of crafting being so RNG, I will generally have opted in.

1135
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I've, I've tried both obviously, uh, between like disenchanting, but I find that I benefit more from gambling than from actually trying to crafting.

1136
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:53,000
My experience with crafting is picking up every blue, looking for one stat regaling, and then that missing and the item not being usable.

1137
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Um, so.

1138
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
If you're not disenchanting rares, then you certainly won't get a lot of regals.

1139
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Sure, but I've tried both.

1140
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Right.

1141
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Well, I can't say much as to that, but, um, like that is the reason you don't have regals if you're, if, if, if, if, if, you know, like that is where like the, the primary source of regals through the campaign would be disenchanting.

1142
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Um, like that isn't to say that gambling isn't better.

1143
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Maybe it is, but, um, you know, like that, that it does explain that particular, particular one currency item at least.

1144
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It's also quite a few alchemies and stuff as well.

1145
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Yeah.

1146
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Alchemies are kind of not really intended to be that common anymore because the intentioned way to go through to rare is more via, um, more via regaling.

1147
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Um, so like alchemies are like relative, like the, the alchemies are the kind of like, oh, awesome.

1148
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I got an alchemy.

1149
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,000
That's like a kind of, that's, that's the uncommon thing that you do occasionally, not the like kind of common work a day crafting that you're doing all the time.

1150
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Um, so like, yeah, there should be that the regals are the, the, the primary source of, of, of crafted rares.

1151
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Yeah.

1152
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And that would go.

1153
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Well, the good benefit here is we have so many players right now that we can just, uh, get some data and get some analytics very, very quickly about what this actually is.

1154
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah.

1155
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And you might find that it's, um, just very, uh, sensitive to, you know, there's always just going to be a portion of unlucky players and a portion of lucky players.

1156
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Like I definitely know that there's a, a lot of swinginess of course, and that can happen.

1157
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
And again, that it might just be that.

1158
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:35,000
And I know you've probably played more than most, so arguably you should have the, uh, you should have the least, the most amount of data from a purely anecdotal perspective.

1159
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:43,000
So, um, you know, you probably have the, uh, the best average going on, uh, the most accurate average, I should say.

1160
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
But that being said, like we have the capacity to look into this very quickly and we can do so probably even today and figure out.

1161
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
What's going on and whether or not it meets our expectations.

1162
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So, so, um, the next thing I want to ask you about is, uh, the ailment thresholds.

1163
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
You have like how easy it is for the player to be stunned, uh, player to be frozen and stuff.

1164
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Uh, and I'd say that feels a little bit overly punishing when we don't have as many solutions or tools, right?

1165
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Because we have one charm slot and it is quite difficult to get a second or third.

1166
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Um, and that's competing for freeze immune, stun immune, poison immune, ignite immune, and chaos immune.

1167
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Um, sorry, chaos resist, uh, and bleed.

1168
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Now I would say poison, ignite, and bleed from the monsters don't actually do that much right now.

1169
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,000
But if it did, like this would be a very, very heavily competed for, like singular solution to, uh, to doing anything with that.

1170
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Um, so, and as an addendum to the question, I wonder, would you consider letting belts get more implicit charm slots based on item level?

1171
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
So like maybe at like 50 plus they have two and at 81 they get three.

1172
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Um, it's, I mean, we probably will increase the number of charm slots.

1173
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Like that is something that we like kind of were intending to do and never got to yet.

1174
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Um, but I don't think that the ailment threshold was in the right place before.

1175
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Like the effectively ailments didn't exist before we changed that.

1176
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Um, so like we need, like we needed a, we needed something that was going to actually cause them to happen.

1177
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Like, you know, during the campaign before you got frozen like three times, the whole campaign, it kind of was a bit, it was a bit silly.

1178
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Do you know what we didn't actually universally double the stunning?

1179
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
This, I know you mentioned that just to clear that up.

1180
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It was only, it was ailments that were changed, not stunning.

1181
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
They stun you more as things get higher level.

1182
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
The expected amount of stun threshold you should have goes up.

1183
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Um, so it's not, but it's pretty minimal throughout the entire campaign.

1184
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:43,000
But what we also increased is the, um, uh, you, you gain a bunch of stun threshold when you get light stun.

1185
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
So you have way, way, way lower probability of getting stunned locked.

1186
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Um, but then I would also point out like some of those charms just suck because it doesn't even mitigate the stun that stunned you.

1187
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And that is just something that we were like, we initially did.

1188
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And then we're like, oh, we need to change this.

1189
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And then it just got lost in the weeds.

1190
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So like the other thing is changing those, um, and I know the resistance ones work this way as well.

1191
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Like those just need to also cancel out the thing that caused it, um, or mitigate the thing that caused it.

1192
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And those where some do and some don't.

1193
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So that needs to change a hundred percent.

1194
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
And then, yes, we need more slots.

1195
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I think we're actually going to support up to six slots.

1196
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
That isn't to say that everyone will trivially have six, but there is UI for it.

1197
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Six is only, six is a thing you might be able to do with uniques and stuff like that.

1198
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:35,000
It's not something that you get, um, but it was certainly our expectation or intention, I should say, uh, that we give out more slots so that people are running more.

1199
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Like one is not what you should be running.

1200
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Uh, like two, certainly at high end minimum and like probably three and like sometimes four wouldn't be unreasonable.

1201
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Okay.

1202
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But it's interesting that even the ailment threshold change we made has not really affected most of the ailments that you just said.

1203
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Like you just were saying that like, you know, that bleed poison and stuff were not really doing much yet.

1204
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And it's like, yeah, like that, that wasn't even like even halving that number.

1205
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It apparently wasn't enough to make those be a thing that you need to care about.

1206
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Like only frozen is the one that really kind of changed.

1207
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I think.

1208
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
And like, for the most part that you actually noticed the stun thing is separate.

1209
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It's not part of the ailment threshold.

1210
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Yeah.

1211
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I mean, but if they did do a lot of damage, that'd be very overwhelming right now.

1212
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And things we can deal with.

1213
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Well, but I mean, yeah, like it's not like we want it to be overwhelming.

1214
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
It's a bit of a different game.

1215
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Right.

1216
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Like when you get the mod and modifiers and map mods and everything involved.

1217
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Sure.

1218
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Sure.

1219
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Um, but you know, it needs to, it does need to happen sometimes in order to actually be something that's worth mitigating.

1220
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Um, so now we just need to look at the actual, yeah, the charm stuff as well.

1221
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yeah.

1222
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And, and do you think the implicit will be tied to item level at all?

1223
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
So it'll be something that you don't necessarily have to do a crazy investment or a path on the tree?

1224
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I don't know what the answer to that is.

1225
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I have to think about what, how we want to introduce that.

1226
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Um, like that is a one way.

1227
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I mean, there, but there might be other ways.

1228
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I just have to look at that.

1229
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
The other thing is like charm.

1230
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:08,000
There's a, there's a level of like reviewing charms in general is just how, you know, aside from how many you have and not just their implicit, like their, their base value.

1231
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,000
There's also just like, I'd say a lot of the modifiers on them are just absolutely like nonsense.

1232
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Like, oh, recover four mana when it procs.

1233
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
It's like, okay, thanks.

1234
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That's not a useful thing to happen.

1235
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
So there's, um, a bunch of ethics is there.

1236
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
We just need to make better as well.

1237
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,000
And we'll may as well probably do that at the same time, unless of course it makes it take longer in which, uh, we'd rather just get out the number of charms first.

1238
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So, yeah.

1239
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Yeah.

1240
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Um, in PeeWee 1, we have masteries.

1241
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I am a huge fan of those, especially for temporary solutions.

1242
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Um, is that something you're open to bringing back in PeeWee 2?

1243
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Yeah.

1244
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I'm not a huge fan of them because they ended up devaluing the notables a lot.

1245
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Like the notables became really bland, um, when masteries were introduced.

1246
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And it's like, and it also means that like the way you are on the tree didn't matter as much either.

1247
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Um, which like kind of wasn't amazing.

1248
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
So I think that we like prefer to have it be a situation where the notables are more interesting.

1249
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And I do think that in PeeWee 2, the notables are very interesting.

1250
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Like it's something that like, I think that is notably good.

1251
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Um, so more work to do there.

1252
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
But there is more work to do, but I just, I don't love the way that the masteries kind of, yeah.

1253
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Like bland defied the, the notables.

1254
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And so, yeah, I think we can, that's probably, I think I prefer it.

1255
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Um, just yeah.

1256
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Putting the power in the notables rather than the masteries.

1257
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
But I don't feel like they're directly competing at each other, right?

1258
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
You can still have like really interesting masteries and notables.

1259
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Like those notables can still be super interesting.

1260
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I mean, there's only so many stats that, that, that, that can exist.

1261
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:52,000
But, uh, like, um, I mean, look, fundamentally everything competes with every other thing

1262
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
because of the way that like, you know, due to mod dilution.

1263
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So like you have to, you know, you, you, you, you have to budget that in some level.

1264
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Um, otherwise you just get a situation where you've got so many effects on your character

1265
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
that like everything, like nothing, no one thing matters at all.

1266
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Um, so like that's, you know, just.

1267
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I'm a bit more torn about this one personally, because I do agree there are downsides, but

1268
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
on the other hand, it's the one that added it to Peewee 1.

1269
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
So like, I'm a little bit like.

1270
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Well, I don't think it was, I don't think it was obvious at the time.

1271
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Yeah.

1272
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
What, what downside that would have.

1273
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I mean, that was certainly not something that I would be against.

1274
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
There's also just like the passive tree is like overwhelmingly complicated to people.

1275
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Right.

1276
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And so having this extra layer on it was probably my biggest thing of like, oh no, we made the

1277
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
thing that scares people the most more scary.

1278
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Right.

1279
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Um, because there's this extra layer that they have to, an extra keyword they have to know

1280
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,000
about.

1281
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
And that was my main thing of like, maybe we should just simplify the thing that is like

1282
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
the scariest thing.

1283
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Um, like that was a big argument to me, which, but there are, you know, there's intermediary

1284
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
grounds there as well, but yeah, there's like downsides to it for sure.

1285
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Like I agree.

1286
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Um, there's also maybe a way to make them have work.

1287
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I don't know.

1288
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
But I mean, what's the goal of it, right?

1289
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Like if the goal is to give you temporary solutions, then, um, we don't necessarily have

1290
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:11,000
to solve it there.

1291
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
We could just solve it in a different place and then it wouldn't be necessarily something

1292
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
that's going to give you temporary solutions.

1293
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Like the, the downsides that we see that those ones having.

1294
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And it's also the same as a, as a player, it is just very fun.

1295
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Like I, I absolutely enjoy it.

1296
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And it definitely ain't telling you, it does not make me feel like notables are devalued.

1297
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I was the, yeah, even more exciting.

1298
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Cause you get it when you get the notable.

1299
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Well, it's hard to identify that in the, it's hard to identify that in the moment because

1300
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
like, you don't like, you don't notice the lack of something like, you don't notice

1301
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
the lack of something of what something could have been in the same way that you notice,

1302
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
you know, like the thing that's in front of you that you're enjoying.

1303
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,000
You know what I mean?

1304
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Like it's harder to appreciate the fact that the notables are less cool in POE one.

1305
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Sure.

1306
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Because you're not thinking about that.

1307
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
You're thinking, I want the, I want the, the, the, um, I mean, you can at least rest

1308
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
assure that we're going to think about why they were important and, uh, what we could

1309
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
do to solve them, whether it be that means or another, like, yeah.

1310
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
The good thing about these is all of the things you are, almost everything you bring

1311
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
up is going to result in some sort of multi-hour discussion between us over the next week.

1312
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
So, um, well, which is the huge benefit of these things for sure.

1313
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Yeah.

1314
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Yeah.

1315
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And again, thank you for doing it.

1316
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
But, um, the next one's something I care a lot about, especially as a hardcore player,

1317
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
um, defenses seem very undertuned compared to offense.

1318
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
And just like anecdotally, um, if the, if the two options, right, if we look at it in

1319
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,000
a bit of hyperbole where, um, I get to watch like tankiness be out of hand or offense be

1320
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,000
out of hand.

1321
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
So like literally somebody walking up to a boss and one-shotting it, uh, or looking at

1322
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
somebody standing there being mortal.

1323
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Right.

1324
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I always think like if one should be out of hand, it's more interesting when the defensive

1325
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
one is out of hand, you still get to see the boss abilities and stuff like that.

1326
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Um, it, it seems so much easier always.

1327
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
And I think most patches have been like this where it's always easier to scale offense rather

1328
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
than defense.

1329
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And I wonder a little bit how you feel about that.

1330
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Well, you're not wrong that often the best defense is stacking all of the damage.

1331
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Yeah.

1332
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Um, I mean, we've suffered from this for a long while.

1333
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Um, it is ultimately a consequence of just having the game be like, again, talking about

1334
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
the hip firing and things be a bit unregulated with respect to the levels of uniques and

1335
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
builds and stuff going everywhere and hard to think of it all.

1336
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:39,000
And like, but it is generally true that we have more offensive, I guess people find damage

1337
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
in general to be more fun as an investment avenue.

1338
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:48,000
That is the real thing is that most people would prefer to invest in offense generally.

1339
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Uh, I agree with that.

1340
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,000
That is mostly the case.

1341
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
But then shouldn't be, shouldn't defense be even more encouraged than for the people that

1342
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:56,000
want to?

1343
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Because even as a hardcore player, I almost feel like it's the opposite.

1344
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Like anecdotally, for example, um, for, for 0.1 and, and full disclosure, I have not been

1345
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
able to get to Arbiter yet, right?

1346
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
We're very early in the league.

1347
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
So I don't know if you made them do less damage.

1348
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Um, but in 0.1, uh, other people were doing some testing and I asked soft core players to

1349
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
try a little bit.

1350
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And there were people that were getting one shot by Arbiter moves with 15 K life.

1351
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Uh, some that are like kind of hard.

1352
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Um, so as a hardcore player, what I felt like then I was like, well, and since I can't really

1353
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
tank, like there are multiple moves here that I can't tank, not just like one big telegraph

1354
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
one shot, but there are multiple here that I can't tank.

1355
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
So what I did to over prepare instead was I went in with so much damage that I just one

1356
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,000
shot the boss.

1357
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Um, which, which is a little bit deflating for me.

1358
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I would say Arbiter was one of the least fun bosses, whereas I would way rather go in

1359
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
and be so tanky that I can make a few mistakes.

1360
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Um, and then end up leaving.

1361
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's quite hard to split the difference between being tanky and being immortal.

1362
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Like surprisingly hard to get that right.

1363
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And when I say that it's because, um, you can regenerate life very quickly.

1364
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:19,000
And so if you don't die, like, okay.

1365
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And, and the other thing as well is that possibilities that do those big hits take a long time.

1366
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Right.

1367
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And like the bosses often can't hit you again immediately afterwards.

1368
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
It's like, they'll do their big ability and it's not like it's going to just immediately

1369
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
follow up with something that's going to chip you down either.

1370
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:39,000
So like if you fail tank them, no, but what I'm getting towards is that if the, if, if,

1371
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
if you don't have.

1372
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Something that's going to do a lot of damage at the, um, for, for those big hits.

1373
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Um, like we just have to be very careful because like, if, if, if you, if, if, like,

1374
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
let's say that one of those big hits did only like, you know, a third of your life, you know,

1375
01:16:59,000 --> 01:16:59,000
something like that.

1376
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Um, I don't think that then the boss would ever be able to kill you ever because it would

1377
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
have to effectively be able to do three of those, like of those, of those things before

1378
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
you can regenerate them.

1379
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
So what you're really asking for, and this is something we discussed a lot in the past,

1380
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
by the way, what you're asking for is for a more attrition based gameplay style, like

1381
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
a more MMO style thing.

1382
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
So, yeah.

1383
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
What you're really saying then is, is that you want flasks to do way less regeneration

1384
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
and you want regeneration to be controlled way more in general and then have a more attrition

1385
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
based gameplay style.

1386
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And that kind of just isn't a POE way of doing things.

1387
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Now, like, I mean, that could be a thing we've, we could change to, like that would be an option

1388
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,000
that we would have, but it would be like, it would be a, the balance change of the universe

1389
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
to do something like that.

1390
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Like it would be a complete redesign of all the damage and like bosses and like the whole

1391
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:49,000
way everything works.

1392
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Like, like change, change a more attrition style would just be like a, you know, an apocalyptic

1393
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
level of balance change compared to what we have for sure.

1394
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I mean, I'm not a hundred percent sure I agree with that.

1395
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
And I was going to ask, do you think the goal of a difficult boss should be to kill the player

1396
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
or to deny the player the loot?

1397
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I don't understand what that means.

1398
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
So when you're leaning more towards attrition based gameplay, right?

1399
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
You're recognizing as a player that you've entered a fight that you're maybe not fully

1400
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
ready for.

1401
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
You're maybe getting the boss to 30%.

1402
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
You're not able to finish it.

1403
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
And you're like, I have to leave.

1404
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I have to leave this fight.

1405
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I'm not strong enough.

1406
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
As opposed to punching the player with death, you're already just taking away the loot anyway.

1407
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
There's not an XP loss anyway at the moment.

1408
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Um, I mean, that's, I guess we're not thinking in those terms at all.

1409
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Like we're just like, but, but okay, sure.

1410
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
You're talking.

1411
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Okay.

1412
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Like, so, okay.

1413
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
So, so that question I would say only makes sense in an attrition based gameplay context,

1414
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
which is not what we have.

1415
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:55,000
So like, it kind of means that like, that like the boss doing abilities to be able to

1416
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:01,000
like, to the boss trying to win is, or like, and trying to kill you versus denying you

1417
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
the loot isn't a different circumstance unless there, unless there's attrition, which we

1418
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,000
don't have.

1419
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:12,000
So like, you know, it's so, so, so, so what I'm saying is, so, so what, what are you not

1420
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
agreeing with then?

1421
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Well, well, I think, I think you do have attrition based combat on a lot of bosses, right?

1422
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Because there are many of the like campaign bosses that don't necessarily have one shots.

1423
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Um, but even just on like, as a Viper, as an example, right?

1424
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Um, I was having a like quite long fight because I wasn't particularly powerful at Viper.

1425
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So I think I had to reset seven times without it killing me.

1426
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Uh, but seven times before I was able to actually kill Viper on my build, because I was running

1427
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
out of flasks.

1428
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Uh, and I, you don't have a good way to read them during the fight.

1429
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
So I'm not, I'm not, when I'm talking about attrition gameplay, I'm not talking about

1430
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
that.

1431
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm talking about attrition in the sense that your life pool is.

1432
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Is something that goes down over long periods of time, rather than something that moves

1433
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,000
around.

1434
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Well, well, at the fact of the S through the flask, right?

1435
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Well, yes.

1436
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I was no longer able to recover.

1437
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
So yes, the, to the, to the extent that we have attrition based gameplay, the attrition

1438
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
is through the flask.

1439
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,000
You are correct.

1440
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Like attrition via flask is what we have.

1441
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Um, so, uh, what I'm, what I, what I am saying though there.

1442
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Yeah.

1443
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Well, okay, sure.

1444
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Fair enough.

1445
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Like, yeah, the, the flasks do give you the attrition.

1446
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And so therefore.

1447
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
The campaign is quite attritioned.

1448
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
In, in, in, in that, in, in that way.

1449
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,000
The, the, the, the kind of cap comes off, so to speak at the end game where like, it can

1450
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
be very, um, it's certainly the case with a concept like leech that the moment that a

1451
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
boss can't one shot you at all, which.

1452
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Well, okay.

1453
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Like if you removed all sources of flask charge gain out, like, uh, that you could do in a

1454
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:57,000
boss fight, then you could probably reduce the size of the, um, big monster hits.

1455
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Well, uh, just to check real quick as well, just cause specifically talking about Arbiter.

1456
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Um, there's kind of a few things going on.

1457
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Like it is the intention that the skills and what just happens in the game and PeeWee 1 as

1458
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
well, and like some people might argue it's some sort of bad design or not.

1459
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I kind of like it.

1460
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Um, there are other skills that are more like your, your personal agility or dexterity based

1461
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
and you have to avoid them.

1462
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And that's like, you know, stand in the elder donuts and the, you know, the dancers and the

1463
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
like move into the lanes and the, you know, bullet hells esque things where it's like, that's

1464
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
not really your character as much.

1465
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Like, are you thinking those are fine or whether or not they're exactly tuned in this context,

1466
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,000
like in terms of timing, but are you okay with the idea that those kill you and you don't

1467
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,000
get to make like whether or not they could be more lenient as a different question, but

1468
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
like, would you, are you okay with those killing you and kind of your defenses don't really

1469
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,000
matter?

1470
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Like, are those the problem is what I'm just trying to understand exactly what skills are

1471
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,000
a problem.

1472
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Yeah.

1473
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So for the arbiter, I feel like there are multiple, right?

1474
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
You have the, the corridor move.

1475
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Uh, that was pretty much always a one shot.

1476
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Right.

1477
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
And sometimes obviously like you were saying, that wasn't like the main topic, but they can

1478
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
spawn almost too far away.

1479
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I remember seeing a clip of like Quinn running slightly in the wrong direction.

1480
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And then he sees the corridors the other way.

1481
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And he's like, Oh, it's, it's over for me.

1482
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Um, you have the arbiter move where he does like the fake out meteor where he starts like

1483
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
firing the beam into it and stuff.

1484
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Um, I guess the way like as a player, I would want defense to be is the more I invest into

1485
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:38,000
defense, the, the larger my room for error should be, uh, which is where I'm feeling.

1486
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
There's a big disjoint now, right.

1487
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Where it just isn't.

1488
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And then I'm entirely incentivized to go full offense because I'm still having enough defense

1489
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
that those, like those mid range hits and small hits, there's still not one shotting me.

1490
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Um, so all I need to be able to do is tank them.

1491
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And then, yeah, I just don't have an option for a huge one shots at all.

1492
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Okay.

1493
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
So yeah, I understand the, the, the point from a point of view from that one.

1494
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Um, the main thing is just, we're going to have to be really careful with the balance

1495
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:16,000
to make sure that it isn't now just like, you know, 20% of investment of the way there.

1496
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Now you don't get one shot by them.

1497
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,000
So you just hold down, you know, whatever button on the boss or whatever.

1498
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And now you're leeching permanently and you're fine.

1499
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Um, that's the concern.

1500
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So like, if it is a like universal, okay.

1501
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Like for example, would it be okay that, I mean, look, the corridor, let's use that as

1502
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
the example.

1503
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,000
So the corridor obviously has some like, okay, it's too hard to get, we need to probably

1504
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
improve the, uh, the way the lane spawn such that you don't get into that situation where

1505
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
like, this is literally impossible for me to run there unless I have X or Y.

1506
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Um, there is the thing where like, okay, for example, if like life regen wasn't regulated,

1507
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
like, do you really think any player in the game, like this is fine, I'm not saying this

1508
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,000
is wrong or right, should just be able to AFK in that?

1509
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Um, I'm just curious.

1510
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yeah.

1511
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
So definitely.

1512
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I prefer that over watching people, one shot bosses a hundred percent with enough investment.

1513
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Well, no, I, we won't disagree, but just like, yeah.

1514
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Do I'm just curious.

1515
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Do we, do you actually think it should be okay or able to?

1516
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Um, yeah, I'm not entirely against something just being a straight up one shot, like failing

1517
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
the memory game, for example, in Pee Wee 1.

1518
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Like I'm not inherently against that.

1519
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Um, but I do think the, the current ones are a little bit like too fast to be those ones.

1520
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Yeah.

1521
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I, I, I, I agree.

1522
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I just think there's, there is two problems here, which I'm interested in.

1523
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:49,000
One is, uh, mechanics feeling fear, which there are things here that are unfair and that is

1524
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
bad and they need changing.

1525
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Um, and I will get that adjusted today and then, and I'll get that on live as soon as

1526
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I can, which might even also be today.

1527
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Um, the other thing would be that there are the, the bigger thing, which is that investing

1528
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,000
in defense is not allowing you to mitigate it.

1529
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's like, so it's a different from the corridor skill.

1530
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
There's just like whether or not investing in defense enough, it gives you enough defense

1531
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
against things in general, against the bosses, which maybe isn't the case.

1532
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
It might be that it might be that.

1533
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Yes.

1534
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You investing in defense needs to be more advantageous right now, for sure.

1535
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And like, don't get me wrong.

1536
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
There's nothing more.

1537
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
And I've spoken about this before in the past.

1538
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
There's nothing more demoralizing than putting, you know, hundreds of hours into a boss.

1539
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
And then it's just like, bro, deleted.

1540
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
And it's like, Oh, great.

1541
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,000
That was also demoralizing to just watch someone sit there and face tank it and just attack it

1542
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
with no, like having to, not even having to move.

1543
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Like that's also.

1544
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Especially without, especially without the gear.

1545
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Like it's kind of, it's, it's, it's almost a bit ridiculous to discuss like which, which

1546
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
of these two horrible outcomes is better.

1547
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Like, you know, like surely the actual answer is like neither of them should be happening.

1548
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
No, no.

1549
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I agree.

1550
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
It's just that it's pretty rare that we've seen defense be the really OP one.

1551
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
That's all right.

1552
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Like we very often see.

1553
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Yeah.

1554
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Maybe it is, but like, I think that that's probably also a lot around the fact that people

1555
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
like building glass cannons.

1556
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Like that is a thing people just like doing.

1557
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And so like the amount of incentivization.

1558
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And so then there's the issue of like, like, well, let me put it this way.

1559
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Even if right now, and I don't know whether this is the case or not, like it probably isn't,

1560
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:40,000
but even if defense was over-tuned compared to damage, I think that the, I think that you're

1561
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
still not going to incentivize people to do that until you get to the point where they're

1562
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,000
immortal.

1563
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Like, I don't think getting 80% of the way to immortality is actually enough even for

1564
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
people to still not want to build glass cannons.

1565
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
And so you've kind of got like that issue of like, it's just really, really hard to get

1566
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
that balance right.

1567
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:03,000
So the, like, that isn't to say that we won't try, but I'm just saying that like it, it,

1568
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
it is people, there just tends to be an erring on the side of offense for that reason.

1569
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And, um, I don't think either immortality or insta-killing bosses is right.

1570
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
So like, you know, the people probably concentrate on the damage more.

1571
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Yeah, especially, I mean, we have a bigger problem, especially with just in general,

1572
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
just thinking about it, like damage also now resulting in crowd control amplifies the

1573
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
problem even further.

1574
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Yeah.

1575
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Um, because that having the boss be heavy stunned and or frozen or whatever, like majority

1576
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
of the fight is just even more of a reason to just go ballistic on damage.

1577
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Um, yeah, there's a lot, there are problems here a hundred percent.

1578
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I have, I'm just thinking of random other things that.

1579
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Well, yeah, I have other questions about defense as well.

1580
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Um, so armor break, uh, I would say like effectively disables armor, right.

1581
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
As a defense for hardcore, it's sort of like when it comes around, it kind of like shuts

1582
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
down your main form of defense.

1583
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You're feeling like very tanky if you do invest into armor.

1584
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Um, well, ideally I do still armor needs a buff.

1585
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Um, but I guess the problem I have with armor break and fizz overwhelm in Peewee one is that

1586
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
it's just so crazy to me to have something effectively shut down your defense from time to time.

1587
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Um, so yeah, I, I, are you happy with armor break and fizz overwhelm being in the game?

1588
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Um, well, in Peewee two context, I am not happy with, uh, the current state of monster armor

1589
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,000
break.

1590
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
No, that is also on my change today list.

1591
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Um, so I need to, there's a few things.

1592
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
It was meant to be that they're breaking flat amounts of armor and that isn't.

1593
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So if the more you stack, the less significant the armor break becomes from the enemy.

1594
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I suspect there might be some percent, some sources of percentage based in there, which are

1595
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:47,000
just like.

1596
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
It disincentivizes.

1597
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I mean, it just means that the more you have, the more pun, the more you're relying on armor,

1598
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
the more punished it's going to be.

1599
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
So I just need to do a quick audit.

1600
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
There's not that many sources, thankfully, so it won't take long.

1601
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And I just need to make sure that it's working.

1602
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And then there are possibly cases where it is just doing too much.

1603
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And yeah, it's just like, it acts as an insane weakness, but yeah, I don't know.

1604
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
A hundred percent agreed.

1605
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
It is not in the right spot.

1606
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And, um, also on the today list, I need to make sure that, uh, uh, uh, we go back, get,

1607
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
get, get the community team to go back through this afterwards and make sure I don't forget

1608
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
about all these things.

1609
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
But, um, no, that one I already have.

1610
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
There's that and the speed and a bunch of these other, and arbiter and there's a whole bunch

1611
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:28,000
of stuff.

1612
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Yeah.

1613
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Yeah.

1614
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
We've gone over a lot already.

1615
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Um, do you think in the short term we could see just like a straight up number buff to

1616
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
armor while you're trying to work out a long-term solution?

1617
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Oh no, but I'm not talking about a long-term solution for the armor break thing.

1618
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I'm talking about it.

1619
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It'll be solved.

1620
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,000
No, no, I know.

1621
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
But like, that's what I mean for armor too.

1622
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1623
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1624
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Misunderstood.

1625
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Yeah, sure.

1626
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Um, I can't be able to immediately say that.

1627
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
In order to change armor, we'd need to be able to understand why it's bad.

1628
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And I don't think just changing the number right now is right for that.

1629
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Okay.

1630
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
That's fair.

1631
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Like, I don't think we've fully understood the issue there.

1632
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
We did a few things.

1633
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Like, we, um, there was some overwhelm on some bosses and we removed it.

1634
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:15,000
And there was, um, there were too many skills converting too much into element.

1635
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Um, and we, I think we, and we pushed back a lot of that.

1636
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
So like, it obviously makes the armor more effective against those abilities.

1637
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
And like, there's a lot more of that.

1638
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
We probably need to reevaluate as well, just across the board.

1639
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Yeah.

1640
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Um, uh, but that stuff's really fast to change as for just a global number shift.

1641
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
But that's an example right there of why just changing the number wouldn't have even helped,

1642
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:39,000
right?

1643
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Like if the problem is elemental damage, then making armor stronger wouldn't have done anything

1644
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
for that.

1645
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
So like, it's so important to understand the reason before we just make changes.

1646
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Obviously the danger there by moving more fizz is it then makes it worse for, um, non-armor

1647
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
builds as well, but that increases the power of armor differential to the others.

1648
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,000
And so there's, you know, it's got to be careful with that, but, um, well, maybe, cause I, uh,

1649
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
maybe, maybe there's something we can do more imminently.

1650
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Anecdotally, I would definitely love more access to different forms of defense.

1651
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And I know that is definitely an AEA problem where just not everything is in yet, but just

1652
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
to like, anecdotally running through my experience, I am a Smith of Catawba.

1653
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
So I have like the, the shared res and the, uh, shared max res.

1654
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
So I'm like, I'm 89, 90, 90.

1655
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Uh, and for a long time I was like 85, 86, 87.

1656
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
So very high alley res.

1657
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Um, and on top of that, I was wearing a cloak of...

1658
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Which means yes, currently moving more into fizz is probably going to be to your, uh, detriment.

1659
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Yeah, sure.

1660
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
But, uh, even with that and a cloak of flames, and I can't remember the name hollow something,

1661
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
but there's the, uh, the unique helmet with like 15% fizz reduction, even with all of that

1662
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,000
mitigation, I was like at the start of today's dream, I was, I was very rough until I got

1663
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,000
my fourth lab that I was able to like improve it a little bit, but it felt a little bit

1664
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
weird to me as a player that I've like my entire ascendancy was defense based.

1665
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I picked up every defense I could on the tree and I was trying so hard to get really good

1666
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
gear or two and it was, it was very rough on defense.

1667
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I mean, what I immediately probably will do after is I'm just going to grab your character,

1668
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
put it locally, and then just kind of just have a look at that.

1669
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
It's just so I can get a better exact understanding, but like, sure.

1670
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I can give you a snapshot before I, um, cause now with region, it has been, we don't, we can,

1671
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
we have, we have it all.

1672
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Don't worry.

1673
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Perfect.

1674
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
We can take anyone's character from live and just play with it.

1675
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
It's not a.

1676
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Perfect.

1677
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Yeah.

1678
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Uh, the region did make a big difference.

1679
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
But I'm still seeing, um, a lot of issues there.

1680
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Uh, another thing that, uh, has been brought up a lot and I thought was really good point

1681
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,000
was we see chaos damage very early in Peewee 2.

1682
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
In Peewee 1, it was like generally something we'd see a lot later.

1683
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Um, would you be open to considering something like the, uh, chaos soul core being a rune instead,

1684
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
something that we can like get early?

1685
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Um, it's definitely a big part of what makes Viper so scary is it's, it's almost impossible

1686
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
to get chaos rise early on.

1687
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Um, yeah.

1688
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Hmm.

1689
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Sounds like a sort of more of a hardcore related concern because in standard you wouldn't,

1690
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
like, it, it, it, it, it's just balanced to be okay.

1691
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
But in hardcore where you're wanting to definitely not die, it's like a different concern.

1692
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And I don't think we would have thought about it in that way previously.

1693
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
It is sort of a medium core concern.

1694
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Cause like, if you can't get past the boss, you're just stuck there.

1695
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Oh, sure.

1696
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
But like, I mean the damage, like, like it's balanced assuming zero chaos resist, right?

1697
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
So like, well, Viper's hard.

1698
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It is hard.

1699
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,000
It is a hard fight.

1700
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
That's just a side note that's separate.

1701
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
But like, in terms of just the fact, like the fact that it's chaos damage, I don't think

1702
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
is as relevant in standard play because like the, that we, we're balanced assuming you

1703
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
have no chaos resistance.

1704
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And so what does she do?

1705
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:02,000
That's chaos.

1706
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Obviously the big purple meteor storm that I want to make some changes to, cause it just

1707
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
creates too much mess on the ground.

1708
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
It's a little bit lacking clarity or that fairness.

1709
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
And then the spare things, right?

1710
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I'm assuming.

1711
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Um, so the way it works is aside from poison itself dealing chaos damage, uh, the only other

1712
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
things that are chaos damage are anything that is purple.

1713
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Yeah.

1714
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Right.

1715
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,000
So, so all of your green stabs and slashes, none of that is chaos and none of it should

1716
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
be chaos.

1717
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
It's physical hits.

1718
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
And then the poison, if it poisons you, then it is chaos damage.

1719
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
But because you, because the poison damage is based on the hit, your armor effectively

1720
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,000
mitigates the, um, your armor mitigates the chaos damage because it reduced the hit size.

1721
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Right.

1722
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Yeah.

1723
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Um, so yeah.

1724
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:56,000
So yeah, the, the meteor thing is a problem, but it's like more of a fairness problem because

1725
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
ideally you should be able to dodge that pretty reliably every time.

1726
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Right now, a bit of a mess.

1727
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
It is hard to dodge that.

1728
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Yes.

1729
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
But aside from that, it would only be the poison of which, yes, you're, you're, you're,

1730
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
other defenses would, I mean, armor in particular innovation would mitigate.

1731
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Right.

1732
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Um, but yes, I do.

1733
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
It is the case by the way that if a thing like the, any snake spitter that's spitting

1734
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,000
at you with some green poison thing that aside from the poison debuff, which I believe you

1735
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
said kind of wasn't that dangerous earlier in general.

1736
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And maybe there are certain cases where it is.

1737
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
It's definitely dangerous if you're playing an evasion character.

1738
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Like that poison feels lethal.

1739
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And that's once again, cause the armor didn't.

1740
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
The hit is never chaos damage.

1741
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Just to be clear.

1742
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Which in P.O.E.

1743
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
One it is.

1744
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
It's like half chaos, half fizz.

1745
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Yeah.

1746
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
No, I, I did not know that.

1747
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I fully thought the spears from the side, which a lot of people say is the most dangerous

1748
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
attack.

1749
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I thought that was chaos.

1750
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Cause it's very heavy.

1751
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Just fizz.

1752
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Right.

1753
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Okay.

1754
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Yep.

1755
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
This is pro, so that's probably just more of a viper is too hard problem.

1756
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Right.

1757
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Makes sense.

1758
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Um, I wanted to ask you a little bit about, she's for her.

1759
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Uh, I wanted to ask you a little bit about pushing, um, as a player, I experienced that

1760
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
sometimes like, as like, it's almost seems like decent to me, if I'm being frank.

1761
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Um, is there an option to have more source of push resistance?

1762
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Something, for example, like the, the more strength the character has or wearing heavy

1763
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,000
armor.

1764
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
It does seem a little silly to a lot of people that like people maybe have 300, 500 strength

1765
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
or are they wearing like full plate, but like, yeah, a lot of monsters are just pushing

1766
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
you around variously.

1767
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Hmm.

1768
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
It does currently exist as a concept of mitigating it, um, because it was meant to be more of

1769
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
a physical thing of, well, there's two things.

1770
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
There's like monsters pushing you because you literally cannot occupy the same space as

1771
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:45,000
them.

1772
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Um.

1773
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:54,000
So here we're, are we talking right now about monster charge abilities or are we talking

1774
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
about like a sword, like a sword swing?

1775
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
The, uh, the number one thing that has been noticeable for me is that like little, I think

1776
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
it's from an ant line maybe or something.

1777
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
It's like the little like yellow beast that like rolls on you.

1778
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Uh, that still does take you for a ride.

1779
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Sure.

1780
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Uh, in that case, that's probably just a matter of fixing that particular thing.

1781
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Like I suspect that the answer to this one is not, we need to mitigation really.

1782
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
It's more just like, we just need to look at places that are like just monsters that

1783
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
are bad and just fix them individually.

1784
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
There are certain things I wanted to do.

1785
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Like I wanted it to be, and there was, there were technical limitations here that we need

1786
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
to revaluate, but I want it to be when you were blocking or parrying and you got hit,

1787
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
you had, you got knocked less back because you technically did deflect them.

1788
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Right.

1789
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Uh, in the parry case in particular.

1790
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And like some cases there's just push direction, like maybe the ant lines.

1791
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Yeah.

1792
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And then some, that thing, the charges and things taking your ride has been like honestly

1793
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
the bane of my year.

1794
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,000
That's just a, that's more of a just specific setup of specific monsters and stuff like that.

1795
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Like is, is, um, did we fix, uh, what's his name?

1796
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Um, the lumberjack guy in theory, but it seems to regress.

1797
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,000
It still happens sometimes.

1798
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
It seems to just break everything.

1799
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I don't think, I don't think this is a like balance question.

1800
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I think it's just a technical, like, we just need to fix some places.

1801
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Yeah.

1802
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I just wonder.

1803
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
There is also some desync we need to fix.

1804
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Yeah, sure.

1805
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
There's also that annoying.

1806
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Yeah.

1807
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Is pushing something you would consider temporarily removing until you have fixed the issue?

1808
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Not at all.

1809
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:21,000
No, no.

1810
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
It will make the game feel like dog shit if we do that.

1811
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Like there's just lots of things that you need to have.

1812
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
You need to have some pushing in order to make work.

1813
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Like, I think it's more just specific monsters.

1814
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Right.

1815
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Okay.

1816
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I, I, yeah.

1817
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Okay.

1818
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I'm not 100% sure I agree with that, but, uh, we'll, we'll move on.

1819
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Uh, you, you, that's because you haven't seen it without it.

1820
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Like it's, yeah.

1821
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
That's fair.

1822
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:42,000
That's true.

1823
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
If we turn up all sources of pushing, it would just be, it would, it would, it would be,

1824
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
it would be a disaster.

1825
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Right.

1826
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Um, yeah.

1827
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Okay.

1828
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Um, so during early access, we've talked about like, uh, re-space and lowering re-spec costs

1829
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
and stuff.

1830
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,000
And I wanted to bring up the point that a lot of players are using a large amount of

1831
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,000
their gold on gambling.

1832
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Um, cause we are, a lot of people are falling behind or feeling behind on gear.

1833
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Uh, so I wonder if, if you would consider further lowering costs, uh, and even like reopen

1834
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:15,000
the conversation on ascendancy re-spec during early access, especially since you've been

1835
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
talking about, um, that you are going to be buffing things.

1836
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
So let's say somebody is like, oh, wow.

1837
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Flame blast looks really cool.

1838
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Uh, I would love to be able to try that, but the, maybe redoing the entire campaign again,

1839
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
which can be over 20 hours for a lot of people feels very, uh, prohibitive.

1840
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I do find it to be, maybe not.

1841
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I do find it to be very fucking cheap right now is the thing.

1842
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Exactly.

1843
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Hmm.

1844
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Hmm.

1845
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I can't say personally I've run into that as a problem.

1846
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Like I'll respect my character all the time.

1847
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I don't even think twice about it.

1848
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Like it's not been a concern really.

1849
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I guess it depends how much you gamble or not.

1850
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
It probably does.

1851
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Well, at that point, yeah.

1852
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
But even like, I'm saying even if you're just like early, so I don't think it takes that

1853
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
long to actually do a pretty substantial risk.

1854
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I have to admit that I haven't been gambling in my playthroughs really.

1855
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Hmm.

1856
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Like I was like probably about six months ago, I was doing that all the time and I just haven't

1857
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
really been doing it recently.

1858
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
When we did the like gold model and respect costs, we made, we had assumptions of like,

1859
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
here's how much people will spend on vendors and here's how much.

1860
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And there's probably it.

1861
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Look, those assumptions assume a perfect world of that person exactly doing that thing.

1862
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
And so, yes, if anyone was to stray from that assumption, they're now not going to be able

1863
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
to afford one thing over the other.

1864
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
What I'm actually hearing right now, by the way, from this and an earlier conversation

1865
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
we had is that I need to not be disenchant.

1866
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I need to do some disenchantless runs because apparently I'm not testing something that players

1867
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
are actually doing.

1868
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Like my runs are entirely like I disenchant every rare on my runs generally.

1869
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
And so if that's a different behavior, then I need to test that and see what the experience

1870
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,000
is like.

1871
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Because like the whole like there's not enough currency thing, there's not, you know, like

1872
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:05,000
stuff like that.

1873
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
And like saying, and if you're telling me that you're like selling your res and buying

1874
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
gambling all the time, and then you're also saying, you know, I've got to respect.

1875
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
It's like, well, this is just like a materially different play style that I'm not currently

1876
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:16,000
testing myself.

1877
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Right.

1878
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
So like, I think that that's what I need to do to see what's going on with that.

1879
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,000
And with the last point I made, would you, especially with the fact that there are going

1880
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
to be buffs coming during this, would you be?

1881
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I don't think that anything changes between early access and not early access regard,

1882
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:34,000
by the way.

1883
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Like, I think that if the argument is that it should, like, I think the argument is the

1884
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
same regardless of whether it's early access.

1885
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Like, I don't think the early access is a part of this decision regardless.

1886
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
It's just what is the price supposed to be?

1887
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
We should get it correctly.

1888
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Well, sure.

1889
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
But I'm talking about ascendancy respect was what I wanted to.

1890
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Yeah.

1891
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Otherwise it depends a little bit on the severity of the change.

1892
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
But like.

1893
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
It depends how, it depends partly also on just how much we change.

1894
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Without knowing the, you know, how big those changes are, because I needed to get in there

1895
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
and actually do them first and then make that decision, really.

1896
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Yeah.

1897
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Like, there are certainly options there.

1898
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:24,000
It is important to me to make sure that I understand exactly where I sit on the ascendancy

1899
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
class respect thing, because the moment that's turned on, it ain't going back.

1900
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Um, so that is blocked by me and I will take whatever is necessary on that one.

1901
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I understand it.

1902
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Um, well, it is more.

1903
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Can I ask you a question about it then?

1904
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Sure.

1905
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Um, do you feel like that?

1906
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Do you feel like it is absolutely necessary to have those both be permanent choices?

1907
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Because you already do have the character class itself be a permanent choice, right?

1908
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Oh, no, no.

1909
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And I'm like, I do understand.

1910
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Do, do be clear.

1911
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I am on the fence about this.

1912
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Like, I can't say that.

1913
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Like I play, I'm like, oh, I can't believe POE one has ascendancy class respecting.

1914
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Like I'm all for that as well.

1915
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
It's just, I'm all so off.

1916
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I'm also for the more permanent decision.

1917
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I'm just like, I need to find the variable that makes me be able to, or the articulation

1918
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
to be able to go one way or the other.

1919
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
And it's very easy to just fold on that.

1920
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Like very easy.

1921
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
It'd be very easy to just be like, ah, we're going to change it right now.

1922
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Um, but it's not when you have the things that you can't come back from, like you definitely

1923
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
want to be certain to some degree.

1924
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Um, there are some other staff that share the same sentiment as me.

1925
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
And I, I might just go and have a bigger discussion and actually figure that out.

1926
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
And like, it is true.

1927
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
It's not really fair to make people have to wait for that decision on my behalf.

1928
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I kind of was like, look, by release post early access, I will, you will have that decision

1929
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
one way or the other.

1930
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
And that must be the way it is.

1931
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Um, but yeah, fair enough.

1932
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,000
If the argument is like, if it's going to come up every single time, which is fair, people

1933
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
care about it.

1934
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Then I probably need to press the decision sooner than later.

1935
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:02,000
So, um, I'll just get that answered sooner and, and, and not, um, not have people wait

1936
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
so long.

1937
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Uh, hopefully, uh, for everyone's sake, it's the answer you want, but if it isn't, well,

1938
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
you might just have to deal with it.

1939
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:09,000
That's fair.

1940
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:10,000
That's fair.

1941
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Um, I think I was curious about like, so you went with the decision to keep that, um, and

1942
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
it's shield does not get bled.

1943
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Um, which is sort of like giving monsters a form to be immune, right?

1944
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Like it feels very similar to like, I don't, I don't think, I don't think that we've actually

1945
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
come to a decision on this really.

1946
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Like there, there, there wasn't like a, we, I think after the last time this was discussed,

1947
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
we never actually went back and talked about it.

1948
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:43,000
So I wouldn't say we've decided that it's more just that it just went in like that because

1949
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
we didn't get another chance to talk about it.

1950
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,000
So I don't know that we have a real answer as to what we want to do with that yet.

1951
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Okay.

1952
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Like we should probably will revisit that.

1953
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I personally am just all for changing it, to be honest.

1954
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Okay.

1955
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Well, sure.

1956
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Then I mean, I have no objection to that.

1957
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Yeah.

1958
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
We made the decision a while back.

1959
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Like, I don't see why it can't.

1960
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Yeah.

1961
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Um, I did want to bring up, if you do make it like that on players too, remember to put,

1962
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
uh, bleed immune on CI.

1963
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Yeah.

1964
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Uh, we will definitely change CI, but it is a thing that the players,

1965
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:20,000
are now going to have to deal with who aren't CI just as a light, you know, a note as a

1966
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:20,000
thing that will happen.

1967
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Yeah.

1968
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
But I wouldn't say that bleed is exactly breaking the bank right now.

1969
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Is it all?

1970
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
It was for a while.

1971
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
There was a period there where like bleed was just brutal.

1972
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Like what, what changed to make that not the case?

1973
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Like I'm talking pre-release.

1974
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Uh, it.

1975
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Like, do you remember when the fricking like prowlers and G1-4 bleed you?

1976
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
We had bleed on a lot more.

1977
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Yes.

1978
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And then there was some crazy damage multipliers on it.

1979
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Some that I can't remember why they were, but I mean, again, pre-release numbers, things.

1980
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Cool.

1981
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Um.

1982
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Which was also unfun, by the way.

1983
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah, I'm just saying like, I don't remember what happened.

1984
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Yeah.

1985
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Um, I have a question about ignite prolif, uh, specifically with the monsters needing

1986
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,000
to stand still for, or like needing to be near the source for two seconds, um, to be

1987
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
able to proliferate.

1988
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
It needs, probably needs to be on the, it's on the today list.

1989
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
It was actually on my yesterday list and I didn't quite get to it.

1990
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
So it sucks.

1991
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Um, I know we've had a lot of heavy questions, but I have a, a bit of a lighter question, uh,

1992
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
for myself, like, uh, how are you feeling about the current, like, blessed orb and diviner

1993
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
being bundled together?

1994
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I don't have a problem with it.

1995
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I mean, is there anything?

1996
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I would say I don't have a feeling one way or the other, really.

1997
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
It's just, how do you feel about it?

1998
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Uh, I definitely, like, I don't know if this is just a PoE1 player thing, but I definitely

1999
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
feel like it's missing.

2000
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Um, because, like, I, I would never divine an item, like, cause the divine is, it's a

2001
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,000
big investment, right?

2002
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Like, we use it a lot on, like, uniques or, like, when a, a main weapon is, like, in need

2003
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
of it, but, um.

2004
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Like, are you saying that, are you saying that you believe that, um, this is reducing the

2005
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
desire to actually use divines?

2006
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
It's just that I, I would never use it for just an implicit on an item.

2007
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,000
So it just makes an item feel, like, pretty much permanently worse than what it should

2008
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
be, I guess, is, like, my personal anecdotal feeling as a player.

2009
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Hmm.

2010
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:31,000
I mean, that's, hmm, is that partly also just because the ranges and or power of an implicit

2011
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
is just too weak as well?

2012
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Yeah, potentially.

2013
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,000
They're not, they're not exactly impactful in most regards.

2014
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Some are good.

2015
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Some are very good.

2016
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I can't say this is something we've really thought about.

2017
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Yeah.

2018
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
So that's just.

2019
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
It's just a thing that kind of happened and then, like, yeah, we honestly just went under

2020
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
the radar the whole time.

2021
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:52,000
So.

2022
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Yeah.

2023
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
If there are more opinions on that, I'd be, like, really happy to hear them.

2024
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Mm-hmm.

2025
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Yep.

2026
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Uh, it was just something I was curious about, so I'm afraid I'll bring it up.

2027
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Um.

2028
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
The next thing is about movement speed.

2029
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Uh.

2030
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
In Pee Wee 1, we have a lot more things like Whirling Blades, Frost Blink, et cetera.

2031
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And in Pee Wee 1, I feel like it's a bit more viable to completely forego movement speed

2032
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
on boots and go for, like, triple energy shield.

2033
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Uh.

2034
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
But obviously, movement abilities aren't in the same spot in Pee Wee 2.

2035
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Uh.

2036
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Is there ever a world where you either, like, think about, like, removing the hidden movement

2037
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
reductions on shield and armor?

2038
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Um.

2039
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Give, like, a implicit movement speed to boots or something like that, so they scale a little

2040
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
bit with, like, the higher bases?

2041
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Well, I mean, you're just, are you, are you just saying here just make movement speed on

2042
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
the player faster?

2043
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Uh.

2044
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:49,000
So, for example, like, one idea that I saw was, um, if you, let's say that some bases

2045
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
have 5, 10, and 15 movement speed, so, like, that the higher bases are slightly better,

2046
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
and maybe even, like, scale less, right?

2047
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
So that some of your movement speed is guaranteed, or make it, like, a lot easier to roll movement

2048
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
speed, like, increase the weight, uh, that it can roll.

2049
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Well, I don't necessarily think it's bad to have a base type that, where you've got a

2050
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
mod that, you know, that's somewhat mandatory.

2051
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Like, that's okay.

2052
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Um.

2053
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
But it sounds, like, because, but if you're.

2054
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Well, as a player, it just.

2055
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Like, like, like, if, if, if, honestly, because I mean, the thing is, in Pee Wee 1, are there

2056
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
really people going around?

2057
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Like, surely it isn't common that people don't have movement speed on their boots in Pee Wee

2058
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,000
1.

2059
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I don't know quite a lot.

2060
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I guess it's technically viable if you just, you reckon?

2061
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Yeah, quite a lot of, like, triple energy shield boots and stuff.

2062
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Right.

2063
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Or, especially different in Pee Wee 1, because we have the, um.

2064
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:38,000
It's specialized.

2065
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Influenced things.

2066
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Right, right, right.

2067
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Again, you've got seasoned, seasoned players, not like.

2068
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Right, right.

2069
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Yeah, not new players, sure.

2070
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Random.

2071
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
But, but it is an option, and it isn't really in Pee Wee 2.

2072
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Like, movement speed is a lot more mandatory.

2073
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:53,000
I mean.

2074
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I don't know.

2075
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I, to me, to me, like, I mean, sure, I do not disagree with the fact that there can

2076
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
be scenarios in Pee Wee 1 where that's not the case, but I would still say it's basically

2077
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,000
mandatory there for them, like, for most of your Pee Wee playing career, I would say that

2078
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
you're going to be wanting to get movement speed on your boots, you know?

2079
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,000
I would even argue, like, the single best boot in Pee Wee 1, which is the Ralec Kish

2080
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Impatience, they don't have movement speed on them.

2081
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
And, like, they're still considered, like, pretty much the best boot.

2082
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Right.

2083
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:26,000
But, I mean, isn't that fundamentally, then, just the back to, like, back to the question

2084
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
of, like, you want to move faster?

2085
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Yeah, for sure.

2086
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:30,000
It is.

2087
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Sure.

2088
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
So, I mean, I guess that would be the...

2089
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
So, really, it's kind of like that.

2090
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Move faster implicitly and less dependency on the mod, right?

2091
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Yeah.

2092
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
But, I mean, whether or not it's implicit or based on the mod or anything, it's just,

2093
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I want to move faster, right?

2094
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Like, it feels like that's really the core of it.

2095
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Which comes back to the, we need to have those discussions.

2096
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Right, right, right.

2097
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Yeah.

2098
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
It's similar.

2099
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:53,000
A difference in PoE 2 is that the implicits of uniques, especially things like life sprig,

2100
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:00,000
will scale into the endgame, where, like, if I find a life sprig on my level 80 character

2101
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
now, it's never going to be usable early game.

2102
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:09,000
But the explicits on life sprig, sorry, and a lot of other caster uniques and things like

2103
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
that, they don't scale either.

2104
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:17,000
So, have you explored the idea of the actual explicit scaling or the implicit not scaling

2105
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
so that you can find these, like, twink leveling uniques?

2106
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Like, what are your thoughts around the uniques there?

2107
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
I don't think we would want uniques to have the explicit scale like that.

2108
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
That's kind of not what uniques are about.

2109
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

2110
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
So, I just not, that is not a particular solution.

2111
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:41,000
The bigger question is about whether or not the implicit, the skill should or shouldn't

2112
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
level up with the item.

2113
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Well, I mean, it apparently does, right?

2114
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
It does.

2115
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:45,000
It does.

2116
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:50,000
But something that could be interesting is that if you find a life sprig on a level

2117
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
80 character, it can scale up to that level.

2118
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
So, it would scale with your character.

2119
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
That would make you feel really good as a leveling item, for example, that you can use it at level

2120
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
one, you hit level three.

2121
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I really don't like that kind of thing, the whole, like, item that just scales with your

2122
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
character.

2123
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Like, I don't think that we want to move in a direction where you'll have less, like,

2124
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
have less times when you put items on your character as you level up.

2125
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
That doesn't feel like the right direction to me.

2126
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
But there's also more whether, and there's a second part to that, which is whether or

2127
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
not life sprig should even have high level requirement ever.

2128
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Which is a more, I think that's come up a bit more.

2129
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
That's a separate question.

2130
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
That, yeah, it's come up.

2131
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I'm kind of not quite sure about that one at the moment.

2132
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:31,000
That's fair.

2133
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Yeah.

2134
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
There'll be more discussions.

2135
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
I mean, so actually, so one thing that was proposed, and as a central solution to this,

2136
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,000
is that just the, like, I feel like maybe you didn't like this.

2137
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I can't remember who didn't like this.

2138
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Someone didn't like this.

2139
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Because I proposed that we make it so that the implicit skill on Unix has, like, a cap

2140
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:53,000
level.

2141
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
But then that does level up as you go through the game.

2142
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Like, not, so it does not, sorry.

2143
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
It's not that it levels up.

2144
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
It's that, like, it is capped to the level of where you are.

2145
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Yeah.

2146
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
So that way, even if you get a level 80 life sprig, you can still equip it at low levels

2147
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
and then, you know, and then that will go with you effectively.

2148
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
And somehow I see that as different from, like, your items changing as you level up.

2149
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
That, to me, that's not, like, quite the same thing.

2150
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
So, like, that would potentially be an option.

2151
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I don't remember why we didn't.

2152
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
There was some reason why we didn't do that.

2153
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
But, like, it might still be on the cards.

2154
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:20,000
That's fair.

2155
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Wait, so you're saying if you find it at level 80...

2156
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I'm saying if you find it at level 80, it's a level 16 skill, but you can still equip

2157
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:27,000
it.

2158
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
It doesn't change the level requirement.

2159
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:33,000
But then the skill gets down leveled to the maximum that it can be for the...

2160
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Oh, sure.

2161
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I thought that's what he proposed just a second ago, but...

2162
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
No, no.

2163
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
He's talking about the explicit skill.

2164
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:37,000
No, no, no.

2165
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
There's a second thing there.

2166
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,000
The second one was that.

2167
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Yeah.

2168
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Yeah.

2169
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Okay, sorry.

2170
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Maybe I misunderstood then.

2171
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Okay, right.

2172
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Sorry.

2173
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
In that case, then, sure.

2174
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Like...

2175
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
I mean, I would personally prefer to just be like, you can drop a

2176
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
low-level life sprig, and that's you using a low-level life sprig.

2177
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Yeah, but I don't love that either, honestly.

2178
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
But I don't hate that.

2179
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Yeah.

2180
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I don't hate it.

2181
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,000
There's a part of me that also kind of liked the idea that there were some uniques that

2182
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,000
were more valuable to find at lower levels, which I thought was kind of interesting.

2183
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,000
But I don't know whether players actually like that or not, so that's just kind of like

2184
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
a random other thing.

2185
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:04,000
That's fair.

2186
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:05,000
But...

2187
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
I don't hate that.

2188
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Yeah.

2189
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Yeah.

2190
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
I was just curious, because we do find them a lot.

2191
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Another question is about the minion resurrect timer.

2192
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Um...

2193
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,000
It keeps resetting, like, the entire timer every time a monster dies.

2194
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
And, uh...

2195
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
That can feel very frustrating.

2196
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
So I wondered...

2197
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Yeah, just how do you feel about that?

2198
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
That the entire timer resets?

2199
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Well, if you don't have that, it feels a lot more frustrating, let me tell you.

2200
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Like, that was how it was until we changed it.

2201
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
And, like, it was so bad.

2202
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Because what happens is that, like, the monsters...

2203
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Your minions just die one at a time, and then they can never really accomplish anything.

2204
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
And it's just like...

2205
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Like, trust me, that was a buff, that change.

2206
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Like, that was a massive improvement.

2207
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:54,000
So, yeah, like, until you experience it the other way, like, yeah, like, you will understand

2208
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:54,000
if you play it the other way.

2209
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,000
There might be an intermediary there.

2210
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
I want to explore some options.

2211
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,000
For example, like, instead of resetting the entire timer, it adds to the timer based on,

2212
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
like, the cost of the minion or something like that.

2213
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
We might do something like that.

2214
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:07,000
But I don't know.

2215
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
But that's not going to fix the fundamental issue, which is that minions work best when there's

2216
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
lots of minions.

2217
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And so the issue that we had was is that you just get into a situation where they just

2218
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,000
trickle in and die one at a time.

2219
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
No matter what, they have to revive all at the same time.

2220
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
That has to happen, yes.

2221
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I'm just saying it could be that, like, okay, let's say everyone's dead but one.

2222
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Oh, I see what you're saying.

2223
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Right, right, right, right.

2224
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
So it increases a bit, but not as much.

2225
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
And so instead of, like, oh, all about to revive except for one, oh, he died.

2226
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
And now it's six seconds.

2227
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
That actually is viable.

2228
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And that maybe is a change we could make.

2229
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And, like, would you ever be open to adding a keystone that changes the behavior?

2230
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I was actually thinking about that earlier today.

2231
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
And I mostly, as, like, the troll in me was like, we should do this just so the players

2232
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
can see how bad it is.

2233
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Yeah.

2234
01:55:51,000 --> 01:56:00,000
But, yeah, that was probably a negative thought I shouldn't be having.

2235
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:00,000
No, that's fair.

2236
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I think a lot of people would like to see it.

2237
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Sure, sure.

2238
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
But, yeah, no, I think the thing Mark just said is much more reasonable.

2239
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Yeah.

2240
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
And so we should probably do something more like that.

2241
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Convocation.

2242
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Is that something on the table?

2243
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
It's, like, maybe a spirit skill or something?

2244
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I don't love it.

2245
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:21,000
That's fair.

2246
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I don't love it.

2247
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I'm kind of like, I could see a world where a reservation cooldown or you have to earn

2248
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
it or something like that.

2249
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,000
To go in, it would have to be different enough that players probably wouldn't see it as Convocation

2250
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:42,000
anymore.

2251
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Like, I suspect that's kind of the reality.

2252
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Like, as Mark said, you'd have to have some kind of conditions or you'd have to do something.

2253
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
And it's like, at that point, it's not even doing the thing the players want it for.

2254
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Anyway, so it's like, you know, like that being said, it might still just be better and there

2255
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
might be some room for it.

2256
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I don't love it.

2257
01:56:59,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Yeah.

2258
01:56:59,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Well, yeah.

2259
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I don't love it.

2260
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I know.

2261
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Like, I would much rather find a better solution to that issue.

2262
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Okay.

2263
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
When it comes to map completion, obviously there's been some changes this patch.

2264
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,000
But one thing that easily feels the worst is when there is one monster just like really

2265
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:15,000
far away.

2266
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And the checkpoint system doesn't really cut it there.

2267
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Would you consider making the completion of a map be like 90% of the rares instead of 100?

2268
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Because the bad feeling is very often tied to just one monster, the other side of the

2269
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,000
map.

2270
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
And I have to like do so much backtracking.

2271
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Well, I want to solve this problem.

2272
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
I don't know that that's the answer, but I understand the issue.

2273
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Like, there's been a few different questions.

2274
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,000
We straight up discussed last night that like just having the mini-map icons on always is

2275
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:49,000
probably...

2276
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
There was a discussion of doing the mini-map icons on all the time, right?

2277
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Because you're not going to miss the monsters if you see them.

2278
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
The main reason for that is like the current way it works is it's like when 200 remaining

2279
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
they appear.

2280
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
And on some maps, that's like you kill three packs and they appear.

2281
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
And other maps, it's like you've got to clear 80% of it before they appear.

2282
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
And honestly, that's kind of weird and bad anyway.

2283
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
It's just that we kind of want to...

2284
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Like, the main thing we're worried about with that change is the whole you just play on

2285
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:13,000
the mini-map.

2286
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Like, you're not even looking into the game.

2287
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
But I think that fear...

2288
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I'm very in favor of that.

2289
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I love playing off the mini-map.

2290
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Do we just turn off...

2291
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Yeah.

2292
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Literally just showing from the start.

2293
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Like, I love that initially, for sure.

2294
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:28,000
At least for me.

2295
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Ah, okay.

2296
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Sorry.

2297
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I thought you said you love the idea of not looking at the game and only playing off the

2298
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
mini-map.

2299
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I kind of do that anyway.

2300
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,000
One of the...

2301
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Like, when we were trying to find that in Video Crash...

2302
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Yeah.

2303
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
One of our developers tried playing with just the graphics turned off.

2304
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Like, they just had the mini-map and they played literally to the end of Act 2 with just

2305
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:46,000
no graphics.

2306
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
And they're like...

2307
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
And the funny thing was, I was like, what the hell?

2308
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
How did you even manage to get through two acts like that?

2309
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,000
And he's like, oh, Huntress OP.

2310
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I was like, okay.

2311
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Like, this is...

2312
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
So it is actually possible to play entirely with the mini-map.

2313
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
No graphics at all, apparently.

2314
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Yeah.

2315
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:02,000
That was fun.

2316
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I would love that.

2317
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I want to change that imminently.

2318
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:12,000
The thing with the 90% thing you're suggesting, by the way, there is like, let's say the map

2319
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
only has three rares.

2320
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Is it just two out of three?

2321
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Sure.

2322
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Is it round down?

2323
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Does it round up?

2324
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
If there's only two rares, is it literally just one?

2325
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,000
It would just enable seeing the rares on the map.

2326
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I agree.

2327
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
It's probably better just to do that.

2328
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I agree.

2329
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I like that.

2330
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Another quick question about Delirium.

2331
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
It seems very fast.

2332
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Obviously, we're a bit slower now.

2333
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Any thoughts on Delirium speed?

2334
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I very specifically made a number of builds and tested them just before this O2O release.

2335
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
And I was actually surprised how well I was doing.

2336
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,000
And I was like, okay, I thought this was a big problem.

2337
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
And I was like, I'll just actually go and actually test it myself.

2338
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,000
So it could be...

2339
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Okay, here's...

2340
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
I'd like to know a bit more here, I guess.

2341
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Which is like, is it certain maps over others?

2342
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Yeah.

2343
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
100%.

2344
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Like...

2345
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Because it's still expensive to donut, right?

2346
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

2347
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Which we do.

2348
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
And we do kind of have to balance it around probably the bottom...

2349
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Maybe it's...

2350
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Yeah, sure.

2351
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:18,000
There's probably a point where it's balanced around an assumption of being more acceptable maps

2352
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
instead of the worst ones.

2353
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
And so I just need to shift that assumption and then change it.

2354
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:27,000
But yeah, I did specifically personally test this on a number of characters pre-O2O.

2355
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
And I was actually surprised...

2356
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
I was like, I expected it to be way worse than it was.

2357
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,000
That being said, I wasn't using like a massive range of maps for testing that.

2358
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I was like, you know, probably five or six different things on many different characters.

2359
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
So...

2360
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Yeah, sure.

2361
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I will look at that as well.

2362
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
I will add it to the today list.

2363
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Yeah.

2364
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
It's going to be a big day.

2365
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Yeah.

2366
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Well, I appreciate you guys doing this.

2367
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:00,000
So, obviously, P.O.E., you're not necessarily tied to like the warrior being melee, right?

2368
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Like right now I'm playing artillery ballista.

2369
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Would it be possible to implement some sort of favored system that I can just tick like artillery ballista with a little heart on it?

2370
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:14,000
So then when I go to like level up those gems, I don't have to in the bottom left search artillery ballista and I'm ticked the...

2371
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I would suggest just having a tab for equipped gems would be the way to do that.

2372
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Yeah.

2373
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Like you just have a tab that just shows you the equipped gems.

2374
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,000
You just click on...

2375
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Perfect.

2376
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
And you level up that way.

2377
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Yeah.

2378
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,000
All the classes, then my gems, and then all gems is probably what it should be.

2379
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Yeah.

2380
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Another question.

2381
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
The Smith's Hammer ability.

2382
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I was watching...

2383
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I have not used it myself, but I saw Queen69 using it and it looked pretty painful with like a little like tink, tink, and then going out and hitting twice.

2384
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Any improvements to that?

2385
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:54,000
So there were meant to be some changes that were made to this that I even specifically spoke about, I think, with maybe Darth and Gazzy or whatever when we had that last one.

2386
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Yeah.

2387
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
And those changes didn't occur.

2388
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
They have occurred locally.

2389
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
They should be in a imminent patch coming out.

2390
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
But that's...

2391
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
It somehow got missed, I think.

2392
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Or I don't know.

2393
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I actually don't know what happened there, but that was a sheer mistake.

2394
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Straight up.

2395
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:09,000
All good.

2396
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Whenever...

2397
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
So there are multiple skills that can use chargers.

2398
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:19,000
A few players have reported that they might want to use chargers on a specific skill.

2399
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Would there be a way to deactivate that a skill uses chargers, but you still want to use that skill, but you don't want it to be empowered?

2400
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:31,000
This was something that came up probably about three or four days before we shipped, actually.

2401
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I mean, the obvious case is barrage on the huntress, right?

2402
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Yeah.

2403
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Like, whether or not you want to do that.

2404
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
So I think...

2405
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I'd have to look into whether or not this is going to be okay, but we could have a support gem that does that.

2406
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Like, give some other power boost that says it can't consume chargers or something.

2407
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,000
And then that way you could use that with barrage if you wanted to disable it for that.

2408
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Something like that.

2409
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
So I think that'd probably be the way.

2410
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
But I have to think about exactly what that should be.

2411
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
But something along those lines would be the way I'd do that.

2412
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
It should work.

2413
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Yeah.

2414
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I have a little, like, just interesting question about how do you feel like class identity revolves more around weapons, right?

2415
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Because, like, I'm a warrior build, but a lot of people inherently think, like, warrior is maces.

2416
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,000
But, yeah, like, the class identity is more around the weapons themselves.

2417
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I was curious how you feel about that.

2418
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Well, we explicitly moved to having 12 classes partly because of that, like, to make that the case.

2419
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Like, we want that.

2420
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
And this is actually was driven partly...

2421
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I mean, so when we were talking about, like, adding weapon types and so on, there was this thing where we were like, okay, if you're...

2422
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
You know what it actually was?

2423
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Okay, so we had the spear base type.

2424
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:42,000
And we're like, okay.

2425
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Because this is, like, way back, like, a long time ago.

2426
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:53,000
We're like, okay, what is going to make a person who selects a ranger ever switch to spears and do that?

2427
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
That's just incredibly unlikely to actually happen.

2428
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It's like, ultimately, the purpose of the classes at the start are kind of to give you a stereotype to, like, to go to.

2429
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Now, you don't have to follow that, obviously.

2430
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Like, everything's open.

2431
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:07,000
But giving players, like, a thing where they're like, okay, like, I know what I'm going to do.

2432
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Like, I'm going to do this thing.

2433
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
It's, like, it's kind of important for new players to have that happen.

2434
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,000
So I think it is overall very positive and kind of, like, why we did that in the first place.

2435
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:23,000
And, I mean, like, an evidence of that in POE 1 is, like, yeah, players who select ranger, like, even though there's all this whole thing about being able to become a melee ranger,

2436
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
like, a new...

2437
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
It takes a long time before someone would even experiment with that if they're a new player.

2438
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Like, they just wouldn't even cross their mind to, like, change weapon type like that once they've already started.

2439
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:37,000
So, effectively, just due to that, we needed to have some way to make it so that, you know, from the very beginning, you kind of know...

2440
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Like, you've got some idea in your head about what kind of thing you want to play.

2441
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Yeah.

2442
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Yeah.

2443
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:47,000
The next question is about corrupted items.

2444
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
And you added, in my opinion, a very fun, new, unique strongbox.

2445
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Actually, whoever made the Venter strongbox.

2446
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Chapskis.

2447
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Love that thing.

2448
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Please put it in POE 1 as well.

2449
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Coolest thing ever.

2450
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:03,000
But I find corrupted items a little frustrating, too, due to quality and sockets.

2451
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
I don't know if the answer is just, like, that they always have quality and sockets.

2452
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
But, obviously, it's items that we can't recombinate anyway.

2453
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
And I just want to hear your thoughts on a balance pass from that.

2454
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,000
It's very frustrating to get a really cool unique that is...

2455
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Or rare that it's effectively useless.

2456
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Yeah.

2457
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Something needs to change there.

2458
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Like, it isn't right.

2459
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:28,000
We actually removed some corrupted drops before O2O went out.

2460
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
And then...

2461
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Because we were like, wait, hold on.

2462
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Getting corrupted items just sucks.

2463
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Like, this isn't a good thing you want.

2464
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,000
So, like, corrupting an item of your choice is great.

2465
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Yeah.

2466
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Yeah.

2467
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
So, we just straight up...

2468
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
We're like, we need to just start removing the corrupted drops and find a different way

2469
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
or a different item mechanic or do something with them.

2470
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Yeah.

2471
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Yeah.

2472
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Cool.

2473
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Yeah.

2474
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,000
100% just, like, what is this random white corrupted item on the ground?

2475
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Like, that is never going to be of use to anyone.

2476
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Right.

2477
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Yeah.

2478
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
We just need to fix that, for sure.

2479
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Cool.

2480
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Is there a possibility of the runes being added to the currency stash tab?

2481
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I believe we would...

2482
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:07,000
So, what was it?

2483
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
We're adding a socketables affinity.

2484
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Yeah.

2485
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
We're adding a bunch of affinities.

2486
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,000
I think it's, like, socketables, fragments, which will include tablets.

2487
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Yeah.

2488
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
And, obviously, fragments.

2489
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Breach and or catalysts.

2490
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Cool.

2491
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Expedition and also logbooks and the currency.

2492
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
You know, we're adding a whole bunch of them.

2493
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,000
I think there's five, six, seven, maybe different affinities that we're meant to be adding

2494
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
within, like, you know...

2495
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I would expect to see that within a week, probably, is my, like, guess.

2496
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:35,000
We're not going to add...

2497
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
This is, like...

2498
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Currently, it has the whole, you have to have the stash tab in order to have the affinity.

2499
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
And we're, like, having to divorce that a little bit so that we can just have the affinities

2500
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
because the tabs take longer to make.

2501
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
And so, we're doing that work currently.

2502
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
And I would expect to have all of that.

2503
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:55,000
So, you can use your premium quads, whatever, you know, to stash all of those.

2504
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Cool.

2505
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I actually almost threw with all of my questions here.

2506
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:05,000
So, this isn't something, sadly, that I've been able to interact too much with.

2507
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,000
But I wanted to talk a little bit about recombinators anyway and just see if you guys have looked

2508
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
into it, looked into the data a little bit.

2509
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Obviously, I've seen a clip of, for example, Karin having, like, the 0.91 chance to recombinate.

2510
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
And, yeah, just...

2511
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
What do you guys think of recombinator use this early, basically?

2512
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,000
I don't think we've even had enough real experience.

2513
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

2514
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
That's fair.

2515
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Waiting for more info and data there, for sure.

2516
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I did worry that there'd be an...

2517
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:38,000
That people would start seeing those very low values because they're using extremely rare item modifiers.

2518
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Yeah.

2519
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Or numbers of mods.

2520
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
And getting, like, oh my god, it says less than 1% or less than 2.

2521
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
This whole system sucks.

2522
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
There was a real, like...

2523
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:53,000
It's interesting because, like, with recombinators, I feel like every time we've ever even looked at them,

2524
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
they've always got this thing of, like, this tension between, like...

2525
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Like, they're so OP and yet also they look so underpowered.

2526
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Like, when you...

2527
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Yeah.

2528
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
They've got this, like, horrible tension like that.

2529
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:07,000
However, what I do think that this system is, compared to the previous one, is so much better

2530
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
is that if you're using them for the, like, low number of mod cases,

2531
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
then, like, you can get relatively, like, relatively good weights.

2532
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
But we do have the ability to do more specific balance here if we want to.

2533
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
So, like, we'll just adjust it.

2534
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Like, honestly, I have to admit, like, I haven't even recombinated anything on live myself yet.

2535
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:26,000
So, like, you know, like, it's just not...

2536
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,000
It's not...

2537
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I can't really say anything about...

2538
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Yeah, that's fair.

2539
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
It's something I haven't...

2540
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Like, I just don't know how it feels enough, you know?

2541
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:36,000
There were two major item systems that I was, like, expecting to get a bunch of feedback on

2542
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
and then would calibrate.

2543
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
One was recombinating.

2544
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
And the other, which I am very thoroughly looking for,

2545
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
and maybe you have some opinions on it,

2546
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,000
is how the new map drop progression works.

2547
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
And I know there is two...

2548
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
There's one thing I changed last night,

2549
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:55,000
which is to make it a bit easier to get guaranteed maps from the fixed last rear and last final boss.

2550
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
But the other thing is there is currently a bug, which I saw,

2551
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
which is sometimes the boss's drop isn't plus one level.

2552
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:03,000
What?

2553
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Yeah, I don't know how that happens.

2554
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
But I saw that bug.

2555
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
But assuming those are fixed,

2556
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I am very curious to know and kind of just get people's, you know, feeling on that.

2557
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I've seen some people get through the tears very, very quickly,

2558
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,000
which is fine because they have proven that they can and that's fine.

2559
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
And they weren't at the whims of the RNG as much.

2560
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
But I'm looking for a lot of feedback on that

2561
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,000
and I'm hoping to start getting a bit more of that as people get into endgame.

2562
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I have anecdotally heard people telling me that they're happier with how endgame is now

2563
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
than how it was in 0.1.

2564
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,000
I have also heard that, but again, very anecdotally.

2565
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Especially when it comes to sustain, I'm the wrong person to ask

2566
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,000
because I was shocked at one of the previous podcasts

2567
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
when people were saying they were struggling with sustain.

2568
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
So I thought it was funny when you basically said skill issues.

2569
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Well, that was also the case for us, which is why we did this.

2570
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
So that's why we just were like, let's fully redo this.

2571
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
So I'm the wrong person to ask for about sustain

2572
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
and obviously there's no issues for me with sustain now.

2573
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I've talked to my community a little about this

2574
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:08,000
and it was pretty split with the new like how you unlock Atlas points.

2575
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
A lot of people didn't like it.

2576
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
I personally like it a lot more.

2577
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I had a strong dislike for the do 10 tier one maps, do 10 tier two maps.

2578
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
So I love the new way, but a lot of people in my community didn't.

2579
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
So you're definitely going to have to get more feedback there.

2580
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
I'm just not 100% sure.

2581
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
I think the issue that people in my chat were saying

2582
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,000
was that they were struggling to see the corruption.

2583
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
So maybe even like some sort of indicator of like,

2584
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,000
like not an arrow, but like more.

2585
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
When you say C, do you mean,

2586
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,000
when you say C, do you mean like out of the fog of war

2587
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
or in the fog of war?

2588
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Both, I guess.

2589
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Like, just like, do you know the way we have the beams

2590
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
towards the pillars right now?

2591
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Yeah, that's why I'm asking.

2592
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Are you saying just like physically you don't see them

2593
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,000
when they're revealed?

2594
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Just before the patch went out, we were like,

2595
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
we actually did go,

2596
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
do we want these to be visible in fog of war or not?

2597
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Yeah.

2598
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
And they were, by the way.

2599
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
And then we were like,

2600
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I think maybe actually we don't

2601
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,000
because you're going to spend too much of your playtime

2602
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
just looking in fog of war.

2603
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
And I wouldn't be looking in the revealed section more.

2604
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
And so that's why I did change it.

2605
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
So that some things are in fog of war,

2606
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
but it's like not that many.

2607
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
So towers and citadels being that.

2608
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
And then you could have like a very short distance,

2609
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:21,000
maybe.

2610
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Yeah.

2611
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:27,000
So we don't currently have a distance in fog of war.

2612
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:28,000
You can see it's just either it is or it isn't.

2613
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
And so maybe we can mess with that and have it be like,

2614
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
yeah, you can see, you know,

2615
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,000
some depth in or something like that

2616
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
just to make it a bit better.

2617
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:37,000
But yeah.

2618
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:39,000
But it's good feedback.

2619
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:39,000
It's good to know.

2620
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Yeah.

2621
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:42,000
So that's about the Atlas points.

2622
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
If you do get any more,

2623
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:44,000
and of course,

2624
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
if you happen to get a collective

2625
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:49,000
from your community in particular as well.

2626
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
And of course, people are going to post it.

2627
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:51,000
You have my discord as well.

2628
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Just tell me,

2629
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
because I'm very,

2630
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
very curious about the map drops

2631
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
and how people feel about now

2632
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
that it's like way more deterministic

2633
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
for both sustaining and going up the tiers.

2634
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Yeah.

2635
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Now, obviously not a huge amount of people

2636
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
collectively as in the end game,

2637
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
but like it's enough to start getting stuff.

2638
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:09,000
So yeah.

2639
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Yeah.

2640
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I'd really, really,

2641
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
really like to make sure we got that right.

2642
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
So if any of that comes up,

2643
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
just give me a yell.

2644
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I have one last question about P.E.W. 2.

2645
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,000
And then I have a few quick fire questions

2646
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
about P.E.W. 1.

2647
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:22,000
and then we're done.

2648
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
How do you feel about the removal of clear speed

2649
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
things like Herald of Ice,

2650
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
but then sort of adding it back in

2651
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:32,000
with effectively a few players

2652
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
were telling me the Lightning Strike

2653
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
and a Roa effectively just swaps it

2654
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
from Herald of Ice to the Roa

2655
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:39,000
and the Lightning Strike.

2656
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Well, I don't know whether or not

2657
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
the balance of those is correct,

2658
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:49,000
quite frankly.

2659
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
It's not quite like,

2660
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
there's probably misbalance here,

2661
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
100%,

2662
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
but it's not quite the same

2663
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,000
as what the Heralds were doing.

2664
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Yeah.

2665
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
But it is still a balance anomaly for sure.

2666
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Like I certainly have people playing,

2667
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
I know people who are playing

2668
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Lightning Archers right now

2669
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
and they're like,

2670
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
why am I suffering like this?

2671
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I'm going to swap to Lightning Spear.

2672
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Which I assume is what you meant.

2673
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Yeah.

2674
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Roa 2 made me promise to ask that.

2675
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Yeah.

2676
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
So it's pretty clear.

2677
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
It is their number one play build right now

2678
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
is Lightning Spear Amazon

2679
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
and for good reason, right?

2680
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Like it wasn't the intention to be like,

2681
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
we removed this thing and added this thing.

2682
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
That isn't intentional

2683
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
that it ends up playing that strongly

2684
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
and that powerfully.

2685
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
And it's like a clear,

2686
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
like, I mean,

2687
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
just use it in the whole screen and plugs, right?

2688
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
But the trouble we have now is,

2689
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,000
like, you know,

2690
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
this is people,

2691
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
what people are doing now.

2692
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Yeah.

2693
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
And we nerf that.

2694
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Like, you know.

2695
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
No, that's fair.

2696
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
The answer is usually that we can't very easily.

2697
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:49,000
That's fair.

2698
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
So, you know.

2699
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Yep.

2700
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
So, a few POE1 questions

2701
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
and then nothing.

2702
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Do we have a rough estimate at all for 326?

2703
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,000
I mean, are we telling people?

2704
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Have we said anything about that?

2705
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
I think last we said was

2706
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
around that territory,

2707
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
at least towards the later half of May.

2708
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:11,000
You cut out.

2709
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Oh, no.

2710
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Sorry.

2711
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,000
I said nothing.

2712
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:15,000
No!

2713
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I was just pretending.

2714
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
No, towards the end of May

2715
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
was what we last said

2716
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,000
and the intention is still

2717
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
that that is currently on track.

2718
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Obviously, all these things

2719
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
are kind of like, you know,

2720
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
up to within a two-week kind of band

2721
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
because, you know, things happen.

2722
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
That being said,

2723
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
if you're not hearing about things

2724
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
by the end of May,

2725
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
then I'd be very, very surprised.

2726
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
You should be, for sure.

2727
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Cool.

2728
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Yeah.

2729
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Awesome.

2730
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Any chance of WSC and POE1?

2731
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Have you thought more about it?

2732
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
It's not really a question

2733
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
of thinking about it.

2734
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
It's a question of, like,

2735
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I mean, I would put it in tomorrow

2736
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:54,000
if we could.

2737
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Yeah.

2738
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:00,000
The problem is that the character rigs

2739
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
are just not set up for it.

2740
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
And so I will just mention, like,

2741
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,000
kind of like the long-term plan here.

2742
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
So once every microtransaction

2743
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,000
from POE1 works in POE2,

2744
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,000
at that point,

2745
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
it will mean that we could then port

2746
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
the character rigs from POE2

2747
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
back to POE1

2748
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
and rig the old character models

2749
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
and items onto them.

2750
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,000
And that would then mean

2751
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:19,000
that we would have access

2752
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
to the animation library

2753
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
and everything that we have

2754
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
in POE2 in POE1,

2755
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
which would then mean

2756
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
that we could put WASD in, basically.

2757
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Okay.

2758
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
So what I'm saying is that, like,

2759
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
in the, like,

2760
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
but this will take a while, right?

2761
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,000
But, like, in the long term,

2762
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:32,000
this can happen.

2763
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
But, like, it would effectively, like,

2764
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
like, yeah,

2765
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
we always sort of imagined

2766
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
that we would take the POE2

2767
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:38,000
character rigs

2768
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
and port them back to POE1

2769
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
once the microtransaction

2770
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
had all been ported over.

2771
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Yeah.

2772
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
But it requires 100%.

2773
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Obviously, we can't turn

2774
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
a microtransaction off

2775
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
in POE1 you already bought.

2776
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,000
So, like, therefore,

2777
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,000
we have to wait

2778
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:48,000
until we've got full compatibility

2779
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,000
before we can do that.

2780
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Another thing is, like,

2781
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,000
we can't incentivize

2782
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
to make a change.

2783
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Yeah, yeah.

2784
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
And the reason for that is...

2785
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
That we have to rig everything

2786
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
to all the stupid

2787
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
POE1 character models.

2788
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,000
We currently have to...

2789
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Yeah.

2790
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
So the moment that we can

2791
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
finally get rid of those

2792
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
POE1 character models,

2793
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
like, character rigs,

2794
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
that means that it just

2795
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
reduces our workload

2796
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:08,000
a crap ton.

2797
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
So, yeah.

2798
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
And then at that point,

2799
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:11,000
we could add WASD.

2800
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
We've got a pretty large

2801
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
rigging department right now,

2802
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
and they are spending

2803
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
probably the majority

2804
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:17,000
of their life

2805
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
all rigging microtransactions

2806
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
to POE2 characters

2807
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:20,000
right now.

2808
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
That is what they're doing.

2809
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
So, I mean,

2810
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
eventually it will get

2811
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:24,000
to the point

2812
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
where that is the case.

2813
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Cool.

2814
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
I have the same question,

2815
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
but with pausing.

2816
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,000
So for POE1.

2817
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
That one,

2818
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I think that

2819
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
they even tried

2820
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:33,000
to do that.

2821
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,000
It was almost there.

2822
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
It was almost there,

2823
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:35,000
and then there was,

2824
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:36,000
like, a couple of things.

2825
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
So, like,

2826
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
it is our intention

2827
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
to get that in.

2828
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Awesome.

2829
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Another thing

2830
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
that I really love

2831
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:43,000
in POE2,

2832
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,000
the highlight effect.

2833
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Like, when I right click

2834
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
a transmute,

2835
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
and it shows, like,

2836
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
what items this works on.

2837
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
It's really nice

2838
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
quality of life.

2839
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Oh, right.

2840
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Well, I've been,

2841
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,000
there shouldn't be any reason

2842
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
we can't do that right.

2843
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Should be fine.

2844
02:16:59,000 --> 02:16:59,000
I mean,

2845
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I don't know why

2846
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:00,000
that would be a problem.

2847
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Yeah.

2848
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Yeah,

2849
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
should be fine.

2850
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Yeah,

2851
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
we can probably do that.

2852
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:06,000
100%.

2853
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Either we're just not

2854
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
going to,

2855
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
or it just won't.

2856
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Yeah.

2857
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:10,000
It won't just happen.

2858
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Cool.

2859
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Final question is,

2860
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Valorbs in POE2

2861
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
can change the magnitude

2862
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
of unique items.

2863
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Is that something

2864
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
we could ever see

2865
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
in POE1?

2866
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Well,

2867
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
the amount of work

2868
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
that it would take,

2869
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,000
so here's the thing,

2870
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:22,000
right,

2871
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:22,000
like,

2872
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,000
that for every unique,

2873
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
we, you know,

2874
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
have manual work to do

2875
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
to work out

2876
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
what to do there.

2877
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Yeah.

2878
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
And obviously in POE2,

2879
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,000
given that there weren't

2880
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
all uniques made already,

2881
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
like, you know,

2882
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
we were able to do that.

2883
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:34,000
So, like,

2884
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I'm not going to say

2885
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
never in POE1,

2886
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
but just the amount

2887
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:37,000
of work it would take

2888
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
to, like,

2889
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
look at the balance

2890
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:39,000
of every single unique

2891
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
and do that work

2892
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
would be quite large.

2893
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Most would take

2894
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,000
only, like,

2895
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:43,000
two seconds

2896
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,000
and would just be fine.

2897
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Sure, sure.

2898
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:45,000
But there's, like,

2899
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,000
implications for a lot of money.

2900
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Yeah.

2901
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Yeah, yeah.

2902
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
There's just a lot

2903
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
of uniques in POE1,

2904
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:51,000
right?

2905
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Like, a lot.

2906
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Awesome.

2907
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
That was,

2908
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
that was all the questions

2909
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I had.

2910
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Thank you so much

2911
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
for taking time to do this.

2912
02:17:59,000 --> 02:17:59,000
I know this was super

2913
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
welcomed by me

2914
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
and the community.

2915
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
We really appreciate it.

2916
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:03,000
I know it was a bit

2917
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,000
combative today,

2918
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,000
but I promise it's

2919
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
from love for the game.

2920
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Well, actually,

2921
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
so I,

2922
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
at the beginning,

2923
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I obviously got out of bed

2924
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:10,000
on the wrong side

2925
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,000
of the bed this morning

2926
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:11,000
because I was feeling

2927
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,000
a little bit angus,

2928
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,000
probably more than

2929
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I should have done,

2930
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
and I apologize for that

2931
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
because that was

2932
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:16,000
probably not great.

2933
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
But, yeah,

2934
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I don't know,

2935
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:19,000
for whatever reason,

2936
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I just kind of,

2937
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:20,000
yeah,

2938
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
as I said,

2939
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:21,000
wasn't,

2940
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I was just feeling

2941
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:22,000
a bit ugh.

2942
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
No, I appreciate it.

2943
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
I actually,

2944
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
you know,

2945
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:27,000
compared to most,

2946
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I think we came out

2947
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
of this one with,

2948
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:29,000
like,

2949
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
here's, like,

2950
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:30,000
actually,

2951
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
like,

2952
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:32,000
15 changes we're

2953
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
just going to go make,

2954
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:33,000
like,

2955
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:33,000
immediately,

2956
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
which is awesome.

2957
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
And some we knew about,

2958
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
some we didn't,

2959
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:36,000
and some,

2960
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
and a whole bunch of discussion.

2961
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,000
So, like,

2962
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:38,000
I actually,

2963
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
the value coming out of this,

2964
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,000
I feel very,

2965
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,000
very good about,

2966
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:42,000
honestly.

2967
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,000
And I'm hoping we can get

2968
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:43,000
all those,

2969
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,000
a lot of those changes

2970
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,000
and I'm hoping it,

2971
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:46,000
obviously,

2972
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
it'll help,

2973
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:47,000
but, like,

2974
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:48,000
it is,

2975
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
it is good

2976
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:50,000
because,

2977
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I mean,

2978
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:51,000
at the end of the day,

2979
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,000
it's just creating

2980
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,000
that collaborative environment

2981
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,000
between developer

2982
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
and player base

2983
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:55,000
that,

2984
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
and using users

2985
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
as the intermediary,

2986
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:58,000
and I'm sure

2987
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
a lot of these opinions

2988
02:18:59,000 --> 02:18:59,000
and yourself,

2989
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
you're part of that,

2990
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,000
but it is very important

2991
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,000
that we keep doing this

2992
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,000
because it,

2993
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
it will create greatness.

2994
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Yeah,

2995
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,000
no,

2996
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I really appreciate

2997
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:08,000
you guys coming here.

2998
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
I'm actually,

2999
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:09,000
like,

3000
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
as a rule

3001
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
from my podcast,

3002
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I actually took something

3003
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Jonathan said to heart

3004
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,000
really,

3005
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:14,000
really hard

3006
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
that I really liked

3007
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
and you said that

3008
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
you really like

3009
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
when the interviewer,

3010
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:19,000
like,

3011
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:20,000
when it's their questions

3012
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,000
and not just on behalf

3013
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
of others

3014
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:22,000
because they're able

3015
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
to do better follow-ups

3016
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:23,000
and stuff.

3017
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:24,000
So,

3018
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I've tried hard

3019
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
to focus on that as well,

3020
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,000
that it's things

3021
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
that I am able

3022
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
to do follow-ups.

3023
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:28,000
So,

3024
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:29,000
but yeah,

3025
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
thank you guys

3026
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:30,000
so much for your time.

3027
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Yeah,

3028
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:32,000
thank you,

3029
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,000
and thank you everyone

3030
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:33,000
for watching

3031
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,000
and playing.

3032
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
We appreciate it.

3033
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Bye.

3034
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Bye.

3035
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Bye.

3036
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Whew.

3037
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Try to die

3038
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
less than I do.

3039
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Okay.

3040
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I don't know

3041
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
how I did

3042
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:52,000
because I have not

3043
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
had chat open,

3044
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
so I don't know

3045
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
if you guys

3046
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
hate me now.

3047
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
but I can promise you

3048
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
that I did my best.

3049
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
That was my best,

3050
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:04,000
at least.

3051
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I thought you were

3052
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
a GDD shill

3053
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
and I was wrong.

3054
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Thank you.

3055
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Oh,

3056
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:20,000
thank you.

3057
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
That means a lot.

3058
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:21,000
I don't know

3059
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,000
if you're joking or not,

3060
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
but I really appreciate that

3061
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,000
because I saw,

3062
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:25,000
like,

3063
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
a lot of questions

3064
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,000
at the start

3065
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
and on Reddit

3066
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
where people were like,

3067
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
this entire thing

3068
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
is, like,

3069
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:33,000
pre-prepared

3070
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
and Ziz is just

3071
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
going to ask the questions

3072
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
he's allowed to,

3073
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:37,000
and I was like,

3074
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
these are all

3075
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,000
my questions,

3076
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:41,000
man.

3077
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I made these.

3078
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:44,000
So,

3079
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I promise you

3080
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,000
I did my very,

3081
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,000
very best.

3082
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Jesus.

3083
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Thank you so much

3084
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,000
for all the subs.

3085
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
I really appreciate it.

3086
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,000
I actually collect money.

3087
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Oh,

3088
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I got some more.

3089
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Thank you.

3090
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,000
I really appreciate it.

3091
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Oh,

3092
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
thank you.

3093
02:20:59,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Thank you.

3094
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I really do appreciate it.

3095
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
I hope you guys think

3096
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I did a good job.

3097
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:03,000
That,

3098
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I,

3099
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:05,000
I'm not saying

3100
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,000
it was the best

3101
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
anyone could ever do,

3102
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,000
but that was my best.

3103
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,000
That was,

3104
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
that was my best.

3105
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:16,000
That was my very best.

3106
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Um,

3107
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,000
it is hard to do,

3108
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
like,

3109
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,000
follow-ups

3110
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
and,

3111
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:22,000
and stuff

3112
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:22,000
in the moment,

3113
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,000
but I,

3114
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:23,000
uh,

3115
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
I tried really hard.

3116
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:26,000
You know,

3117
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
not reading,

3118
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:27,000
chatting,

3119
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
a podcast is so nice.

3120
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,000
I was able to,

3121
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:29,000
like,

3122
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,000
really focus on the questions

3123
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,000
and,

3124
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
uh,

3125
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:33,000
try to do follow-ups,

3126
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:34,000
but at least,

3127
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:34,000
hopefully,

3128
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,000
a few of the people

3129
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
that are really negative

3130
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:36,000
on Reddit

3131
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:37,000
or in general

3132
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
before that,

3133
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
hopefully,

3134
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:39,000
they're,

3135
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,000
uh,

3136
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:40,000
happy with,

3137
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
how it went

3138
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
and maybe happy

3139
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:42,000
they were wrong

3140
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
if they were wrong.

3141
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Um,

3142
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,000
thank you guys

3143
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
so much for the horse

3144
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
with the 50.

3145
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Jesus Christ.

3146
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
No Huntress questions.

3147
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Uh,

3148
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:52,000
yes,

3149
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
I'm fully aware of that.

3150
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
I haven't played Huntress

3151
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
and I do agree

3152
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:57,000
with Jonathan.

3153
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:58,000
It is,

3154
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
makes for a lot

3155
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:00,000
better interview

3156
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,000
when the person

3157
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
interviewing

3158
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
is fully aware

3159
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
of the problem.

3160
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:04,000
So,

3161
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:05,000
yeah,

3162
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:05,000
I'm sorry

3163
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
that I didn't have

3164
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,000
more Huntress questions.

3165
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:08,000
I didn't play it

3166
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
and,

3167
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:09,000
yeah,

3168
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I really agree with that.

3169
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Um,

3170
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:11,000
and I,

3171
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I think it's why,

3172
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
at least I,

3173
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I'm happy with how

3174
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I,

3175
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I did it.

3176
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Um,

3177
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,000
but yeah.

3178
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,000
It's gonna be

3179
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:25,000
curious reading comments

3180
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
about,

3181
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:26,000
um,

3182
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:27,000
how I did.

3183
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
But that was my best.

3184
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,000
I even,

3185
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:31,000
like,

3186
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
prepared beforehand

3187
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
with having Ventura,

3188
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
um,

3189
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
uh,

3190
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
make me mock questions.

3191
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
That was a tough one.

3192
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Oh.

3193
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Was that too combative?

3194
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I was a bit worried.

3195
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Like,

3196
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I,

3197
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I wanted to,

3198
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:51,000
like,

3199
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
make sure that I,

3200
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:52,000
like,

3201
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
follow up really hard

3202
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:53,000
on everything

3203
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
and talk about the things

3204
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
that I did disagree with,

3205
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:56,000
but I was

3206
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,000
a bit worried

3207
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,000
about being too combative.

3208
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Ugh.

3209
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Huh.

3210
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:28,000
I'm,

3211
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I'm tired.

3212
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I'm tired.

3213
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I just,

3214
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I had a lot of things

3215
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
I really wanted to ask.

3216
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Wait,

3217
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
do you think people

3218
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:39,000
are gonna call me

3219
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
a shill more

3220
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
or less after this interview?

3221
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,000
She.

3222
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Less?

3223
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
More?

3224
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Both?

3225
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,000
She.

3226
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Oh, no,

3227
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I'm,

3228
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I'm happy.

3229
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Nenevi,

3230
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
thanks so much

3231
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:54,000
for the 10 gifted.

3232
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:55,000
And the eyes,

3233
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,000
thank you so much

3234
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,000
for all the subs

3235
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:57,000
and resubs.

3236
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I have alerts off

3237
02:23:59,000 --> 02:23:59,000
at the moment.

3238
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Um,

3239
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:03,000
I really need to pee.

3240
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,000
You never pulled out

3241
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,000
your dick,

3242
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:09,000
to real.

3243
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Stank's just resubscribed

3244
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
for three months.

3245
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Great job.

3246
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Thank you.

3247
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Thank you,

3248
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,000
thank you all.

3249
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Thanks so much

3250
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
for the subs and resubs.

3251
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Maybe I should have them off.

3252
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Um,

3253
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
I super appreciate

3254
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:24,000
all the money.

3255
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:24,000
I really,

3256
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I collect it,

3257
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,000
so thanks.

3258
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Um,

3259
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,000
right.

3260
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,000
I'm gonna put

3261
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:34,000
another music.

3262
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
I think I did

3263
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
very well.

3264
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I found some cases

3265
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I need to play

3266
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
a bit of hardcore stets

3267
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,000
essentially as an option.

3268
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Sure,

3269
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:44,000
but like hardcore

3270
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:45,000
is a challenge mode.

3271
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I am cognizant

3272
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:46,000
of the fact

3273
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
that I,

3274
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:47,000
uh,

3275
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,000
take that on.

3276
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Um,

3277
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:01,000
you did well.

3278
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Started a bit too harsh,

3279
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,000
but it got diffused

3280
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:04,000
and it was a good interviewer.

3281
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Well,

3282
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:08,000
yeah,

3283
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Ventura did so well

3284
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,000
at pretending to be Jonathan.

3285
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:11,000
That was really useful,

3286
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:12,000
actually.

3287
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Okay,

3288
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
I need to pee.

3289
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:14,000
I'll be right back.

3290
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:15,000
I'm gonna throw some ads

3291
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,000
on you guys.

3292
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,000
For those that don't know

3293
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:17,000
how I run ads,

3294
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I run ads when I go AFK

3295
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:20,000
so that people that

3296
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:20,000
don't have ad blocker

3297
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
can't afford to sub,

3298
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
don't get ads.

3299
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Well,

3300
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:24,000
they do,

3301
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,000
but there's no content

3302
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:25,000
you're missing.

3303
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Anyway,

3304
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I'll be right back.

3305
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Thank you so much

3306
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,000
all for tuning in,

3307
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,000
by the way.

3308
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:29,000
I hope I,

3309
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I hope I made you proud.

3310
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Thank you.
