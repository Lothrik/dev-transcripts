1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
in three two one they should be able to hear us and now they should be able to see us so sorry

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
about the delay everybody we are here thanks for waiting and uh take it away gazi with the intro

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
all right hi everybody and welcome to tavern talk we have lost track of which episode this is but

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
this time we have jonathan with us yet again to talk about poe 2 how are you doing um pretty good

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
uh you know obviously the response to the uh live stream we did was kind of crazy um like the uh

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
yeah i mean i don't even know what we really expected but uh certainly we there seems to be

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
a lot of hype so uh yeah we're uh that's a bit scary but i think we're doing pretty well

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
oh for sure a big congratulations on the reveal it was fantastic the intro scene i think it blew

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
everybody away absolutely astonishing i mean dm what do you think about the reveal like i'm rating it at a

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
12 out of 10 so far it's been the best one yet i mean obviously everyone liked it i would say that

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
kind of expected it to be good because i was able to get the early sneak peek and you know

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
see it in la earlier on so when i saw i was like okay yeah this is going to be pretty well received

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
one of my questions i did have for you to go right into it we're going to do general questions and then

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
we're going to pretty much almost immediately go into like more specific questions and these are

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
questions mostly just pulled from the community that i really want the answers to but one of the

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
general questions that i had for you was it seems like there's been more and more an emphasis on

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
exploration and world building and path of exile too you know you saw things like the skulls on the

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
maps is one such example you've used for this before so i was kind of hoping you could walk us

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
through the process that happened when you guys started to realize we really want to have more of

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
a focal point on exploration in the game so i mean to start with with the story stuff like that i mean

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
like you know we really want to make sure that we're doing better than what we had

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
um in poe 1 with regard to story like a lot of people get through poe 1 and they never even

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
realize what it is like what the story even was but it's for exploration as well i mean like

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the there's just you really want to have that fantasy of like you know of well i mean you're

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
playing a fantasy game right like you're just like and i think exploration is a huge part of that

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
so there was a um thing that happened you know in terms of like the you know the icons on the map

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and everything like that there was kind of a moment when we realized that um people just uh

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
people actually didn't realize how much content there was in the game um like there was a situation

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
where like you know people like walk past things they wouldn't know that maps contain stuff so we're

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
like okay um you know uh when people are dying to bosses all the time there is stuff out there for

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
them to find they're just not actually finding it you know they don't know that it's there so um the

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
icon on the map thing was just like a really good step towards actually making it so that you realize

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
oh you know what this is actually a game where if i explore i will be rewarded and there's been quite a

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
lot of other things like that we've done as well like you know we've tweaked the random level

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
generator we've done like a like to make it so that you've got things like where when you if

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you come to dead ends we try to make sure that there's stuff in dead ends for you to find

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and of course there's this like the particular encounters that we have like uh you know like

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
like every area we try to have like two in some cases there might even be three like sort of just

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
like handmade like little things you can find and we're actually keen to expand on that as well so

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
um one of the things that i'm keen to do is to have a larger um a larger pool of these kinds of

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
things in the game than what you get um the first time you go through an area and they can be random

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and then we could even consider having it so that um when we do the uh you know when we go between

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
leagues the set of them that gets picked for each uh for each area could be randomly selected from

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
those like we don't have that at the moment but it's like something that i'm very keen to do because

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
um i think that you know obviously replayability you know it's an action rpg it's like a huge thing

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
um by having more of these things you just want so like every time you go through the campaign you

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
just get a feeling of like oh there's stuff here i haven't noticed before there's stuff there i haven't

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
uh that the you know like just little things and i think those little things really um contribute

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and we even started doing that a little bit um with uh poe one once we sort of realized we wanted

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
to do this stuff um even with poe one we started saying okay every league when we put one out we

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
want to have like 20 30 just like tiny changes to the campaign that we can do just so that next time

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you go through it you just sort of feel like hey um you know like here's just something random that i

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
never noticed before and i think that that's like it's funny because it's not really a headline

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
feature like when we're announcing the you know a poe one uh league it's not like saying oh here's

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
like a bunch of these little things uh like it doesn't really uh get anyone very excited but i think that

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
when you actually play through it there's just that feeling of like you know oh man i never saw

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that before and it just kind of gives you just a better experience so i think that feeling of just

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
like you know just finding random stuff is is is really important and we want to do that as much

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
as we can that's really funny that you mentioned that because like i don't know how many times i've

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
gone through the campaign i play the game for 10 and a half years and every time i see something new

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
i'm like how have i missed this after a decade of playing this game because it's not in the patch

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
it's always so surprising yeah yeah yeah um guys you want to go with the yeah i think we just jump

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
into we've made a list here to make sure it's structured because we have a tendency of asking

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
repeat questions in the past we'll try to make sure that's not happening this time uh so the next

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
question we have we're going to jump into is that a poe 2 is focused a lot on new player experience

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
eliminating a lot of requirements for going to third-party tools or third-party sites and a commonly

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
asked question is that if we're going to be able to search and look up say monsters and their

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
abilities in game sort of like a necronomicon or wiki in game can we expect to see this um this is

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
something that i'd be super keen to do especially because of the fact that some of the monster models

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
are so awesome you don't really get to appreciate them from game camera perspective like uh you know

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
so like every every every weekend um my friends come over um and i like to show them like you know

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
hey here's what we've been doing on poe 2 recently but the thing is i've got the tools

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
i can like open up the what's called the asset viewer and like hey look at this cool monster

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you know like show them close up and like hey look and there's also funny things like the animators

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
make all these idle animations uh for the monsters that you basically never see uh like with a bunch

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
of character to them and stuff like that that are really awesome and the players never see them

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
because obviously you never see a monster not attacking you um so like there's all sort of stuff

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
so one day and we don't have this in the game right now but one day i am very keen to make an

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
actual sort of beastery uh you know of of like here's all the monsters in the game but like you know

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
we can actually see the model and like appreciate it a little bit and then obviously when you do that

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that would be a great opportunity to be able to show like all you know various abilities and

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
things like that it'll be sort of handy i think for people who are wanting to play spectres and

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you know to be able to have a big list of all that stuff so i think that'll be a really cool thing to

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
do one day but yeah we don't have it at the moment i just think it'll be really awesome to kind of show

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
off the work of the artists who uh have made all these awesome monsters um and like yeah some of them

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
are really kind of gruesome like there's this random guy just to pick a random example called a pale

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
fishman and it's like this tiny little thing on screen that you barely even see but if you like zoom into the

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
model it's like this crazy like uh um like huge like warped thing between a human and a um uh one

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
of those angler fish with the like dangling light thing on it and like if you look at it real close

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you can see there's like a sort of screaming person kind of under there that like there's a mouth and

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
like the idle animation like is like kind of crazy with like all this like yeah like there's just stuff

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
like that in there that it's like um you know like you really don't appreciate that when you just

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
like blast past it and kill it in like half a second because it's just some random small monster so

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
yeah it would be cool for people to see that stuff what was the name of that because we can get the

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
idle animation when we're racing as a specter what was the name of it that's true it's called a pale

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
fisherman i actually don't even know if it's in the early access because um i think it might be an

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
act four monster um so uh yeah in fact and the other thing as well is when i'm when i give names like

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
these these are like internal code names that's like the name of the folder that someone put it in

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
rather than like the actual like law name in the in the game so uh i don't know if it'll even be

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
called that in the final version but uh you know yeah it's just uh it's pretty interesting to see some

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
of that stuff i'll see if i can find it speaking of animations i want to go off script here from

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
our list already and ask you about the cinematic uh was something that i want to make sure i ask you

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
about because it's kind of the first you know full like major cinematic that you know has really been

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
revealed so far so was it difficult doing your first cinematic and did you guys get the result and

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
the response you were really hoping for absolutely so yes it was definitely very hard i mean obviously

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
we've never done anything like that before um you know like i sort of had to i mean i wrote it myself

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and um like you know we there was a new zealand company um uh who we who we commissioned to kind

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
of uh to work on it um and uh they've done um obviously some cool stuff before but i don't think

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
they'd ever done like a thing that's this long um you know uh like on the on the sort of scale i guess

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
um so uh that was certainly you know like i mean they did a really good job you know right like it's

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
they it's really awesome but um yeah i mean look it's kind of like

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
i was really concerned right because obviously the comparison is like blizzard and all the crazy

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
cinematics like that and to be honest like the the quality of the animation is not what blizzard does

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
right like i mean they you know like we we do a lot of things in order to make it so that like it it is

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
like i want the content to be really awesome but it's like in terms of just the raw like you know

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
like amount of millions of dollars that they probably spend on these cinematics right like we don't we're

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
not at that level um so uh you know we're not there but i thought i just i was really hoping

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that you could get a feeling of like the world and the kind of you know i want to make sure that

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
people understand right from the word go that like there is a brutality here and uh you know like we

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
we're not sort of pulling any punches when it comes to um the kind of things you can expect in the game

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
um so that was kind of what i was going for um and uh the thing that i actually based it on um

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
is i was thinking about a lot about um uh you know the the riddick movies yes um you kind of got the

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
thing you know the classic like you know like a team of guys go in all over confident and then

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
they get picked off one by one that's kind of what i was imagining i was like okay how are we

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
going to do this and um the uh that's so that's kind of what i was thinking about as uh as we were

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
writing it i love that riddick series that was the first movie i introduced my fiancee to when we

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
first met all right right probably not the best choice and also it also has that sort of idea of

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the flip of um you know like the the you've got the the team you're following are like the bad guys

129
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
but you kind of think of them as like but they're kind of yet the main protagonists and it's like

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you get that flip at the end where um you realize that the the bad guy hunting them all is actually

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the good guy so yeah i was pretty i was pretty happy with that one as well pretty well done

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
pretty well it was fantastic so yeah that was it was a lot of fun absolutely uh moving on to the

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
next question uh for clarification this is a kind of a big one a couple mini questions in it

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
so for clarification can you explain how deaths in map work because there's been some confusion

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
on why six portals if you die you can't go back in as well as experience penalty still be anything

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
we'll start with those two yeah so basically when you die in a map um you can't resurrect uh in the

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
map and i think that that is okay like we discussed this quite a lot right because we were like we've

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
got six portals we could have it um so that you can revive six times like you did in pewe1 but the

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
thing we were really worried about is just compromising the combat like we just really don't want to make

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
it so that you um just just you know effectively like i mean obviously there's a limited level of

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
cheese but it's still cheese on the boss as far as we were concerned um so the reason for six

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
portals is it's still important that you're able to pull out six inventories worth of uh items from

143
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
a map if you're by yourself you know like you still want to be able to do that um and yet we also don't

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
want to make it just one portal with unlimited uses because once again that limitation on like the amount

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
of stuff you can pull out of a map i think is also kind of one of those things is important

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and there's also a slightly more mundane reason which um like seems a bit silly but you know the all the

147
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
map devices that we've already sold those are microtransactions that we need to support going forward in the

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
store uh and all of those have six portals we can't really change that so uh you know that's

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
kind of just like one of those things that we just kind of have to maintain backwards compatibility for

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
for that reason so um yeah there was a lot of discussion around this though but um at the end

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
of the day the main thing that won out as far as is we just don't want to compromise the combat we

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
want to make sure that if you know if you're going to kill a boss it has to be like one you know one

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
life you have to survive it you actually have to properly kill it um but of course we can make those

154
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
encounters harder because of the fact we don't have um uh you know a map boss in every area so um you know we get to

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
ideally have that uh that still being fine and what about experience penalty when dying is that still

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
going to be a thing with us um you know that's actually a very good question um when we so we

157
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
removed it from the campaign at the point where we um made it so that we added checkpoints and

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
everything and then at the time we were like oh but in maps you get six portals so therefore um

159
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
they still haven't it now i actually it's still there right now but i it's not something i've like

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
thought about honestly for like a little while now so it's probably good that i have another

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
conversation with mark about it to see whether we still need it the reason why i think i would

162
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
still like it is because not necessarily it's not really at the beginning of maps but as you get

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
towards the race towards 100 having death like set you back um so that you have to actually build

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
somewhat defensively when you're like racing for the for 100 i think it's kind of important so the

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
experience penalty is really serving a really important role there but i suppose the question is like

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
it may not be as necessary when you're talking early maps right like it's really it's really that from

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
like 90 to 100 where it kind of starts to matter that the death penalty is there as a thing so um

168
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
we could theoretically think about like you know i mean basically what i'm saying with that is like

169
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
we could fiddle around with the equation for it a little bit but yeah the purpose of it really is

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
to make sure that as you're um uh coming towards the end you know as you're getting to level 100

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
that like a mistake actually costs you something rather than just being like a nothing in the road

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
um in order for that uh in order for that race to 100 to actually be meaningful um because you know

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
like if you can just grind your face into the wall and still not losing experience and just like dive

174
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
you know it's like you get to 100 but you died like 2000 times it's like well did you really

175
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
achieve the same thing as the guy who didn't die at all uh so you know that that's kind of the reason

176
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
why it exists that's a fair answer uh the follow-up questions to this little chunk we got here is

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
loot and what happens when you're going in the party play in maps and what happens to the the loot

178
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
there in the loot split between the parties as well as what happens if x player dies what is the loot to

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
that player all right so um so okay a few things about this so number one we have changed how the

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
loot scaling works for party members and what i've actually tried to do is be a lot more intelligent

181
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
with regard to what types of items do you want to see more of and what types of items um don't matter

182
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
about having more of so an example of this is like um if you're talking about currency right

183
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
obviously you want uh double the amount of currency we've got two players because all players want to

184
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
take currency but this is also true for things like rings and amulets because rings and amulets

185
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
aren't kind of like uh specific to any one like person right like like like i mean obviously the

186
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
mods can make them either way but everyone wants a ring everyone wants an amulet if one drops

187
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
um so effectively we also do plus 100 for things like that as well but if you're talking about armors

188
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
well there are six different armor types and so if you look on average um you only need to increase

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the number of um armors by 50 in order to be able to wait is it even 50 it might be

190
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
okay i might be doing the math wrong here but effectively there's an amount of armor increase

191
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
that you need in order to kind of on average make it so that everyone's still getting the stuff they

192
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
want because certain players only want certain um armor parts of the pie right due to the strength

193
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and thing and uh for weapon types there's even more weapon types so the chance that two players are

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
actually using the same weapon type um is generally much lower so effectively what that means is that we

195
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
can not increase weapons by the same amount to increase other stuff so what that means is

196
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
is that when you um the sum total of all of that means that the stuff on the ground

197
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
from each player increases by some number like 28 percent if you actually look at it in raw drops

198
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
um but the actual what what makes up that 28 percent is like way more of the stuff you actually

199
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
want and not as much of the garbage that you don't want in order to make it so that you don't get the

200
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
crazy spam on the ground with party play that you uh previously uh might not might have gotten

201
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
um so i think that that system works very well in terms of just making it so that you um

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
uh you you get the right items in i guess it just goes to the general philosophy that we have

203
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
of uh we're trying to not drop as many things but make sure the things we do drop are more

204
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
important and better as you um as you go up so um that's kind of like the uh yeah as i said just

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
part of that philosophy there i feel like there was another part of the question that i've forgotten

206
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
now so maybe you can remind me what it was uh the last part there there's two more but the one of

207
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
them was uh let's say you're two players playing and one player dies what happens oh yeah on the

208
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
ground that belongs to that player so to say um so i think that so we usually use temporary i think

209
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
temporary allocation is still i'm pretty sure the rules for this are basically the same as what

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
they were in p we won um at least at this at the moment um so basically if you've got temporary

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
allocation on then the allocation will disappear and then the loot will just become allocated to

212
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
you know to be free for all once uh the timer expires and if it's permanent allocation then

213
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
obviously it stays uh like that although we definitely should make it free for all once you die

214
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
even if it's permanent i assume uh i don't know if i've actually done that uh oh it does work that

215
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
way in that case it'll just work then so it's just the same as in p we won in this regard

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
um so uh that that should be fine um so uh yeah i mean effectively like that um so yeah i wouldn't

217
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
say it's like changed a huge amount in that particular regard um but um oh yeah yeah so

218
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
actually what was the last part there uh last one has to do with trials now we've only seen sanctum

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and ultimatum version or the 2.0 version of it uh so the real question is two two ones one is the

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
sanctum no hit run and um the questions are what happens if one player dies if two players goes in

221
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and the other one is the reward system there as well i guess okay so this is one of these tricky

222
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
technical questions that mark would probably be better at answering because he knows the

223
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
exact details let me think about that um i don't know that i've even had a discussion about what

224
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
happens to the rewards and sanctum now generally speaking of course when we're doing things like

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
this when you're paying party play with a thing like sanctum um the uh like the map uh well sorry

226
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
to be technical the map owner but you know effectively the person who who paid the cost

227
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the person who uh put the key in um they're the person who kind of gets like the the progress

228
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
so they usually get to be the one who decides what the uh what actions to take and what rooms to go to

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
i believe though that if you um want to go through and ascend that they're all like you can both do the

230
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
ascendancy so that means if you want to do like the ascension at a party then that's absolutely fine

231
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
you get the reward there um but i believe that the items that come from like key uh the the chests

232
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and stuff like that um i believe that they belong to the person who paid the cost of the coin that

233
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
they that they used to enter um is my as my understanding of that i could be wrong about this

234
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but i think that's correct so uh yeah there's a few the i'm i'm sorry about this i don't have like

235
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
completely clear information about some of that stuff but um yeah uh that that's one of those

236
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
things that mark tends to be uh often addressing uh as far as working out those things mark really

237
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
is like so i one thing i should mention is that mark plays like i'm i could be wrong but i think

238
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
like 90 of the time when he's playing he's playtesting multiplayer so he's the one who really

239
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
cares about getting all that multiplayer stuff exactly right whereas when i'm playing i'm like

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
a solo player all the way right like i just for whatever reason i'm just like a solo player so

241
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
ideally with the both of us paying attention here uh we should make sure that things are good in both

242
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
solo and multiplayer but um yeah he uh you know he's got a bunch of designers he likes to play with

243
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
um you know i mean you know like the design team effectively like he plays multiplayer with the design

244
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
team all the time so um he uh he's the one who usually sorts out these like specific little

245
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
multiplayer details all right so since we're talking about loot there is one question that

246
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
people have related to loot due to some early access footage we've seen where there's like tier

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
one tier two tier three advanced gear etc so i was hoping you could break down what that's referencing

248
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
yeah so effectively um when you get um uh magic find gear so like increased chance of rarity

249
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
we wanted to try and make it so that the gear that you get from that um is better and not just in

250
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the way of just getting like you know more more rares i mean it does do that as well uh don't get

251
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
me wrong like you're still getting more rares more uniques and so on but we wanted to make it so that

252
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you could scale uh rarity by a huge amount not necessarily in a character but also because uh you

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
know when you've got a monster uh that you've juiced with various map mechanics all that stuff is adding

254
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
rarity and not quantity um so effectively to make sure that rarity is something that um that really

255
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
increases the power so um the way we do that is there's five uh and i don't know whether rishi will be

256
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
unhappy about me spoiling the exact workings of this but um there are five tiers uh to start with

257
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
that you don't see that you can't see that change anything because those don't change anything about

258
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
unidentified items but they do change the percentage chances that you get uh certain things so they uh

259
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
for example you're getting um uh you know chances to upgrade currency to higher types of currency

260
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
you're getting um like the chances of uh not not spawning items with uh base types that are lower

261
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
level than what you would need so effectively sort of clamping the base types that you're going to get

262
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
into like a smaller range at the top and like on these kind of things while also increasing like

263
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
uh you know magic and rare and uniques and stuff like that it also increases the uh like it starts

264
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
to open up like uh those tiers start to open up like what types of uniques can go into the pool

265
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and to be clear here there's always a chance that you can upgrade through these tiers regardless of how

266
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
much magic find you have right you don't need magic find to get this it's just that magic find is

267
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
effectively increasing the chance you upgrade through them and in total there's actually 10 tiers

268
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
overall but at tier um at tier uh five it starts to uh modify the um uh the the properties of

269
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
unidentified items and that's why we have to start marking uh the the uh the rares as being like and

270
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
so that's what so when it says t2 that actually means that's like t5 internally of what it's rolled

271
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and then so the tiers going up from there each of them say you know t2 t3 t4 t5 and um what those

272
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
what the reason why we have to say that is because when this item dropped we uh clamped the mods that it

273
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
can get to be uh in the upper tiers and the higher tier you get the higher they can go so if you get

274
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
a um uh if you get a t5 uh rare the mods that it can have are from a very very tiny uh portion of them

275
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
right at the top uh of all of the of all the tiers of those mods so you know that the roles you're going

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
to be seeing like the life you're going to get on the damage you're going to get on this kind of

277
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
thing are going to be uh top notch when you see that um so effectively um uh the uh if you if

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and and the reason why i think that's important to show is because you kind of want people to feel

279
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
like okay um like because the number of items that drop aren't really increasing you need a way to

280
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
see on the screen when something drops like how valuable is the thing that i just saw and so

281
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
showing those tears on the rares also really has that effect of like okay like if you see like you

282
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
know five or six t5 rares drop you know you got a really good hit whereas if you see a bunch of like

283
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
t2s you know you didn't get such a good one so um that's kind of important i think just to get that

284
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
feeling of uh of of of being important it's actually really interesting because we've been fighting so

285
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
much this thing of like like the way that you made like a way you can make drops in an action

286
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
actually feel good is just by dropping tons of crap on the ground um but the problem is that like

287
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
it really is kind of a like an annoying element because like while it can feel good it's like it's

288
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
just it people want then you know they want to use loot filters and they want to use all that stuff and

289
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
it's like okay well i mean that's great and everything and we'll support that and that's fine

290
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
but like ideally we can actually make it so that you don't have to worry about in the first place and so

291
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
you need to find a way to give people the hit of dopamine uh without having to just do that by like

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
dropping literally covering the screen i mean there's still room for like dropping a lot of

293
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
stuff right i mean like we want to make sure bosses feel like you know there's a good list of stuff

294
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
there but it's like ideally you get that by the value of the items like you know that the value of

295
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
that stuff is really good and i suppose on some level item filters are even sort of achieving that

296
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
anyway because if you're using a filter to get like you're not seeing very much anyway so it really

297
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
is all about the value so it's like it's impossible we just need to make sure that the game is doing

298
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
that as a matter of course rather oh filters oh sorry i did that oh you're good we only lost you the last

299
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
half second there okay so since you bring up the concept of loop filters this was a question we're

300
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
gonna ask later so i might as well bring it up now is that like official confirmation loop filters

301
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
sounds like art support yeah so they're supported exactly the same way they were in poe1 there's no

302
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
reason for us to drop support for something like that um and um you know if you want to use them you

303
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
can and i suspect what the main reason people will use them for uh in poe2 is not so much filtering

304
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
things away but more highlighting things that are valuable that um you might not otherwise uh recognize you

305
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
because like there might be higher base types or things like that like a lot of people have filters

306
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that like uh you know um highlight certain things that might be good for uh various reasons so you

307
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
know things that um have like some for example people might like want to be doing things like oh um

308
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
you know like i know that this uh you know like things like you know items having sockets and stuff

309
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
maybe you want to change the text color when that happens or things like that like there is little

310
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
there are icons and stuff for that stuff uh there but uh we try to keep things like relatively visually clean

311
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
um so uh and and and also we don't want to kind of make try to make too many value judgments for the

312
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
player about what um is important or not um so therefore we try to like not do too much of that

313
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
stuff but obviously players you know come up with their own schemes for what they think is important

314
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
um so then i suspect they'll use loot filters mostly for the ability to change how loot is rendered as

315
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
opposed to filtering it out i gotta say this isn't so much a question as much as a comment for me

316
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
personally but i really appreciate the approach of something you said there which is allowing the player

317
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
to determine what's important i find that to be like a very appealing sentiment so i hear that's

318
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
part kind of the reason i've been falling in love with the you know the poe game lately um anyway on to

319
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
the on to the next question here uh so this one is going to be an obvious one if i didn't ask everyone

320
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
would be mad uh so there's six classes uh that are coming to early access some of them have already

321
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
been showcased but they're not in there namely the druid and the huntress so i think people are curious

322
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
about are they coming soon what's going on with these classes yeah so they'll definitely be coming

323
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
relatively soon i'm not going to promise a date but uh certainly the next two classes you see will

324
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
be those two like in terms of in early access um we just at some point look we really wanted to launch

325
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
with those two classes we expected that we would be launching into early access with those two classes

326
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
but um at some point it was just like um you know the we and i think i've even said this before but we

327
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
really underestimated what it takes to finish a class i think um like uh it it takes a lot uh you know

328
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
it's because and the thing is it's it's like you make a bunch of skills and you're like oh yeah you know

329
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
made the skills that's the class right but in poe it really isn't because um you know you need to

330
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
make sure they can all be supported well you need to make sure there's uniques that support it there's

331
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
passive tree stuff that supports it it's like a whole thing of like getting all that stuff into a

332
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
good state it's like plus also the skills plus also thinking about all the stuff that can happen

333
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
with other classes and like how does it tie in all the mechanics like it's just a goliath task um so i

334
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
think the huntress and the druid are not far away um the druid we still have one form um that we still

335
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
need to uh get finished um so uh there's like uh that there's still some more skill work to do there

336
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
um the huntress uh i think we mostly have like working prototypes that we're happy with for most

337
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
of the skills but like there's still a little bit more to do but yes just all that other sort of

338
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
finishing work around like tying it into all the other systems making sure everything's good

339
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
um that we need to get done um and you know it won't take us too long but you know

340
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
at some point we just had to say like hey you know uh can we really do this for early access with

341
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
all the other stuff that we're doing and we just felt like we couldn't so um you know we we decided

342
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
to to cut for now uh get to it later and you know we make these kinds of decisions all the time

343
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
there's like a ton of content that's like you know we're trying to get it in we try as hard as we can

344
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and then we're like oh you know what we just couldn't get it in but i think um uh you know that's

345
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
just game development right but the nice thing is it's all sitting there right we don't throw anything

346
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
away uh we've got it all there waiting in the wings which means that there'll be a bunch of

347
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
content we'll be able to introduce really quickly when you say speaking of one forum sorry go on yeah like when you

348
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
say one forum could you like give us a number how many forums are we talking about so there's three

349
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
so there's three primary forms for the druid but there's a couple of other like random shape shifts

350
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
around um like the kind of you actually saw one of them right there's the shape shift on the uh on the

351
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
on the ascendancy the demon form um so there's a few other things bits and pieces like that around

352
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the place but um yeah this the druid sort of has three primary forms and um that's because we want

353
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
to try and like the um other classes we want to make sure that there's combos between the forms as well

354
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
um like there aren't just it's not just like a reskin melee right like each of the forms kind

355
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
of has like skills that have like things and we want to make sure there's mechanics between them

356
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that they can kind of you know the cross class kind of even within the archetypes of the class um

357
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
synergy like that so um yeah the uh the the the the one that's um no i'm not going to spoil it

358
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
actually yeah i'm not going to say anything about it go ahead go ahead no no no no no you're more than

359
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
welcome to yeah i've been it so this is probably a good time to ask this thing because you're talking

360
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
about uh you know the additional classes here um does that mean we can basically expect changes to

361
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the passive skill tree because obviously there's the six starting nodes now so when you add the

362
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
other classes there's going to be new branches i'm assuming added for each one of these classes at

363
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
this point or were they going to double down on previous ones so um yeah well i'm look i'm sure

364
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
the passive tree will receive massive renovations or through early access like i just have no doubt of

365
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
that um that it's it's every every time we change anything a huge passive tree changes are a result

366
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
um and uh it's taken a long time to iterate to even the point we are now and i'm just sure there'll be

367
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
more um and like the thing is until you really play it like properly you just don't even know what

368
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
you're what's missing um so uh you know actually one other thing i might mention just because um i

369
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
don't know if it's like hugely well known but um the starting area of the tree for each class

370
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
actually changes there's actually three variants of the starting part of each of each tree for each

371
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
class so effectively um we actually did this first when we were playing the witch and the sorceress

372
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
um so effectively if you're a if you're a witch you get one variant of the starting area and if

373
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
you're a sorceress you get another variant and then if you're neither of those two classes then uh you

374
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
get a there's a third variant that can go there so that all the other classes when they go there they

375
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
get slightly different stats again um and uh the reason for that is because um the initial reason

376
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
we did the witch sorceress thing is because there's this problem that you have with um where players

377
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
when they see a node that's got multiple things on it and one of the things does not affect them

378
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
um people just really don't want to allocate a node like that even if the values on it are the

379
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
same as what they otherwise would have gotten so when we first did this when we had one variant for

380
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
everyone um the uh the witch sorceress nodes were like plus eight percent uh or whatever minion and

381
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
spell damage right and we found that sorceresses even though a sorceress would just like would

382
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
otherwise get just eight percent spell damage sorceresses would just not take that because it's got

383
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
this minion thing on it and they don't want that so um by having the trees be separate it just sort

384
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
of prevents that problem um immediately and the other thing it kind of also was just like when we

385
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
realize that we can swap those two out we're like well hang on we might as well have a third variant

386
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
as well for other players because that will mean that there are some times when we have like balance

387
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
things that are a bit annoying we're like we can't make a node for a class in the starting area as

388
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
good as we want because that would mean that other classes would all be incentivized to go there and

389
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
take it because it's like too powerful if you know what i mean so effectively with that we can like

390
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
balance the what what the uh you know because it's relatively close to get to the adjacent uh classes

391
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
area um so effectively you can sort of just balance that so that it like kind of works a little bit

392
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
better so um there's not going to be anything in the starting areas that you like don't like stats you just

393
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
can't otherwise get right it's not gonna be like that but it's just more about like tweaking numbers

394
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and make a few cases like the sorceress and witch where we just have to make sure that you know for

395
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
for new player clarity we can make sure that it's like just the stuff they're going to want and not

396
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
the stuff for the other class um but as you get out of that then they all become the same but yeah

397
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
as i said we're making a lot more changes um as we go through too all right that was a very in-depth

398
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
answer there i actually didn't know about the changing of the starts that's uh that's an interesting

399
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
tidbit there okay so you did mention and you know i gotta ask because you said classes and content

400
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,000
coming to the game i am a notable blight enjoyer yep so you know i you know i'm gonna ask uh can we

401
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
hope can you tease me with anything give me some hopium copium that you know maybe blight can come

402
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
to path of exile too at some point well i will say this blight is a relatively easy league to add

403
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
compared to some others so when we're looking at leagues of like here are some leagues that we can put

404
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
in like relatively easily that is one of the ones that uh you know uh would be relatively

405
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
relatively simple for us to do obviously one of the reward system it previously had has now been

406
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
moved to a different thing which means that blight will need a new reward system and uh you know we've

407
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
got ideas for what we can do about that but we you know we we've got monsters we can use for it uh

408
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
we've actually got a bunch of environment art from act five that um uh that would suit blight uh

409
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
perfectly well uh i'm not sure if no have we shown any that no i don't think we have all right yeah

410
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
yeah well anyway there are some uh uh there's some there's some there's some stuff uh that uh we can use

411
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
very easily so it's the kind of thing that we could do relatively easily when we're looking to

412
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
add uh new league uh new leagues to the game so i'm just hearing blight login that's what i'm hearing

413
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
when you're saying yeah okay well that's that's good that's good news i'll pass it off to gazi

414
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
because i've been asking a bunch of questions related stuff i just personally want to know oh that's

415
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
fine later on in this podcast we're going to hit the minion rant sections don't worry about it

416
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
uh but we can start with um a classic simple answer question and it is how many ascendancy

417
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
ascendancy points are we going to get in total yeah so same as poe one it's eight uh eight points

418
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
so effectively you've got um the last uh the three you can get um throughout campaign uh three like

419
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
three sets of two i should say uh so six points throughout campaign and then the last one uh you

420
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
have to be an end game to be able to get all right the other question we have here is poe 2 looks

421
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
like there's a significant amount of ways to increase power on maps how does the juicing

422
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
compare to poe 1 for end game mapping now we saw a lot of it in the reveal but could you elaborate on

423
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
it um well so first things first we definitely want to make sure the juicing is still a thing

424
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
right like we were we were we before we did our whole end game push i think that that uh you know

425
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
in recent times i think that that would have been a big problem uh that we would have had where there

426
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
wasn't enough ways to juice maps um but i don't know that you'll be able to get to quite the level

427
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
that you can get in poe 1 uh certainly we want to make sure that it's it's big though um and like

428
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
it's honestly it's a little bit hard to say because you know the the way that this can go down i mean

429
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
look we think we can know like all the things but you never really quite know exactly how it goes until

430
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you get like master players because trade is a huge part of the economy for how juicing works like

431
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
it's like okay so we've shown people how you can overlap uh tablets and towers and all these sorts of

432
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
things like that and like get all these pants but the question is is the sustainability in a trade league

433
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
such that you can like do all of the juicing mechanics that po2 has to offer at the same time

434
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
continuously and i don't actually quite know the answer to that because as i said it's like

435
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
it's really a trade economy thing that you need to have to be able to say uh what they can do and the

436
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
juice is substantial if you can get everything all at the same time the question is can you do that

437
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
every map or can you do that only some of the time and i honestly can't say until the trade sort of

438
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
starts to happen um it i think it's going to come down a lot to just play and for us to just find out

439
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
like you know like once we hit that trade economy we actually start playing what does it feel like is it

440
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
working well um but the thing is we still want you to feel powerful and part of part of the feeling

441
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
of power actually is pack size right um like you need to have enough pack size so that uh because

442
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
you know because when you've got a bunch of aoe abilities obviously the more things they hit the

443
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
more damage you're effectively doing overall so like the more pack like pack size really is like a

444
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
way to make a player feel powerful and so that's why we need to have ways of juicing pack size and

445
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
we've got ways of juicing pack size in the game but then we also have to be a little bit careful

446
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
because um you know the the that that that is what can lead to things getting completely out of

447
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
control and they're just not you can't understand what's going on in the combat and things just

448
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
completely fall apart so um yeah as i said i we have to be careful but i think it is still

449
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
substantial like we you still need to feel like a god so you know i i think i think the juice will

450
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
be high but i do believe it should be lower than pwe1 at least by a little bit um yeah that's fair

451
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
on the topic of uh power and juicing things up as something that we've seen in many games throughout

452
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
the years is how games start a rpg games they start off kind of slow and more of a strategic

453
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
gameplay approach and then the the best patch just comes through the game evolves the meta of power

454
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
creeping and speed clearing just goes to crazy numbers and then everyone's upset when they're

455
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
then toned down or the number squish is happening so i guess the follow-up question would be if what

456
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
are the plans because i'm very confident there are plans to manage severe increase in power creep

457
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
moving forward so you don't end up in that category where you're one-shotting the entire screen

458
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
um i think that we just have to be careful and honestly i would say that in pwe1 we've shown that

459
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
we can uh i mean look pwe1 obviously did get pretty crazy but at the same time like we had a lot of

460
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
years like a lot of years where things kind of didn't go didn't didn't weren't like that and i think

461
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
that effectively i believe we can still maintain that um our numbers don't scale as fast as some games do

462
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
and they don't go quite as exponential which means that we're not going to have to be worrying about

463
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
trillions of damage or anything like that uh you know having um you know and like it's it's uh it

464
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
could be so i don't think we're gonna have to ever do a number squish or anything like that like we've

465
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
never really felt like the need to worry about that um but uh yeah i mean you know it's just a matter of

466
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
keeping keeping on top of it and there are certain people in the company who just um you know are just

467
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
are just very careful about stuff so i mentioned rishi a couple of times like you know he's kind of the

468
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
one who does most of the work for the item system and so on so he and he and he's and he is definitely

469
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
a force of conservativeness when it comes to uh when it comes to like making sure that things don't go

470
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
crazy and so that's really good to have because it means that like me and mark are often the ones

471
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
being like no no numbers high numbers high and he's like like no no keep them low keep them low so i

472
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
think together with that we kind of come to some kind of medium ground where we don't uh kind of uh get

473
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
things too out of control um but uh yeah as i said i think that it's just a matter of you know

474
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
just being careful um one nice thing that we also have is with the league format that we have is that

475
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
we get to add power and then at the end of the league we get to decide like you know was that too

476
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
much can we take some of this away do we want to keep it you know that kind of stuff um like that's

477
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
a very important tool um so we kind of never really like it means we don't have to commit to things in

478
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
the same way that the game that didn't have a league type process does um because the expectation

479
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
from players and i think this is almost sort of a community thing the expectation from the

480
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
community is not necessarily that all the content that we add is going to stay added um and i think

481
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
that's a really important factor to have an understanding of in a game community because

482
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
it just gives us so much more ability to like make decisions after testing them um and um it's funny

483
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
like you know i say that as if you know oh yeah you just test all of your stuff on the players but i

484
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
mean to some extent that's true and because the the you know you never really know uh like you can do

485
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
all the testing you want but you never really know until the community actually get a chance

486
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
to play with it and you see what kind of stuff comes out of it so um yeah i mean on some level

487
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
we really are testing the stuff on the community and it has to be that way i just don't know of a

488
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
way uh like no matter how many qa tests we throw at it i don't think we could find every single

489
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
possible uh level of power that can come out of something like that so um yeah like it's just nice

490
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
that we have the ability to say you know what um this thing here we're going to put it back in but

491
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
we're going to nerf it or this thing here just it can't exist like it interacts with too many other

492
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
things and it's too broken um you know it's really nice to be able to say that all right

493
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
um kind of a random question i have due to the use uh you mentioned this in the i think it was the

494
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,000
ziggy q a afterwards but that the early access server is going to be maintained so meaning you're

495
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
going to have leagues you know separate but then the og one will go back there and that is going to

496
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
be separate from like the eternal or core server as well right there will be an early access one so

497
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
question for you i have then is uh the early access characters one i'm assuming you can still

498
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
you know play them etc on the server or and two can you still create characters on the early access

499
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
server afterwards or are they kind of grandfathered in and make sure you have all the characters you

500
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
want for the um i think we probably won't allow you to create new characters there just because um

501
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
uh i think that even just if you're a new player and you're like oh you've got places i mean i suppose

502
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
what we could do is allow you to create characters there if you've already got one there

503
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
um that would be an option but um i kind of don't really think we need to do that like as i said the

504
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
main reason we're doing that is just because if you're someone who's like not even really paying

505
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
attention to what's going on and you're just like you've got some level 20 character and you're like

506
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
oh i just want to keep playing the game right we don't want to disrupt that person's life too much

507
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
um so i think that that's why we don't want to just get rid of all that stuff completely um so uh

508
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
yeah i mean the thing is though that like you know if you're playing a high level character almost

509
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
certainly your build is going to be bricked in some regard right like there'll be some element of it that got

510
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
modified or something like that you know um but then of course you'll also have like uh legacy

511
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
items um which will be kind of presumably funky assuming that we have to modify balance which no

512
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
doubt we will have to do um so uh yeah like you'll have all that stuff so i mean look there's just no

513
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
reason to delete the data right like we're not going to make an effort to make sure that everything is

514
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
you know like is is uh uh still works like in terms of your builds and everything but we're also not

515
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
going to do anything that we don't have to do in terms of deleting it either right like we might as

516
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
well just let it be there um so uh you know and it's also just like nice to have like oh here's this

517
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
character i got you know back in the day like it's nice to just have that around so uh you know it's

518
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
just a little memory of that so um yeah there's just no reason for us to delete it so speaking of

519
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:15,000
builds getting bricked if i reference one of the interviews we actually did on uh on here is you

520
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
had mentioned righteous fire as an example when we were talking about cosmetics and mtx and you're

521
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
saying that it's fundamentally getting changed and i was hoping to ask for pox here shout out to pox

522
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
can we get any information related to a righteous fire or where that is going it's kind of wanting

523
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
to follow up with with that that you had mentioned in previous so it's it's not an early access right

524
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
now because it's not a class that is not uh it's one of the skills for a class that's not going to

525
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
be an ea um so you get that a little bit later um but it is going to be in uh we have a we have a

526
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
prototype of it and you know we've got it working away that we're happy for it to work um but uh yeah

527
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
unfortunately just not an ea or at least not an ea at the start right when we add the character it'll

528
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:00,000
it'll come in it's going to be in significantly changed or or it is very different but it's still

529
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
fundamentally you know it's still fundamentally a thing where you're lighting yourself on fire and

530
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
there's fire damage around you and that kind of stuff right it's just that you know like the exact

531
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
mechanics from a stat point of view like if you looked at it on the screen you'd be like oh yeah

532
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
that's righteous fire but if you look at the stats it's like worked quite differently there we go

533
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,000
thank you i had to ask for pox fair enough speaking of uh uh bricking uh a very common question i

534
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
believe this was a scene is shown in the reveal but bricking the atlas as you can if you die in a

535
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
map you can't do it again and so in the start what happens when you break if you break all the

536
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
starter maps all around yeah yeah so we have the ability to re i think effectively restart your atlas

537
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
if you completely cut yourself off you can uh do that um i don't remember what way it is to do that

538
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
but it certainly came up when you're first talking about there just has to be some way uh to allow you

539
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
to uh effectively restart your atlas from scratch if you need to um i would hope that most people don't

540
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
uh do that um i should hope i should hope that you manage to survive it like you know when you so

541
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
there's four uh connections to the starting point um so you'd have to dive you'd have to dive four times

542
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
in a row in order for that to happen to you and then if that happens it'll automatically re-roll the

543
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
atlas so you can kind of just try again immediately but um yeah hopefully not too many players have to

544
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
do that uh and run into that issue um but uh yeah i mean look we wanted there to be consequences for

545
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
um for failure right we wanted to so it's like oh crap you know now i have to find another way around

546
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
like the the the web of connections is dense enough that usually there'll be some other way around to

547
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
get to something that you want um but then but bear in mind there won't be too many right like if you

548
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
then die uh at another one of the entrances to get to some piece of content uh that could uh that could

549
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
definitely cut you off so you know there are some consequences for death like um you know uh and

550
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
with that in mind it obviously means that things like the experience penalty at low level certainly

551
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
we don't need to be uh don't need to be as uh worried about because you know there's consequences

552
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
just from the death itself in the atlas but um yeah you know i think it's just a um the the reason

553
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
the other reason why it's also important to do that by the way is um because of the fact that you can

554
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
fail a map it means that the things that we can have on the atlas can be more valuable right

555
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
because if we have things that um uh you can just try again then you've always got these problems

556
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
where like okay if you uh go into the map like let's say you wanted to have a map that's just

557
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
full of chests um that uh that that that you know drop stuff for whatever reason let's just say we

558
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
wanted to do that right um it's like if the failure it really has to be that you can only enter that

559
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
map um they can only create that map one time um because otherwise uh you know like at what point do

560
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
you say well the map is completed um like there always has to be things like there always has to

561
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
be some kind of condition like that so by effectively just having the rule of like a map can only be

562
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
created by you one time uh it means that you know yeah the valuable stuff we can put on there like

563
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
monsters and things like that like if you could you could have mods on the atlas that like you know

564
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
increases the number of rares by a ton and that's fine because you know that you don't have a

565
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
situation where someone just kills half of them and then uh dies on purpose and then goes back in and

566
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
kills them again you know that kind of stuff like effectively like we have that's the kind of exploit

567
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
that we're trying to avoid here um and so it just allows us to have much more valuable stuff on there

568
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
uh we do by the way have a bit of this problem in campaign that we have to worry about like

569
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
uh because you know you can respawn a checkpoint at any time and so we have to make be really careful

570
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
about this stuff because you know i mentioned before that at the end of dead ends you'll get

571
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
rare chests well if you can set it like we had an exploit before we fixed it where like you know if

572
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
you get a if you get a checkpoint that's close to a rare chest uh because at a dead end you can die

573
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
on purpose respawn at the checkpoint just open the chest again and again um and so yeah yeah so

574
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
effectively what we have to do is make it so that when you um revive from a checkpoint

575
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,000
all of the things like uh like like like uh chests and rare monsters they have to stay dead uh even if

576
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
you opened them or killed them after you did the checkpoint um for the next version until you

577
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
recreate the map and get into it from scratch again because um that stuff uh would be exploitative if

578
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
you were able to um you know to not save that when you after you died so like a few little things you

579
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
have to worry about with the checkpoints for exploits that but thankfully um in maps you don't because

580
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
there's no you know you don't have to worry about that that element since you die you've done

581
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
i have a follow-up to that because i did i felt like when i played the test of the campaign now

582
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
the game is very different from when i played tested last time in la and there was one mechanic and i kept

583
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
saying gearing and getting skill gems it felt so good i felt like i always were given the tools i needed

584
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
when i was progressing and i had no idea about the mechanic till you told me at the event about this

585
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
um loot table rare that randomly was regenerated in the area and if you didn't kill it that would

586
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
that would be available in the next zone to give you like a flask so i'm guessing that feature is

587
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
also for this you don't you can't farm that i'm guessing but a lot of people don't know about it

588
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
so maybe you can explain elaborate on it yeah so effectively what we've done in the very very early

589
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
game in order to make it so that um to guarantee a certain number of skills and things like that

590
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
is that um there's a couple of encounters where if you um if you fail to find the encounter in the

591
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
first uh area for example then when you go to the second area we will drop the item that you

592
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
would have gotten if you'd found that first encounter just to make sure that if you didn't

593
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
run into this but you did run into a later one um then we like forward that on to the next area and

594
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
then we do that like a couple of times with a few different encounters kind of it's kind of all

595
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
stuff uh like in the first like sort of 10 levels this kind of stuff just to really make sure that

596
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
like people actually get some of those important drops like when you're level sort of 15 20 missing

597
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
out on one skill gem is like not really a big deal but when you're really low level and it's like

598
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
you've got very few skills if you miss out on that crucial upgrade of getting like the next tier of gem

599
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
um that can matter so much that we just can't really allow it to happen so we need to have as

600
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
many chances as possible uh for people to find those things but at the same time we didn't want

601
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
to just spam you with that type of gem because then it's like oh i've got tons of these well you

602
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
know like it would feel value like wouldn't feel very valuable if you if you did find them all so um

603
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
we want to all of those encounters they do have loot that you get like there's still a reason to do

604
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
all of them because they have their own unique stuff as well but effectively if you then but if you do

605
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
miss some of them you're still getting some of those really crucial things like gems uh skill gem upgrades and

606
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
things like that in those first few areas um i actually think though that some of that problem

607
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
might be slightly ameliorated by the fact that we've got the map now where you can see all the

608
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
encounters so i think that in some cases people might be looking at there but we still have that

609
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
system just because you know it's nice to be able to um you know to just make sure that people don't

610
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
fail in the very early game no so speaking of the map i got just a couple questions related to the map

611
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
one is when we're talking about uh you know breaking the map and not being able to go to certain areas

612
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
if you fail too many um does this account for like bosses too for instance like pinnacle bosses and

613
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
are they linked together where you fail the maps around it you cannot go do the boss now yeah

614
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:30,000
oh because if you fail oh sorry uh the cities with the uber bosses those are extra special because if

615
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
you fail um uh if you fail one of those if you fail to kill the lieutenant uh then the boss will

616
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
disappear from the uh the uber boss will disappear from the uh from the center of the city as well

617
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
um so those ones are like you really have to be able to do those fights and it will be quite

618
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
challenging uh that one of course is extra challenging because you need to find another

619
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
city right um so uh the uh that one's going to be uh something that i think will uh be quite

620
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
challenging um so yeah like that's for like the ultra pinnacle content like that seventh system which

621
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
has the uh the um the uh i don't want to say the name because we didn't spoil it uh but the uh the

622
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
the that pinnacle boss encounter um that one that one will be quite hard to get to

623
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
okay so speaking of pinnacle boss encounters got a couple more questions related to this

624
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
um are the bosses i hear there's what you said tier one through four correct

625
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
uh so you're talking about in terms of loot drops and things like that i think i've talked about this

626
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
before in terms of difficulty ramping i i don't think that we got clarity on whether or not you

627
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
can modify these maps meaning can you like modify the okay so you're talking about the uh the trees at

628
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
the end where you add the difficulty yes exactly yes yeah so yes there's four tiers yes that's

629
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
correct and and so beyond that can you then you modify the bosses themselves are the bosses static

630
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
and you modify on your tree only or are the bosses almost like maps you know how you can modify like

631
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
invites for instance from poe one so can you further modify these um so uh let me think about that uh so

632
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
generally speaking not so i'm pretty sure the breach stone can't get mods um can simulacrums get mods

633
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:13,000
uh i don't know i'm not sorry i'm not actually sure um uh ultimatum ones the ultimatum ones can

634
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
um because those ones have that extra mechanic for modifying him um i'm actually not entirely so

635
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
like look what i will say is in general um like it's not like the it isn't the same for every league

636
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
like for each league we can decide what we want to do there but generally speaking for those four

637
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
in gaming uh things the main thing you're going to be doing is modifying the um the difficulty

638
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
using the tree uh like that and um that difficulty scaling um uh does introduce things like you know

639
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
it can even modify things like how skills work and like you know the number of minions that a boss

640
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
might summon and things like that like there's all sorts of stuff like that um but it isn't random uh

641
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
what you're doing there on the tree um so uh for the for the for the for the pinnacles it really is

642
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
just kind of mostly just that difficulty uh change okay got it i think the reason people were asking is

643
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
they were wondering if like there's a hardest baseline challenge where it's like this is sort of a

644
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
baseline you can use on can you clear the hardest content so people were wanting some uh clearly

645
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
on that for the pinnacle whilst it definitely is the case okay thank you very much uh so another

646
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
another question i was kind of wondering when i was looking at the map i know this you use the example

647
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
of like the paradise for instance you get the bonus experience and that is obviously on the beach

648
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
because it's tropical so i'm assuming the uniques are zoned out to the biomes that you have

649
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
specifically and if that is the case the since the biomes are determining maps do these unique maps

650
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
also have drops associated with them essentially where i'm going with this is are certain biomes

651
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
going to help you target farm certain types of items absolutely and we want to do even more than

652
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
just what you were saying with the unique maps like we want like we have just certain map like this map

653
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
has got this theme and therefore it can drop this more of this item and stuff like that like we

654
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
absolutely and the thing is this is one of the great things about the new way that the atlas works is that

655
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
with the previous atlas we couldn't really allow for target farming in that same way or when we did

656
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
it was always a problem like with div cards and so on um where uh you know i mean obviously we

657
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
modified div cards you can move them around now but uh generally speaking it was the case with the

658
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
odd atlas that if we made it so a map had something special um then everyone would just play that map

659
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
continuously forever um so with the new system we effectively can say that you know it's okay to have

660
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
wild variants in between you know the value of certain things because you know you're limited by having

661
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
to find more of it and if you happen to know that the thing that you want spawns in desert biomes

662
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
and then you're using towers to find those desert biomes and then you're looking around okay like

663
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
finally i'm just going to go through all the deserts you can absolutely do that in the case

664
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
of untainted paradise that one requires being on the border of um the the water and um and uh the uh

665
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and a forest so only forests next to ocean um i believe will cause that map to spawn um and then

666
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
like we can do other things like that as well like we have special spawn conditions about like you know

667
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
when you get this and this that's when this can spawn uh and so that's like a way that we can kind of

668
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
like triddle around with the rarity but also if players learn these things uh then they can know

669
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
what to look for uh when they're exploring the map um as far as like finding that stuff as well

670
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
so that can be a bit fun so i'm assuming that's going to influence things like racing etc but another

671
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
another uh question i have in is does that mean that the people's individual map because you said

672
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
it's infinite it's you know generated etc so does that mean each person has a completely random

673
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
different starting point like for instance maybe i'm more prone to find tainted paradise

674
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
you know sooner than a different person i mean it is certainly true that you can roll well on

675
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
certain things like you know there's nothing limiting the fact that you could you could find

676
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
five untainted paradises near where you started and another person couldn't right but i think the

677
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
law of averages will just mean that uh in general it kind of ends up averaging up to the same kind of

678
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
thing um so uh you know i i like it is an interesting point that you make about racing because it does mean

679
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
that if you're looking about the race to 100 it is possible for one person to get luckier than the other

680
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
as far as what maps spawn for them but then by the same token it's possible for someone to get lucky

681
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
on what items drop for them or some other one of a million things so the longer you play effectively

682
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
the more the law of averages happens and the more kind of it just comes down to play skill rather than

683
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
randomness um but uh yeah ultimately you know everyone gets a different experience there

684
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and uh when you reset your when you when you do the thing where you run out of um

685
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
where you no longer have any nodes to explore by the way that does change the seed of your atlas so you'll

686
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
get a new random uh a new random layout as well um so uh yeah so that's just worth mentioning just

687
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
because that's good that's good enough so you can actually re-roll the complete layout if you want um

688
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
by dying four times uh well yeah but i think there might even be a way to do it without dying i'm not

689
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
100 sure on that i can't remember whether actually how they what the way to trigger this was but um

690
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
yeah that is a thing okay so atlas rolling meta coming up soon yeah but here's the thing right

691
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
because we we made sure we did think of the one thing like you're not going to get an untainted

692
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
paradise uh within the initial fog of war uh that you can see uh when you first uh enter the atlas so

693
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
you know like we're not gonna we don't allow that special stuff to spawn right in that first uh circle

694
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
so i do have one follow-up here before i send it over guys really because i'm just kind of thinking

695
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
based upon this concept so if there's certain biomes that are going to spawn certain types of

696
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
unique maps and maybe certain biomes are more prone to certain type of item drops etc but the i the maps

697
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
themselves i can't like take that untainted paradise put it as a consumable and then trade

698
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
it on the market does this mean you're expecting much more social play where it's like hey i found

699
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
this unique map who is expecting this unique map and having people actually looking for other players

700
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
that their particular you know atlas has the maps that people are particularly looking for is this

701
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
something you guys are expecting and planning around here i think i think it could definitely happen

702
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
for sure um as for whether that's good or not i guess we'll find out like it's really sort of hard

703
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
to know what the sort of social dynamics or something like that will be but yeah absolutely

704
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
it's something that i i have no doubt will start to occur and the concern with this stuff is always

705
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
um you know do you start to get um and sorry the name of the server of the thing is of the discord

706
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
server that's incredibly infamous is slipping my mind right now but uh you know the uh there's an

707
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
infamous discord server where people do trading for things like that and so there is a concern

708
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
that it's like you know i'm effectively trading uh access to um something like that

709
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
for uh you know out of game uh which is always concern but uh i guess we sort of decided that

710
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
we were sort of hoping that it doesn't end up going that way just and we're so excited to sort

711
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
of change the atlas over to this method that um this is uh you know just something that we decided

712
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
you know what i think we're willing to take the risk on that one uh but i mean it's sort of an

713
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
interesting one like if that becomes a problem we might have to find a way around to solve it um i

714
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,000
guess we'll sort of just have to see uh i mean look yeah we'll see what happens all right fair enough

715
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
answer i'll send it over to gazi i think he had a question uh yeah well we'll throw in one and

716
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
rewind back in time a little bit to an interview you did with a d4 streamer voodio and in there

717
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,000
there was a question regarding uh competitive game modes and races and whatnot community events with

718
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
you know with scissorin has the gauntlet event that's been very prominent with and the question

719
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,000
was about that being in pwee 2 and you answered yes now what we want to do is have you spill more of

720
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
the beans here and give us some more details can you give us anything are there any plans in the

721
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
works etc etc so at the start of early access we won't be able to do any of that stuff we just

722
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
haven't had time um but look it's definitely the kind of stuff that i like to do like i really like

723
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
those sort of pve but yet competitive uh type of events um like they're just really fun to me um so

724
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
uh you know i i have no doubt that we'll be doing some of that stuff it's just that yeah like for

725
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
early access we just haven't had time um the custom league system will come back in pwee 2 as well

726
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
so you'll be able to do that stuff and that sort of helps people organize their own races and things

727
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
like that uh which we'll have there it won't be once again not day one of ea but pretty soon after

728
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
that we'll get that in and like by the way the thing that's blocking that is literally just like

729
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
some of our web developers need to port the interface for that over to the path of xl2 website

730
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
right it just hasn't been done yet so we just as soon as i've done they've got that in order then um

731
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
uh then that'll be available so um yeah like we're absolutely going to do

732
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
i think a lot of people really like the the old school races that we used to have many many years ago

733
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
like the descent races i love that i love that it was 12 minute races like everyone can participate

734
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
in that because they're like the race to 100 we talk about that a lot right but that's a very like

735
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
that's a lot of dedication and time invested but these shorter races and an hour half an hour endless

736
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
dell like i think a lot of people would really like to see them come back again i i would as well

737
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
the funny thing about that was is that as cool as it was and as like much as the community liked them

738
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
for whatever reason it just didn't really result in people like it just didn't really result in like

739
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
actually more people playing and that was kind of the reason why we found like and like because so

740
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
it just it really sucks because it's like well this is one of those cases where it's just a mercenary

741
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
decision of like this while everyone loves it it just doesn't result in more players so that's like

742
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
if we're talking about spending time doing all that stuff versus adding more content to a league

743
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
launch that definitely adds more players unfortunately it just had to go to the leagues but the thing is is

744
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
that it was just really cool and so like if we had if i had some spare designers up my sleeve

745
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
um then i would 100 get them working on this because uh it's something that is just super awesome

746
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and um i look i what i i definitely think we should try it again as well for pwee 2 like you know times

747
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
have moved on a long time since back when we were doing that stuff so i think it's worth another try

748
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and see like does that stuff actually heat up into an actual um uh you know into into a scene of

749
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
racing and so on that actually like causes you know there to be like you know like like just interest in

750
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
itself coming to the um coming to the game so um yeah like look i have no doubt we'll try some races

751
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:27,000
um just not immediately and uh before i send it over to uh dm again yes or no are you in favor of

752
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:36,000
having a battle royale pwee 2 events uh well i mean it would certainly be cool let me think about this

753
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
is it more skill-based gameplay now yeah so i'm actually just thinking about this i'm just i'm just

754
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
thinking as you're saying this like okay so how how would the new system translate uh to a battle royale

755
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
format because one of the things that was interesting i think about the pwee 1 version was the like

756
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
the randomness of what skills you found i would in pwee 2 of course you've got the uncuts i mean that

757
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
probably is fine but i don't know it's kind of like it wouldn't really be hard to do to just try it

758
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
i think you know the thing with something like a mode like that is it's really easy to just like try

759
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
some random stuff but to really make it actually good would require quite a lot more work and um at

760
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
one point we were actually pretty keen to make like an actually good version of the battle royale thing

761
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
because you know when we announced that originally like when i said one day development it really was

762
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
just like you know like one like it was a limit of like one day per developer of how much time they

763
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
were allowed to spend on that because it was like literally an april fool's joke uh and it turned out

764
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
like it's kind of like one of those things that's like fun for uh like for for a few days uh but uh it

765
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
didn't really have like long lasting good gameplay because like no one had real i mean we didn't we didn't really

766
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
test it right we just kind of just like did some random shit and put it up there and it was kind

767
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
of cool um so uh that was that was a fun little experience but um we did discuss like should we

768
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
make an actual proper version of this like would this be something that actually works well and we

769
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
were kind of almost did but um i don't know just like other stuff other stuff happened we didn't

770
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
end up doing it but uh you know what maybe we should have another just like random fun battle royale

771
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
and poe 2 event just even if we don't like you know just another one of those just like ultra kind

772
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
of garage style just like you know everyone just hey everyone just like make some random stuff and just put

773
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
it in there and just see what happens it could be fun i think so i'll send a ball i used to do

774
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,000
i used to i used to do way more like way back in the early days of poe 1 i used to do just like way

775
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
more rando stuff like that um that and i really enjoyed doing it but um for various reasons like um

776
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
uh it's kind of like i don't know like i just never really like i find this stuff on so in a random

777
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
example of this is i was like okay you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna i'm gonna have a level one dps

778
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
competition so we had a competition for like what uh what what is the character that can get the

779
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,000
highest dps at level one and um then what we decided i think we gave away like we're like okay

780
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
if whoever wins this we're just gonna give like a t-shirt or something there was just some random

781
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
like prize that we were just gonna give away um and um i was like man this is really smart because

782
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
like if you use other characters to like rush your level one character but then make sure they never

783
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
get any leech any experience that you can like get all the quests and like get all of the like passive

784
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
points that you can get when you're level one and there's like quite a lot you can do

785
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and it's like then it's like okay what's the minimum amount of experience you can possibly

786
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
get by killing the mandatory bosses uh like uh in order to get the quest flags like it was like

787
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
all these like little things i was like man people are gonna have so much fun with this stuff

788
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and um then we got all these like kind of negative reactions about it of people being like oh you know

789
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
you have to cheat you have to moldy box to do this competition like there's like are you saying

790
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
you're endorsing doing this and there's like all this random stuff that the community kind of

791
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,000
reacted negatively about with this um because because i guess they were kind of feeling like um

792
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
oh you know like some guy who's like willing to spend all this time and like find the best level one item is

793
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
going to be the one who wins it it's like well yeah that was kind of the point right like i was

794
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
hoping that a bunch of people like some random like total basement dwelling people would be like

795
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
you know i'm going to spend like freaking a week on this and like find like what the best possible way

796
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
with like all these steps is going to be and then that person will get a prize right like it's just

797
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
a completely out there thing um and um you know that is what happened uh but for some reason people

798
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
got angry about it and i was kind of like you know um i guess i just don't understand like to me

799
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
that's cool it's like it's not like this is some big feature that we worked on right it was just a

800
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
random idea i had so like i i really love doing that kind of stuff and i feel like um you know

801
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
like it would be cool to do more of that but it kind of requires i guess a certain mindset in the

802
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
community so i don't know uh like there's always this worry whenever you do something like that of

803
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
like why are you wasting time on this when you could be doing some other thing right um so uh yeah

804
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
that's always that could be a concern

805
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,000
i missed all these i'm just sitting here thinking back because i think the reason this came up in

806
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
conversations on previous podcasts we did with pox pox was going through all of the different

807
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
battle royales and pvp modes and all these fun events and i realized there's all these fun events

808
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
that i missed out on being you know i knew her head to poe so i hope at some point those do come

809
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
back i mean you never would have experienced uh you never would have experienced descent which

810
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
was another one of those kind of like kind of relatively quick to make things that we did

811
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
where we just kind of remixed a bunch of content and put in a random order with like special

812
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
chests and everything and it was kind of a race event for a race that wasn't the game um and it

813
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
honestly didn't take that long to make um but uh yeah it was it was pretty cool it was fun it was

814
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
fun making all that stuff it was it was really fun it was it was incredibly enjoyable well what you

815
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
missed dm the best one was like we i remember you guys put the br into a twitch rivals and it was

816
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:15,000
just massive it was hilarious well plus one for minigames coming in the future um something that i

817
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
didn't maybe i'm just dumb but i didn't see it in any of my early play tests i didn't see it in

818
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
any of the interviews or any of the footage you guys showed gym quality is obviously a thing we

819
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
have like gym lean legionnaire for instance showing you plus quality obviously it's scale not support

820
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:35,000
was a difference made but how do you actually do that from my under i didn't see any gym colors

821
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
anywhere so i'm curious to know what's going on with gym quality and the impact that you're hoping

822
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
gym quality will have in the game yeah so effectively what we've done is we've made gym quality a late

823
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
game thing um because uh so it's kind of an end game that you get it um it's not restricted to any

824
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
one um system or anything like that but it's just something that starts dropping in end game only

825
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
and uh effectively um uh yeah they just increase like various things now gym quality was one of

826
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
those things that i think was a bit over complicated or like there was things where like we want to try

827
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
and do a little bit better when it comes to like what stats we're choosing to scale uh to make that

828
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,000
a little bit more fun um i don't have a full list of what they are anything like that yet um mark this

829
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
is actually something that's like coming in really late um like i know gym quality is a thing we're doing

830
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
um like like the balance of that has only been done in like the last few weeks um but uh yeah it

831
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
is a thing it's like a nice it's nice to have another kind of grind that's like uh you know just

832
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
to perfect uh to perfect the gym and there's even a few other things like that uh of like perfecting

833
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
your gems i'm there's one other one but i don't know whether it got in or not uh so maybe i shouldn't

834
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:41,000
mention it um but relating to that so um we'll uh no you can go ahead go ahead okay um you need to

835
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
have like quite a few different systems at the end where it's like okay you can just eat you can just

836
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
e-card another 20 percent you can eat out another 20 percent with this you can eat out another 20

837
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
with that right and so you kind of want to have a lot of those things so um the uh there's the there's

838
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
the role of uh fusing orbs which yeah that was the thing i'm i don't know whether it's in or not so

839
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
we'll just i'll just leave that as a cliffhanger there um there's uh things like yeah there's you've

840
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,000
got gem quality um you've got uh which i think i think is the 20 percent and then of course the um

841
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
gem legionnaire can go above that um now generally speaking it has to improve the skill by 20 percent in

842
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
some axis but we're not going to say it's not just going to be just damage like it's going to be something

843
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
ideally a stat like maybe in some cases but ideally it's always something that's kind of a

844
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
bit more interesting than that um so uh that's the hope anyway and uh because of the fact that

845
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
it's not just damage that means that we can um have it be um something that's sort of end game only

846
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
and uh the it's going to be harder to get than most other things because regular quality items you can

847
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,000
um get by uh by salvaging um uh from from other items that drop with quality but i believe that gems

848
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
don't drop with quality so every single point of that is going to be hard earned using a um a gcp

849
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
i jam cutters prism um so uh yeah that'll kind of be one of those just final grinds uh at the end

850
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
game of like getting all of those getting enough of those um and uh yeah i think that should be uh

851
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
just you know just one of those extra things that answers that um so speaking of skill gems there

852
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
was one other skill gem that we saw teased one time and then wasn't talked about again which was

853
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
mounts in particular uh also is going to the ranger right we saw the ranger but

854
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:13,000
two two questions here which is are there more than just the row amount and are mounts more than

855
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
just ranger can i be expected to be a titan double fisting two-handed maces swinging off the back of

856
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:25,000
a you know a rowa surely unfortunately not so uh the ranger the rangers are sorry the rower i should say

857
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
is a ranger well no i mean it's not ranger only but the the bonus that it gives is the ability to um

858
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:40,000
to to fire while um without slowing down um so uh only only bow well uh yeah only only like arrow

859
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
skills are ones you can actually fire off the back of a row um so anyone else could write it um but

860
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
it's not going to give you any advantage to do so because um you know it's just like you the main

861
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
thing you're getting is the ability not to slow down with arrows um so uh yeah it's it's not like

862
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
some larger system really it's just like a thing we made for that and you know we just thought it was

863
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
cool um and because the thing is we don't want mounts to be like faster so the reason why it's

864
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
faster for the ranger is because she gets to not slow she just effectively get to not pay the penalty

865
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
of slowing down while shooting but um we don't want mounts to just be faster than running in any

866
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
case because if we do that then it's like the whole different gameplay consequence and like uh that we

867
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
don't want to have to deal with um so effectively uh that sort of limits the number of things we can do

868
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
with a mount like that now i think it'll be cool later to do more mounts for more things like you know i'm

869
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
sure i'm sure there's ideas that you could have that'd be cool but uh at least for the time

870
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,000
being that's the mount that we've got and uh you know we uh won't be uh i am hearing for the sake of

871
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:36,000
role play cosmetic andy i do get to at least sit on the mount and walk around in town or something

872
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
like that sure sure and we you know we could probably make some cosmetic mounts as well that

873
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,000
were the same in that same vein i suppose uh nothing stopping us doing that so uh you know that

874
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
might be fun i mean on that topic i'll pitch you this idea obviously i want some royalties so i like my

875
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
skeletons to when they when i mount up to fall apart and the bones of the skeletons to form a

876
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
skeletal horse and when i dismount i want to deform the skeletons again okay

877
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,000
you will get exactly one cell it will be gossy behind the mount

878
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:16,000
i will be so cool um moving on to um uh assembling things question it's crafting related

879
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
uh so i don't want to spend too much time on this because the crafting is very different but it's

880
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
what we're going to see a lot when we play but i will ask a couple questions about it so let's start

881
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:31,000
with essences now we are uh confirmed to be able to use essences multiple times where they guarantee

882
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
a modifier what we've seen is making a normal item into a magical item guaranteeing one modifier

883
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,000
we've seen essences making a magic item a regaling essentially to turn into rare with a guaranteed

884
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
second modifier if you want to um so i guess the first question is regarding essences is this a

885
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:55,000
guaranteed specific modifier or is it a uh 1x speed modifier or 1x attack modifier yeah so it is listed

886
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:02,000
as a it's it's one of a group but in many cases um that that for a given item type um there's only one

887
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
mod of that type that could spawn anyway um so effectively like in those cases um there it's

888
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
completely guaranteed but there's a few cases where um it could be one of a couple of mods but

889
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
generally speaking uh for a given item type uh it will just be one mod and uh one the the main

890
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
reason why we did it that way um even though mostly it's just a single mod anyway is because we didn't

891
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
want to have the thing where you've got the giant list where for each item type it's like here's what

892
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
mod you're going to get and like this is kind of annoying so uh we just wanted to say like it'll give

893
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
you a you know mod of a certain group and then uh that way you can sort of know what you're going to

894
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
get from that um so uh yeah effectively um generally speaking though you're going to know what you're

895
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
going to get from the uh from that mod except for like yeah a couple of specific cases i think

896
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
okay on the follow-up there we talked about that earlier with the wiki in-game to search for

897
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
monsters talked about that a little bit earlier i guess another question in similar fashion we for

898
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,000
crafting is there any idea or desire or even plans to give us the tool to look at the tooltip in-game

899
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:03,000
of seeing these are the modifiers that can be applied to x to this item to avoid again having to go to

900
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,000
third-party sites and tools so we actually were going to have um so i'll give you some uh

901
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:15,000
i'll go okay okay so at the event that you even went to dm uh there was probably you might have noticed

902
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:22,000
the uh crafting bench uh that we still had in that version uh and uh that actually got cut

903
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
and so what that was going to be was not only was it a crafting bench but also it effectively served as

904
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
your um as as your uh encyclopedia of mods because you could see when you put an item in there exactly

905
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
what mods could actually go on it because the the user interface not only sort of had the crafting

906
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
thing but it also had kind of like the the you know like here's the mods that can spawn and like

907
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
sure some of them grayed out because you can't um uh you you can't you can't craft them on this item

908
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
but you could at least see what they were so we actually kind of were working towards something

909
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
like that but the problem was that the crafting bench had all sorts of issues which i mean i could go into

910
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,000
if you want but like uh but suffice to say the issue the feature got cut and so now we currently don't have

911
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
something like that um and that's a bit of a shame because i do think that being able to see that

912
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
stuff in game is good and like we were actually doing something useful with that um so uh it's

913
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
possible that we might bring something like that back a little bit later like we did a bunch of ui work

914
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
to kind of get this to be the case uh and i do think that it's good to have that stuff in game it's

915
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:19,000
just that we don't currently have that for mods um and uh yeah that's a bit of a shame i mean

916
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:25,000
go ahead sorry you won't go ahead okay i was gonna say you know uh not to dive into

917
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
the reasons for the cut of the crafting bench as much as to do you still expect it to come or is

918
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
it a decision like we shouldn't have this in the game as much as like we it's not rady technically

919
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
there's bugs or something you know it's like a to be determined or it's like no firm decision

920
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
it was a design problem not a uh not a technical problem so i might as well just go into it right

921
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
might as well just go through the whole thing so effectively um we had this whole so during betas

922
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
actually we had a lot of feedback um all the time about people saying um i don't have a way you're

923
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
not giving me the tools to um to fix the problems that i have with my build right and um the type

924
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
of player that we were getting that from a lot was up here we won players right because they're used to

925
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
the crafting bench um and the crafting bench absolutely is a way uh to be able to fix problems

926
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:15,000
with your build so um the first way that we um uh i'm trying to think back so so the problems that we

927
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
had with the crafting bench um is it kind of trivialized certain mods and the other the other the

928
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
the issue the designers often have is like okay effectively what it does is because the mods you

929
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
can get from the crafting bench are kind of like they're not top tier but they are kind of good

930
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,000
enough i guess um so it meant that effectively a rare item was only six so it was only five mods

931
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
plus a crafted mod and that sort of reduces the amount of um of of power you can get at the top

932
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
end on some level or like like the level or the degree to which randomness can cause an item to be

933
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
good relative to the average item which some people would say is a good thing right like or and some

934
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
people would say is a bad thing but the point is there was always this contention around this

935
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
right with the designers and so on um so that was like sort of one of the issues so then um

936
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
the other issue was uh just the way the costing was i think it was just like i can't remember exactly

937
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
what we're unhappy about with that but effectively we're unhappy about that so we come up with another

938
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
design and the first design of it was what we're going to do is we're going to say that um whenever

939
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
you get an item you can salvage a mod off an item that will destroy the item and then you'll get

940
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
some kind of juice of that mod or like maybe some kind of essence or something like that like

941
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
was you know effectively you'd get some kind of amount of like something for that mod and then

942
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
you would build up to the point where you can then put that mod on another piece of gear

943
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
so um we uh tried this out and um the problem that we were having was is that if uh we tried like

944
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,000
five different ways that this could work um in terms of like how it could work and generally speaking

945
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
there was always this fight every single time of like if we make this like easy enough so that players

946
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
can easily do it then the designers start to get unhappy about the fact that items are becoming too trivial

947
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
like we're not happy about this like all these sort of issues like that and if we make it so that um

948
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
the the players um uh so that the designers are happy then the players like this is just busy work

949
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
and it takes me forever and i have to salvage all these items you're making me make decisions and

950
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
there was like all sorts of things that like players were just not very happy about it just didn't feel

951
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
fun to actually use like i actually was never really happy with it in terms of just the user experience

952
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:12,000
um of using it so um we so we we we had built this whole thing and like we we balanced it a whole

953
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
bunch of different ways um and then we i think we were getting we were a bit too close to the issue

954
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
because the other thing that was happening through all of this was like you know like mark often was

955
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
like oh you know what if what if we just didn't have the crafting mix like can we just not have it

956
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
like the item system does work like there's all these complaints but you know like but maybe we just

957
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
don't need it and i know that rishi as well was kind of like yeah i don't i prefer he was like i prefer not

958
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
not to have it but then like if it works this way then i am okay with having it it's like

959
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
no no one was happy you know what i mean like like this is not a good thing um when you've got a

960
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:49,000
system like that um so eventually i think i yeah as i said it was saying i was a little bit too close

961
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
to the issue because i was like we can't launch into early access without a crafting bench because

962
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
the crafting bench is just a thing that players expect and like if we don't have a way for players to

963
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
feel like they've got a way to solve problems like resist or something like that um then people are

964
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
going to crucify us right like it's a really big issue and eventually and i don't remember who i

965
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
think it was rishi even who might have suggested this he basically just said hey so because that's

966
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
right because at one point i was like what if the crafting mix just added an extra mod so it didn't

967
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
affect the existing mods you just add an extra mod even if you already got the mod on the item

968
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
if it just adds an extra mod then it would solve the problems because um it doesn't like uh interfere

969
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
with the randomness of the other mods but it also lets you solve your problems so like there shouldn't

970
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
be any issue like sort of and that and that will kind of like yeah that'll solve the problem but we still

971
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:32,000
had the problem where people weren't really enjoying actually destroying and salvaging mods of items

972
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
like adding the extra like here's another thing to think about uh and the item system was just

973
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
something that people weren't just didn't it just wasn't fun so then rishi said okay well you're

974
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:47,000
talking about adding uh an extra mod to all items well we already have the socket system that we created

975
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
for um uh for ultimatum for the for the val orbs because at the time what they did is it could add one

976
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,000
socket but you didn't have existing sockets on items it was like what if we just allow exist sockets to spawn on items

977
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
we have a currency that lets you add sockets and we just also have just common runes that have just

978
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,000
like the standard mods um and this took basically no effort to implement because we already had the

979
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
stuff for sockets we already had like uh basically everything we needed and it pretty much exactly

980
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
was filling the function that the crafting bench was supposed to fill uh but yet it didn't have but

981
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
yet it feels fun because you don't have to have this busy work of having to salvage mods uh like you

982
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
know uh like salvage mods all the time um so effectively it just was just a way better solution

983
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
and as soon as we tried that it's like you know designers are happy players are happy everyone's

984
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,000
happy um so it was just immediately just uh just way better so um yeah but it does mean that we just

985
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
don't get that nice encyclopedia of mods that we had before um so i mean that that still exists right

986
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
like we could put that in a moment's notice we have the system but um what worth what i'm thinking is

987
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:48,000
is maybe we can find a way to get something of that nature in later on without it requiring um as much

988
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
busy work so one thing we discussed was like well what if we had this as an end game thing because like an

989
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
end game you wouldn't have uh as much of that tension problem of like because in order to make

990
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
the balance work for the amount of juice you need for a mod to work both at early game and at late

991
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
game the kind of balance you need to do is like kind of annoying with like massive exponential scaling

992
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
factors and like stuff like that um so uh you know that that was a one thing's like maybe it would

993
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
work if it was any game only system so i yeah i guess that's a bit of a ramble but effectively all

994
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
that is to say uh we've got the sitting in the wings we could theoretically bring it back the

995
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
problem is a design issue not a technical issue it's just like we were never happy with how it played

996
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,000
um and so yeah maybe one day we can make a way for it to work i appreciate you going into the

997
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
detail on it because it's actually it's really cool to hear the thought process behind it instead of

998
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
just hearing it's not going to be in the game like actually hearing the process of how you you came

999
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
to it i appreciate the answer going guys you're going to say some sorry um i i do think about like

1000
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
the whole idea with the crafting bench so we're not going to have a crafting bench it's being replaced

1001
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,000
by sockets featured uh i think it's it's pretty fair the way that approach is it seems to solve the

1002
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:57,000
situation but we also have the idea of micro transactions of bench bench uh micros that

1003
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:04,000
needs to be supported in pua2 what's stopping so i think so i think that for uh for now at least i

1004
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
believe that the salvage bench um obviously it's like way less of a big deal um but the salvage bench

1005
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
you can still have that in your hider you can still rethink that how you like and then if we do add

1006
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
the crafting bench back then you'll just be able to reskin that as well um there are also a couple of

1007
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
other things that are basically benches so effectively you'll be able to reskin those

1008
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
using crafting benches that you've already bought um as long as they're in the game then you have

1009
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
that so effectively that's what you get for now um i do that understand that it's like a little bit

1010
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
weird because um the uh you know the bench is not like the salvage bench is not as big of a deal as

1011
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
what the crafting bench was in poe1 so like uh the the you could argue that the reskin has less value

1012
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
in that sense but it's still a thing you can put in your hideout and still use in that way so

1013
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
you know we still have the compatibility there but think of it this way like it might be a

1014
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
a far-fetched idea where like think of the crafting bench of you putting your item in that

1015
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,000
you want to craft on and then implement the feature like rog pog crafting so you have a menu say hey i

1016
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
want to use the chaos orb you click on that one it will tell you this is what's going to happen to

1017
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
the item then you have to click craft now we have a proper use of the crafting bench it features some

1018
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
pwe1 to pwe2 i think people would like that with the idea of like showing the modifier that can apply

1019
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,000
to the item it's like one of the things pwe2 is so far is doing really good job at is preventing us from

1020
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
utilizing third-party tools and sites to the extent that it is and that could be a step in

1021
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,000
that direction again just spitball in here um but um i want to move on to another part of this question

1022
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
because otherwise we're going to sit here for another couple of hours um and it is about metacrafting

1023
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
we saw the omens uh allowing you to have the metacrafting approaches um so this question is from

1024
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
empyrean so shout out to him for this by the way um the question is can we use multiple metacrafts at

1025
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,000
once or multiple omens at once for a craft right i believe that you can't but i could be wrong about

1026
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:52,000
that but my understanding is it's one omen at a time um so uh yeah that uh does i think they would

1027
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
probably get too powerful if you're able to use more than one at once uh i guess you haven't seen

1028
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
the whole list yet but um effectively yeah uh one at a time is the is the main is the main idea with that

1029
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:08,000
all right well next yeah we're going to move over here to uh ascendancies and trials related

1030
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
question real quick so we saw the ascendancy we know how you do it you do it through the trials

1031
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
one of the things that we were trying to get some clarity on is do you get points uh from the trials

1032
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,000
based upon how you how far you progress in the trials or is it the type of situation where you're

1033
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
going to do multiple different trials to get the points i know there's like the coins associated with

1034
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
it so i was hoping we could you know hear how you go from you know your first two your second

1035
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
two etc in terms of points so effectively as you get higher level coins uh for example if you get

1036
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,000
coins in the case of sanctum so as you get high level coins um there's like certain level bracket

1037
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
break points where new floors open up so each floor uh in the case of sanctum there are there are

1038
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,000
four floors and then um those effectively if you complete floor one you get two points if you complete

1039
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
floor two you get your second two etc um but they only the extra floor only becomes available once you get a

1040
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
a coin of a higher of a high enough level and it says on the coin like how many floors um you're

1041
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,000
allowed to do uh based on that coin um so that means that you can't ascend a second time as soon as you

1042
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
as soon as you get there like you do have to get to a coin from a slightly higher level and the same

1043
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
is basically true of ultimatum as well so um effectively it'll say on the on the on the ultimatum

1044
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,000
how many uh how many rooms uh you're able to do uh and thus uh and basically for that one um it's the

1045
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
number of bosses uh that like you feel so after you've killed the first boss you get two points after you

1046
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
kill the second boss you get two and then the third boss you get another two and then the uh the final

1047
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
challenge at the end uh the fourth boss that uh have you that content if you're able to kill that

1048
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
one then you get your fourth set of points for that so effectively both in both cases um there are

1049
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:44,000
four bosses that you can kill um uh and effectively once you've defeated you know the second set of

1050
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
them uh then you get more points and so on and so forth now i think you alluded to this earlier but

1051
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:55,000
just to further clarify atlas progression can be done in a group as well as ascendancies can you

1052
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:01,000
do those in a group so when you go to do the the ultimatum etc you can yeah so everyone will be able

1053
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:08,000
to ascend everyone will be able to ascend if you go to a party um for the for the atlas um the uh the at

1054
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,000
the atlas state uh is only one like like it's one person's state um but uh obviously everyone's getting

1055
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,000
rewards and so on from that but um like but in terms of like actually like exploration um only

1056
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
one person is getting that exploration because they've all got separate atlases so effectively

1057
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
it has to be that way i'm assuming the atlas modifiers go off the person who like opens the

1058
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:34,000
point who's yeah yeah so effectively that yeah exactly exactly okay all right um yeah we'll move

1059
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
over to uh the next we're gonna go a little faster so we don't waste your time either or occupy too much

1060
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:46,000
of your time we're getting towards the end here yeah um so we saw a lot of skills being involved for

1061
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:52,000
specific weapons in the reveal we saw them open up an uncut skill gem as it was swords maces and flail

1062
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:59,000
um so the questions first is are there more new types or different types of weapons to come

1063
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and can we hear a bit about those we'll start with that yeah so effectively all of the um on that list

1064
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
it does have the full list of all the weapon types now i should mention that like the weapon types

1065
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
for classes that are sort of designed for classes that we're not releasing yet um we're not giving

1066
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:18,000
um the skills for those out either at the moment uh and that's just because um like effectively the

1067
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
weapon set of skills there is the class like and then if we so if we're doing that we'd also have

1068
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
to do all that other work as well um so effectively um there's there would be no point if we if we did

1069
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
that and um that does actually mean by the way that like swords are not dropping in poe 2 right now

1070
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
because there's no sword skills for them so there's no point uh in having them do that so effectively

1071
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
yeah like uh the one the ones that we've announced like those those set of ones that that's what

1072
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
you're getting at the moment and yeah as throughout early access we'll add some more but effectively

1073
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
that we do have that list on the side so you can see what they'll all be and um we'll talk more

1074
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
about like the specific play style of each of those weapons as we get through it but i one i will say

1075
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,000
one thing is that the the skills that you get on each weapon type i do want to make sure that if

1076
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:00,000
each weapon type feels very different from one another like i do would say that in uh poe 1 that like

1077
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
the difference between an axe and a sword is like not really that important um and i kind of want to make sure that like it

1078
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
feels like the skill set you get for each one is more distinct and um you know that they have and

1079
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
thus the play style is different so uh yeah we'll uh you obviously see more about that as we have the

1080
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
more classes fair enough but you said that there were all of them there and in the playtest that i've

1081
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
been part of we've seen both one scepters and staves but there were no skills related to those three

1082
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:32,000
is that something we're going to see in the future uh so the uh ones ones are kind of like you know

1083
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
part of the occult line and each wand has its own skill on it so there's actually a bunch of skills

1084
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
on those ones and um yeah as you play through the game uh effectively those will be part of your set

1085
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:46,000
of um of skills as well uh and then scepters um scepters have uh so there's actually two lines of

1086
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
scepters there's the ones that are more minion focused and those either give you minions or things

1087
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
that support minions and then there's the ones that are kind of designed to be more um

1088
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
uh well more for a different class uh so the there's there's another class as well that uses

1089
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
scepters commonly um i actually don't know whether or not any of those scepters are in the game currently

1090
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
but effectively there's like kind of a line of scepters that are designed they give you spirit

1091
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,000
um but they're more not so much about minions uh they're about something else so question mark

1092
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:20,000
yeah it's pretty obvious we're gonna get a pal but um pretty obvious but uh effectively um so you've

1093
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
got that as well so and then and then you've got the um the staves which also have their own set of

1094
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
things as well so effectively there's actually quite a lot of skills that are represented there

1095
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
um that um you don't see in those lists because they're kind of separate and actually one thing

1096
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
i should mention that maybe it wasn't obvious is that anytime something says it grants a skill

1097
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
that skill is supportable with support gems so like in the um uh in the in the presentation on if

1098
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
you saw in a sentencing class and that a sentencing class node says grant skill and then some skill

1099
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
you can support that skill with with sockets uh uh on your character so like that time stop for

1100
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
example like that's a supportable skill you can put things on that um and uh stuff like that so

1101
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
that's actually kind of one of those things that's yeah not not entirely obvious from just looking at

1102
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:02,000
it fair enough uh we'll move over to the next question which is with life not on the passive

1103
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:08,000
tree the shout out to kripparian for this one uh are some characters still uh going to potentially

1104
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,000
be significantly tankier than others as they are in pue one just to give some more context for the

1105
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
people watching we're talking about the difference between say a ci versus mind of a matter versus

1106
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:24,000
life stacking armor evasion etc yeah so i mean you can still absolutely get life you know from gear

1107
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
um but the main way that the tree is going to allow you to uh get uh uh to get tankier is

1108
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
effectively other effects like to do with defenses right so you know armor evasion and so on and

1109
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
there's quite a lot of stats around modifying those and doing different things with those i think

1110
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:43,000
there is a lot of scope for that kind of thing um and i think it's more obvious to a um a new player

1111
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
that if you want to be defensive then go for all this armor evasion or whatever nodes like um the whole

1112
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
breakdown of like some x percent needs to be life or whatever i think was confusing before

1113
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
um so effectively now um you know if you want defensive to be more defensive allocate those

1114
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
defensive nodes and you should be doing fine um we do want to make sure that you can feel a lot

1115
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
more defensive than some other characters for sure um and uh the uh yeah i mean i guess there's not a

1116
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
huge amount more to say about that effectively yeah just effectively yes we want to have the

1117
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:12,000
ability to control a lot of defensiveness uh from the tree i'm going to rapid fire a few uh

1118
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
questions related to warrior ascendancies here so one of them that got shown during the la

1119
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
presentation that went on i or actually open world games video and then has been kind of spread around

1120
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:27,000
right etc is the effectively the rucksack is back so you have the titan it says plus 20 inventory space

1121
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:32,000
there's been some questions related to quality of life being something that you get as an ascendancy

1122
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,000
point related to only a particular ascendancy so uh could you elaborate on the decision behind this

1123
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
um i guess there's not really a huge amount to say for a say about it like um mark mark was the

1124
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
one who was like yeah we should probably do this and you know like he uh he'd probably be a better

1125
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
one to answer that question but um he's he was kind of like you know what i think we'll try it out

1126
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
right if it doesn't work we'll just change it uh just true of anything we do so you know yeah i

1127
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
don't think there's some big deep philosophy around this it's just kind of like you know hey uh you know

1128
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,000
sure i yeah for context i think the reason people are asking is like well i want plus 20 on my class

1129
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:10,000
you know it's type of questions here well um so uh i do i'll interrupt you real quick there like

1130
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,000
there's that as well sure but there's also this idea that your first two ascendancy points like

1131
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
where your ascendancy points you get two of them you kind of want to get the majority of the classes

1132
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
giving you something that gives you power whereas this choice is only giving you a quality of life

1133
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:31,000
feature and blood mage first two ascendancies is a negative input for the class so i was curious

1134
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
about the decision making there ah right so okay well i'll give you i'll go into the blood mage one

1135
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
at least so one thing i should mention about that is that it does allow you to overcap your life by

1136
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
double which is something that i didn't mention in the video uh but it's kind of it's kind of

1137
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
important right so effectively if you're picking up those orbs uh then you can get to double the

1138
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:53,000
amount of life that you normally have so uh yeah i actually i actually pointed out yeah mark actually

1139
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:59,000
mentioned that i forgot to mention that upside in the uh in the uh the the the thing so uh yeah that's

1140
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:07,000
kind of an important element as well uh yeah okay all right yeah um that's actually funny yeah but i

1141
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:12,000
kind of look i i'm i i i know what you mean about the uh about about the one with the the inventory

1142
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,000
space uh keystone um sorry uh the ascendancy node so uh yeah i understood right like i totally get where

1143
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:24,000
you're coming from with that okay so i'm going to move on to the next uh ascendancy node so during the

1144
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
footage speaking of the footage of the presentation i'm sitting there and i'm super hyped about war i'm

1145
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
going to play a warrior i play warrior in all three tests i want it i want maces seeing the giant

1146
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:38,000
splits all looking good right so then they show the warrior class of the ancestral spirit and the

1147
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:43,000
footage shows a monkey who gets summoned he pounds his chest and he runs away to a tree he just runs

1148
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:49,000
away i know i know and this came up during like we saw that so late as well so okay one thing i think

1149
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
you guys should understand is the fact that like okay you probably assume that this video was ready

1150
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:00,000
like a week ago well let me tell you we were rendering it out the night before and still

1151
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
freaking working on it right so there are a lot of things about that video that i certainly would

1152
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
have wanted to improve the monkey running off into the tree was definitely on the list okay uh like

1153
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,000
that was that was in there um like uh yeah like that was that was certainly not not lost on us

1154
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
unfortunately we just didn't get time to uh uh to fix that um but yes i know you look good

1155
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
yeah i'm not so much trying to roast you about the monkey it's like everyone wants to know what

1156
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
the monkey do like there's a yeah yeah yeah what is it what does the monkey do can is there any chance

1157
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:34,000
i mean uh it's you know i don't actually have the finer details on this one um it's uh

1158
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
you know i actually i actually don't know i'm i i i would have to ask mark about that one he's the

1159
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:45,000
one working on that but uh yeah but the thing but but but it was not it was not lost on me though

1160
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:52,000
that one thing like it was yeah honestly like you know it's people yeah it it it it came on

1161
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:57,000
hot that presentation let me just let me just say that all right so it does more than runs away then

1162
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
yes yes it does more than runs away for sure it's going to be attacking it's going to be doing stuff

1163
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:08,000
it's just i think yeah just ai failed yeah it does something at some point yeah uh the the the jade

1164
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
would be the next portion we saw the jade is that defensive only there was a jade ramping stack and

1165
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
lets you gain jade per second so the question is are you gaining jade as you're in jade form

1166
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
sitting there and then that translates to a buffs of some kind or do you have to stack jade

1167
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
in order to be able to use the skill so i was hoping so while you're not using the skill

1168
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
effectively it's building up and that's effectively acting as a counter of the amount of damage that

1169
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
you can sustain i should mention by the way that um and i didn't do a good job of explaining this in

1170
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
the video that you can turn on and off like quickly like you've got an amount of jade and it's like

1171
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
you use it as when just when the boss slams then you can let go it doesn't just you don't just stay

1172
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
as a jade statue the video made it look like you just stay as a statue until it runs out but that's

1173
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
not how it works you just hold it down while and you're jade then you let go and you're not

1174
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
um so uh yeah like a cargo yeah yes well i mean you just hold down the skill right so effectively

1175
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
okay so you can use that to tank a bunch of damage and without and i think the design intention here

1176
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
really is that without dodge rolling you can stay where you are and tank like even an unblockable hit

1177
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
um uh like you know and then attack follow up immediately without having to like dodge away

1178
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,000
and like get out of position um so that's kind of the idea of that yeah so it's like a toggleable

1179
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
uh ball arctic armor kind of thing then well the thing is so i wouldn't i don't like the word

1180
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
toggleable to use here it is a skill you were using because like while you're holding it it's there

1181
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,000
and then when you're not holding it it's not there and also you can't do anything else while you're a

1182
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
jade statue right it's like it's like it's like it's like a skill that's turning you into a statue

1183
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,000
that's unmoving until you let go and then you can follow up again so um yeah it's kind of like

1184
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
as i said you should think of it more like a dodge roll where you don't have to actually move like

1185
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
it's a way of defending yourself against a big attack that um you would otherwise uh get away from

1186
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,000
all right well that makes it sound a lot better um so uh another question people are going i'm going to

1187
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,000
try and make this a little bit faster here uh party play there was the chronomancer looked awesome

1188
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
was the one that caught me the off guard the most how does the freezing time work in party play

1189
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:05,000
it doesn't it doesn't stop your friends yeah yeah yeah it only stops the monsters so uh you know

1190
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
so you can overlap these like have someone go and then the next guy go and then the next guy go

1191
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:16,000
theoretically i don't see why not uh that would work um you know yeah there you go um i'm gonna tell

1192
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
you i'm gonna cut in here with uh two more quick ones and then we're gonna let gazi had some minion

1193
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
questions after that we're just at the like the q a rapid fire the last few like couple from chat

1194
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:31,000
here and then we're pretty much going to send you on your way um so uh div cards have been in the

1195
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
game i believe this was confirmed from the puzzle boxes that were originally that was the first

1196
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:41,000
basically mention of this um so we're hoping to hear a little bit of information about how you want

1197
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:47,000
div cards to be you know presented within uh you know this as well as maybe some timelines because i

1198
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
saw on the packs you guys are both selling this as well as unique items will come up as support

1199
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,000
your packs as well so some information related to all of those yeah so effectively um once we've got

1200
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
the um uh our ducks in a row to be able to sell that because you know like we were a little bit

1201
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
worried we were just kind of feeling we were planning on selling at the same time as the um

1202
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,000
uh as the supporter packs came out um but uh you know we just run we ran out of time a little bit so

1203
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
we couldn't quite put them up and we were a bit worried because um uh there's a the way the system

1204
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
works with these limited sale items uh you've got to make sure there's fairness issues around it so

1205
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
we're kind of thinking like we should probably make sure we've got a time that we're going to

1206
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
sell and we have some system for like allowing people to like fair access to them because we're

1207
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
not going to sell too many of them because every single one of them requires an artist draws like

1208
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
an image you know based on a description that the player supplies so this is going to be a limited

1209
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
thing there won't be too many of them sold um and then the same is true of the um of the uniques as

1210
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
well now these are going to be expensive right because the thing is is that we can't sell that many of

1211
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
them and the cost to deliver a unique item now is like so much higher than it was back when it was just

1212
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
some art and a few stats like there's a lot going on with these so uh you know we're going to be

1213
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
doing that um i understand that you got you got one randomly in a in a box is that right dm i did i

1214
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
was i was curious for myself i wasn't going to take your time asking but since you're bringing it up

1215
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,000
i where the boxes sent out did you guys hand pick like you get this one you just put them in a hat

1216
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:11,000
so um there was a 10 chance uh to get a uh a creator unique uh and a 90 chance to get a div card so you

1217
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:19,000
lucked out uh pretty oh my god um so uh yeah so hopefully people don't feel insulted if they

1218
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
didn't get one of those because it really was random like i've got no idea who they got sent to

1219
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
um but uh anyway uh what was it oh that's right so the div cards yes so the div cards designed like

1220
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
you know they've actually got like a new a bit of a new design as well a fresh coat of paint but

1221
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
they do fundamentally work uh the same way that they worked before the nice thing is is that because

1222
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
of the way the atlas works now it's much more reasonable for us to make uh the drop rates uh like

1223
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
you know like like you're not going to be able to since you won't be able to

1224
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,000
just grind a single map again and again and again we can kind of make it like the better

1225
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
in terms of like how often they drop when you find a given map and things like that

1226
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
and uh just like you know it's just nicer for us to be able to spread them around the atlas like this

1227
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,000
so i think that that'll make the div card experience um quite a lot cooler um and uh yeah i think

1228
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
hopefully it's just a fun time right like just like a you know like we like doing this community

1229
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
stuff um you know like it's just fun to have the players involved and things like that so uh you know

1230
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
that'll be fun and of course the uniques are another whole can of worms uh uh where uh you know there's

1231
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
there's always a there's always a lot of back and forth with the community members about like you

1232
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
know how op it can be and all that sort of stuff like that like it's definitely always a thing

1233
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
so it'll be interesting to see how well you can work with uh our designers on that one

1234
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
i'm still waiting for my box is stuck in customs or something even though i paid for it

1235
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
sorry about that yeah yeah sorry about that it's not your fault it's sweden's postal service is

1236
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:40,000
horrible it's terrible yeah yeah so at this point pretty much i think we cut gassy loose to ask his

1237
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
minion related questions i think he had a little list of these here a little list i try to keep it

1238
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:51,000
short i hope everybody's comfortable um so let's just dive right into it if we label this as the gassy

1239
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:58,000
minion rant uh it is short though mind you uh we can start with the footage we watched earlier uh from

1240
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,000
uh conflict creators had the demon form from the infernalist when you popped it all the

1241
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
minions disappeared in the footage in the reveal you had minions uh we need some elaboration on this

1242
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,000
so this is actually something that i think probably does need some addressing um because uh right now

1243
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,000
since the demon form is a uh is a shapeshift form it means that your weapons are no longer equipped

1244
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
because you don't have your scepter um and i need to talk to mark about the balance of that because i

1245
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
think that's probably not correct um this is just one of those things that um like needs probably

1246
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
some specific stuff so i'll talk to him about that and we'll make sure that um we sort something out

1247
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
because that uh demon form is obviously intended to be used with minions it has like a like like

1248
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
it's got specific stuff so you know like i'll talk to him and we'll see we'll see about that

1249
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
um so uh yeah that that was happening there for sure all right um but yeah as i said i think it needs

1250
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:51,000
to be addressed um the next question is i i know you love this a lot of people don't but i know you love

1251
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:59,000
it and it is the animate guardian will we see it will it work differently uh not an ea but uh we'll

1252
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:05,000
we'll see we'll see about that oh actually oh no no okay there is something uh there no you know what

1253
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
it's not an ea so i won't talk about it but there is a there is there are some other things that kind

1254
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,000
of take some of the design space of that that um that uh you'll see later on uh but uh there are

1255
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
some there are some stuff uh i just think that it didn't quite make it uh i'm pretty sure it hasn't

1256
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:24,000
made it yet so we won't have it okay um so we obviously have the spirits being the reservations

1257
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:30,000
resource for both minions and auras so could you elaborate on the uh power balance approach that

1258
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,000
you have the mindset for minion players when it comes to reserving your spirits like how are we

1259
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,000
supposed to incorporate auras or is it just meant for us to just not have any auras they're supposed

1260
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
to be for minions so a couple of things i'll say one of them is is that on some level you do have to

1261
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:50,000
make some decisions about you know like do i want more or do i want more minion my hope is is that

1262
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
there'll be some tension there where like in some cases it'll be more of one some cases more of the

1263
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,000
other um however i will mention that um you effectively have an aura on a on a on a stick

1264
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
um with the scepter because the scepters have a bunch of traditional aura mods um so effectively um

1265
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:08,000
you you you that's what the expectation is usually that if you're playing a pure minion build and

1266
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
you're not wanting to actually hit with your hit yourself and then you'll probably want to go all

1267
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,000
all all in with all of the sort of aura mods on the scepter um and that will allow you to kind of

1268
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
get that kind of gameplay there uh as well so that would be the intention there yeah speaking of

1269
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,000
scepters uh i know we talked about this in la a few times actually and that's regarding weapon swapping

1270
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,000
uh when you have a scepter in one hand and now your weapon is helping to a non-scepter set so the

1271
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,000
intention the intention is to have it so that you can lock uh one of the weapons to work on both sets so if

1272
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:42,000
you've got one scepter that is uh like really good uh then you don't have then you can effectively

1273
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
lock that in place so that you no matter what you're swapping your other hand to um you can uh

1274
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
keep that like you can make sure that you've still got your scepter but i believe that that feature

1275
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
isn't quite in yet and i don't know if it'll make it for early access or not it might do or it might

1276
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:00,000
not depending on whether we get time to do it follow-up question follow-up question on that is

1277
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,000
let's say you have a scepter like that gives you x amount of more skeleton warriors and you're weapon

1278
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:10,000
swapping to without scepters now obviously the worst goes away but if the scepter gives you spirit

1279
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
that you have reserved for minions in what order what minions will be then disappear when you're

1280
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:20,000
then switching to a set that gives you less spirit than you're reserving um good question

1281
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
now what okay so

1282
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
now the answer to this is tricky okay because there's okay so there is a there is an odd

1283
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:37,000
there is another user interface that isn't going to make it for early access all right that will uh

1284
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:43,000
much more clearly let you configure this because that interface has a separate column for each

1285
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:50,000
weapons that you have and you can put up and down the minion counts per weapon set in one grid um

1286
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:57,000
because uh so so that actually allows you to really exactly dial in this exact stuff um but unfortunately

1287
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
we didn't get time and like so there are a couple of problems with regard to spirit and minions and

1288
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
that interface that we have right now that are like make it a bit more confusing and so we actually i

1289
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
like i we literally have like prototypes of this but we just didn't quite finish it for ea but

1290
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
effectively you can control what minions are going to be spawned on what weapons independently and you

1291
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
don't necessarily have to have it's not necessarily the case that like certain ones die

1292
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
because you ran out of spirit it can be that you just have a completely different setup of how you

1293
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
want your minions to be um on the other weapon set if you want and then that some will some will die

1294
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
and others will summon based on that so you can use weapon sets to effectively have two completely

1295
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
different layouts of how you want your minions to be uh if you want uh that that is a possibility

1296
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,000
that you have because effectively the reservations you have for weapons are per weapon set um and can

1297
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,000
be completely configured to whatever ones now any counts that are like you know if you've got a count

1298
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
on one that's like three and a count on one that's six then yeah it'll like change the three will

1299
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
die in order to account for the for the other three but effectively you can do kind of any kind of

1300
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
layout you want actually between the different sets so the way that you'll see that is if you change

1301
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
weapon sets right now then effectively the numbers will change and the thing and if you adjust them

1302
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:02,000
then it will effectively unlock the two between the two sets that's kind of the confusing part i

1303
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
think at the moment because it's not obvious that that's occurring and that's the reason why we

1304
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
wanted to have that grid layout of having like here's one set a here's weapons at b here's the

1305
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
counts you have in each one um so to make that very explicit so you can see what's going on there

1306
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
and it's the same with auras as well where you can have like auras enabled and disabled on certain

1307
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
weapon sets but it's like not very obvious with the user interface that we have at the moment that that's going on

1308
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,000
okay okay um it seems like you have that seems like the solution to have one set for single

1309
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
target fights and one for clearing essentially yeah you can do things like that if you want

1310
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
what were you saying i'm sorry oh i got a question uh just because you're talking about weapons

1311
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
weapon swapping here so dual wielding the thing that i thought looked interesting is dual wielding

1312
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:42,000
two-handers obviously look pretty cool um so i'm kind of curious is is the benefit of dual wielding

1313
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,000
two-handers like is it the same as poe one or how exactly does the benefit of of dual wielding

1314
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
two-handers scale in poe two yeah so effectively it's actually different per skill um so every

1315
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:57,000
skill has got its own decision about how uh dual wielding works with it um in some cases that will

1316
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
be visual in the sense that you can just see the fact that you hit with both weapons like in the

1317
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:06,000
animation right so like they're just now what we're generally trying to do is make sure that each attack

1318
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,000
just like both weapons are inside it um and the animations might be such that like like the idea is to

1319
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
try and sort of balance that with like what what the animation is effectively doing

1320
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
um but i usually you'll hit with both weapons in a single attack but there are some attacks where you

1321
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,000
alternate and then you are faster and there are some attacks that hit with both at the same time

1322
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
and it merges the damage packages so that you get like all of your stuff in one like it actually is

1323
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
just very skill dependent um so uh yeah they you'll have to sort of play around a bit to do that but um

1324
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:38,000
one thing you might have noticed is that um on skill gems now and this is also true in the skill in the

1325
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,000
in the advanced skill uh screen um there's different tabs where you can see uh the different like you know

1326
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
like you'll have like weapon a and weapon b and different tabs and things like that i believe

1327
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
that's how it works anyway um so that means you can kind of see like how that how that all interacts

1328
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:57,000
and um yeah but effectively yeah different answer per skill all right okay uh i'm gonna move on with uh

1329
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:02,000
with my minion rant and say uh i'm just gonna say one word and a question mark and the word is golems

1330
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:10,000
uh not right now but uh i am sure we'll come we'll come to those in the future all right um

1331
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:16,000
um we'll uh we'll wrap it up uh with a couple quick ones from the minions shout out to creep for

1332
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
this one and that is the first question here is permanent minions have commonly had lower power

1333
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,000
scaling than that of temporary minions in poe 1 and the question is will this theme still be a thing

1334
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:32,000
in poe 2 despite the lack of generating corpses versus bosses so effectively the temporary minions

1335
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,000
are designed in such a way that they can make a boss fight make sense in terms of damage and everything

1336
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
that you can do and the temporary minions are kind of designed in a way to make it so that when you've

1337
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:46,000
got uh your permanent ones plus also your temporary ones then that makes sense for clearing so um this

1338
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:52,000
is kind of a way to have like a different situation for um uh for for bosses versus non-bosses now there

1339
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
are certainly cases where you've got bosses that have minions and then those ones you can raise

1340
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
temporary minions and that effectively means that a minion build will have an easier time with those

1341
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
fights just because like of that you know just because of that um but that's kind of okay like uh many many

1342
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
fights don't have many uh don't have uh boss is not spawning minions so like it's kind of not like a big

1343
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
deal and also it's just fine sometimes to just have some fights for some builds are better than others

1344
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
and that's okay um so effectively yeah the intention is is that with just the permanent

1345
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:20,000
minions that you have um you should be uh uh well with a couple of exceptions there's a few ways to

1346
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
do a few things but effectively with just the permanent minions you have that should make boss

1347
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
combat feel correct and it's also kind of important as well because um when you've got a full suite of

1348
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:33,000
temporary minions the amount of minions you can have is like absolutely outrageous and for clearing that's fine but for

1349
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
making boss combat actually makes sense um having the fewer number by just having only the permanent

1350
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
ones kind of makes means that like you actually get the like proper combat we're trying to have

1351
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
uh for boss fights so um yeah i think that that actually does quite work in that way having having

1352
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
the combination of the two it's funny that you mentioned because that's how it felt playing at even

1353
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:55,000
low level like you had an army it was beautiful yeah yeah uh i will uh ask one last question which is

1354
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,000
actually the most important one we saw blood mage we saw infernalist which seems to be like the fire

1355
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:07,000
oriented minion ascendancy but where's my necromancer like is the third ascendancy gonna be like

1356
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:13,000
occult chaos dot curse and minions or what are we expecting to see here i won't say exactly what it

1357
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
is but what i will say is this one challenge we have with the ascendancies is we don't want it to be

1358
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
that if you're playing a minion character here's the one ascendancy right like we don't want it to

1359
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:26,000
be that this is always your choice so this makes it very tricky to design because we need to make

1360
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
sure that there's like something and a variety of these that you'd actually be interested in and um

1361
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,000
so that being said look i think like it's a cool fantasy that we want to have the sort of necromancer

1362
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
type thing but i think that in order to do it we have to make it so it's not just so obviously what

1363
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,000
you need to pick um that uh that's the only choice and effectively so this is the design problem we have

1364
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
so i think that effectively um there's just was a shelving of like we're having trouble solving this

1365
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,000
problem we'll just go with these two for now um and uh that's kind of like the the the the the main

1366
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
issue so yeah that's the thing of the design constraint we're working around with this okay

1367
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,000
so now we are uh we made it through all our main questions we have a handful of just like you don't

1368
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,000
have to elaborate much just real simple ones that we pulled from the chat right before the the start

1369
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
and then you know thank you we went a little we went about a half hour longer than we were planning

1370
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
to hold you but we appreciate you taking the time um so i'll shoot these i'll shoot these last ones

1371
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:21,000
out from the chat here um okay first one strong boxes uh that were shown in the review seem like you

1372
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
kind of get locked in almost like rich you want to take a really long time for them to come out

1373
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:31,000
this is this is another one of those um i wish we could have replaced that shot um uh things because

1374
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
like afterwards we're like god damn it like we sped up the freaking spawn rate on that strongbox like

1375
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
right before we recorded that uh like sorry right after we recorded that and we didn't get a chance to

1376
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,000
reshoot it so yes the the number of monsters that spawn from that is much much faster normally uh it's

1377
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:49,000
just that that uh the number was incorrect in that video so uh you should expect the strongboxes just to be

1378
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
better than that i believe that the smoke thing i i think the smoke thing was just a mod on it

1379
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
wasn't it um i think it could have been i i think it was the minion pace it was like every time i saw

1380
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:05,000
that when i was watching like uh people react and stuff i was like god damn it i really had a chance

1381
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:15,000
to reshoot that shot like the monkey yeah yeah yeah all right uh so next one here uh mouse plus analog

1382
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
concurrently like if you have an analog stick plus a mouse can you use them both at the same time this

1383
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:25,000
was somebody asking about an accessibility question we plan to have it so that you can uh swap like so

1384
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:33,000
the ui will swap dynamically between um the console version and the um uh and the the the the keyboard

1385
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
version um like when you just use each controller but right now it doesn't do that um but that's a

1386
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
feature that's been really requested so um we're gonna we're gonna get to it we just need to get to it

1387
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
after the start of ea um but maybe you weren't asking that exactly were you asking about um analog

1388
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:51,000
controller i think they're asking but like like i'm not quite sure to be honest with you really that

1389
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
the the accessibility but the question in particular uh it says they wanted to use the mouse and an

1390
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:02,000
analog stick at the same time and i'm not sure how that would work because i'm not familiar that is not

1391
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
something that we currently support um as i said the thing we will support is just the ability to swap

1392
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
from mouse keyboard uh uh ui to control ui and the main reason for that by the way so because people

1393
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:16,000
are keen to be able to manage their inventory using mouse keyboard um but uh actually play using

1394
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
controller and um so that's something that we're keen to support once we um you know once we get

1395
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,000
around to doing that we shouldn't be too far into early access on that topic we had another rapid fire

1396
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:31,000
question that is mouse and keyboard support for consoles yes or no uh not currently there um i believe

1397
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,000
uh it's something that we hadn't really considered until someone asked it very recently um i suppose it

1398
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
could be done i would have to check in with the console team but um yeah i don't believe it's there

1399
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,000
currently all right another really big question which we're going to condense to a rapid fire version

1400
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:50,000
and that is we saw ignite magnitude could you just in a short term explain what magnitude

1401
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,000
just a multiplayer on ignite so effectively ignite i believe by default is like 25 of the hit it does

1402
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:01,000
that uh oh geez how exactly is the math well anyway the bigger the hit the more ignite the you

1403
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
damage you get and then magnitude effectively allows you to scale the ignite just a multiplayer

1404
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:11,000
and this is like with boys as well it is the it determines the dot exactly exactly and then you

1405
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,000
exactly uh we had a few questions related to uh separate clients and be able to play both games at

1406
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
the same time so let's say people will be able to want to play poe one and poe two at the same time

1407
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,000
i'm assuming trading or something like that you know um they will be you can do that um it's actually a

1408
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:34,000
a bit weird um there might be um uh like a few slight slight oddities when you do that with regard

1409
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:39,000
to when you change microtransactions and stuff um but it does work um it's something you can do

1410
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:47,000
okay uh ultra wide resolution for instance i have a 49 inch monitor ultra wide resolution poe two how's

1411
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:52,000
that looking um so you can do up to so hang on how big are the what's the ratio of those big ones i believe

1412
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:58,000
that the biggest widest monitor usually is like 29 by six it's a weird yeah it's weird whatever that

1413
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
number is that's the big ultra wide so we do allow you to go up to that if you go wider than that it'll

1414
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:09,000
start to add black bars um i will say though that like um like qa are not routinely running around

1415
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
with one of these um so there can be cases where you get like pop it like maybe a few cases it should

1416
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:18,000
generally work but you just might get a few visual things just like like i've noticed cases for example

1417
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
where it's like the the level is not quite big enough so if you stand in one corner you might see off the edge

1418
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
of the level very slightly like in a few cases like there's a few kind of like weird things around but

1419
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
in general it works fine you know it's just that it's kind of not something that we've been like

1420
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:35,000
going out of our way to fix little art issues and when there are issues sure as genre defining

1421
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:41,000
things like minion summoners have been for the for the a rpg world so is cyclone spin to win are we

1422
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:47,000
going to see something like a spin to win skill in poe 2 soon you will eventually just unfortunately

1423
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,000
the exact cyclone skill of just hold it down forever and just spin forever we don't have in this

1424
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
version it is on another class um that will have that um there's are quite a few other skills that

1425
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
involve swirling around and doing stuff though so um you know it's not like you're not going to have

1426
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
things similar things like that monk skill which is a little bit different with the the twirling of

1427
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,000
the staff it's sort of similar but um yeah the true just like hold down forever and just channel

1428
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:12,000
spinning um that's on a different class that isn't in the air okay um on another topic referring to

1429
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:20,000
peewee one is a spell totem will we see a spell totem in peewee two um you will see it um do we have it in

1430
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:29,000
ea or not i thought we did did we have it in ea or not well look you're certainly going to have it

1431
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:34,000
the question is will you have it soon um i actually sorry i'm actually not sure i mean look it was on

1432
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,000
the skill list recently is it still on the skill list well if you're asking you probably isn't right

1433
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,000
so it's possible that it was removed from the um from from the sork skill list if um if you didn't see

1434
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
it uh but so it might have been cut temporarily but look it's it's it's been made it's there it's just

1435
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
like there must have been some issue with it if it's not there so yeah right here uh how about

1436
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:59,000
modifiers for maps that uh like brick the map for instance you know reflect being notable elemental

1437
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
immunities things like that concepts for this for peewee too um so we do definitely have modifiers

1438
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
that are hard and look some modifiers will definitely be something that will be hard on your build i know

1439
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
we i don't think we've got reflect um but uh you know there are there are just there are mods that are

1440
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
hard um so it can you know it can happen right there are things like you've got to you've got to have

1441
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:21,000
certain things that you could be a build can be good or bad against i believe um it's notable

1442
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,000
though that um the upsides and downsides work a bit differently um because because the uh

1443
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
upsides are prefixes and the downsides are suffixes rather than having them merged together

1444
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
um so that means the number of downsides that you face uh it will be lower because there's only going

1445
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
to be three rather than six and that means that each one is like a bit more sort of interesting in

1446
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
my opinion as far as like you know like you've got the issue with mod dilution where it's like if you've got

1447
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,000
six things affecting you then you barely even notice them because well it's not you don't notice them but it's like

1448
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:49,000
each one is not like as important uh because you know because there's six of them um whereas when

1449
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
there's three it's like the three downsides actually matter quite a lot so um yeah i think it sort of

1450
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,000
changes the gameplay around that quite a bit um but uh yeah sure there might be cases where mods can

1451
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:03,000
can kind of break your build but not try to avoid those if you can um i personally think it's interesting

1452
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
to be able to play around certain stuff like that sometimes but yeah we don't want to be as harsh as

1453
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:13,000
something like reflectors i would say sure um one question that came up a few times was related to

1454
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:19,000
like an import export for instance for skill trees so for people can effectively copy paste builds in

1455
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:24,000
there it's just a philosophy you guys are for against etc um so they're actually there's a feature that

1456
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
we never actually finished for this um it's in the game client but i think probably disabled right now

1457
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
um so it's something that we did plan on doing it's just that the ui for it was kind of crap and we

1458
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,000
didn't get time to finish it um but effectively there was going to be a thing where you could make a dot

1459
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
build file which would effectively be like a skill tree layout um that you could import

1460
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
and effectively work kind of like an item filter we could throw it in a folder and then the client

1461
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
will pick it up and then you can select with a drop down which of the builds you want and it just

1462
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,000
shows you the layout and you can just allocate this point so we are planning on doing that we just kind

1463
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:57,000
of haven't uh haven't got around to finishing it yet so uh yeah we'll get to it we'll get guide

1464
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:05,000
writers rejoice across the globe um from now till the early access launch 6th of december we're not that

1465
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:11,000
many days off 12 days if my math is right teasers from now till then can we expect yep so

1466
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,000
there's definitely going to be teasers the community team have got a bunch of things

1467
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,000
or at least they'll be making them um yep it is scary being so close like uh the big concern that

1468
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:24,000
i have um is obviously server stuff now like my big concern is like can we make sure that the servers

1469
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:32,000
are going to hold up um there's a lot of interest um just looking um at the you know the the numbers

1470
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
i'm seeing from like supporter pack sales and so on like i think there's going to be a lot of people on

1471
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:41,000
day one um so uh my job now is going to be like making sure that that's going to be okay um i

1472
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
really really hope we can do that because it's going to really suck if we get like launch day

1473
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,000
problems um but uh yeah i'm worried we're going to be setting record numbers that will you know be

1474
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:55,000
very hard to deal with but uh you know we'll do our best obviously um yeah that's we just i just that

1475
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:00,000
that's that's going to be my thing to concentrate on going forward fair enough i want to just real quick

1476
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:06,000
follow up on that was because it sounds to me like you're almost surprised by the amount i mean

1477
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
obviously you know you have a good product you've been making a good product for a while so you're

1478
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:15,000
not surprised you have a good product but what i'm hearing is uh there's a lot of interest maybe

1479
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
even more so than you were would you say this is accelerating a little bit larger than you guys

1480
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:26,000
originally anticipated or how you know how that's got to be encouraging right it is the thing is is that um

1481
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:34,000
i guess so obviously when we get to um uh to to open you know full release right obviously the

1482
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
numbers there are going to be ridiculous because it's free you know anyone can play it i guess the

1483
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
expectation was that because this was paid entry and also like there's just a general feeling around

1484
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
early access that people have where it's like oh maybe i'll just wait till the release you know like

1485
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
there's always this kind of feeling of like uh you know i'm gonna i'm gonna wait and i guess my

1486
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,000
feeling was that because of the fact we had both that and also the um uh yeah and also the fact that

1487
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:58,000
it wasn't you know like you can't get in necessarily for free i guess i was thinking like

1488
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,000
we would probably see sort of similar numbers to what we've seen in previous poe um launches but um

1489
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
uh yeah i mean just the number of people buying packs and so on i mean it's looking like it's

1490
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
going to be pretty damn huge and i mean look obviously that was my goal right i wanted it to

1491
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
be large and the the the part of the whole thing of having so much content in early access is literally

1492
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:20,000
to get this result right so on some level i can't be too surprised um but at the same time

1493
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
you know there's always those factors of like you know like like i was i was completely certain we

1494
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,000
were going to smash it out of the park with regard to the full release i just wasn't certain as certain

1495
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:34,000
that we were going to um have uh records on um concurrent records for concurrency on um on early

1496
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:39,000
access and so it's looking like we will um and uh you know that means we have to make sure that our

1497
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:44,000
servers are up to the jobs uh and it's not really a question of like buy more servers i mean we can always

1498
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
do that um although even that at some level of scale becomes tricky um because you know like you

1499
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
you can't just turn up to amazon and be like hey we need like you know 5 000 servers out of nowhere

1500
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:58,000
like you know they're like there actually is some level of like you know of doing that so we're doing

1501
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,000
that you know you're getting that all organized but it's also just like the back end right can the

1502
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:08,000
back end handle it um you know we we have to write you know load testing stuff to kind of make sure

1503
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:12,000
that we can like you know try to simulate it but then you know your simulations will never quite

1504
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
match reality you never quite know uh you know will it actually work so um you know we're doing

1505
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
our best basically to try and make sure that's the case but um uh yeah i think we could see a pretty

1506
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
significant amount of people uh turning up early access looking like it's going to be very popular

1507
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:30,000
can't wait uh last rapid fire question we have right now is equip gear even though the gear piece

1508
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:36,000
itself makes you fulfill the attribute requirements there's actually one more question but you know what

1509
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
i'm talking about let's say you have a pair of gloves they have 20 decks and if you're unequipped

1510
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
you can't equip the skill gem or whatever can you switch that with another pair of glove with

1511
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:50,000
dexterity without that being a problem uh you can switch uh you can swap them uh when you already

1512
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
meet the requirements on both you can swap them between and that will not break anything

1513
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
but currently if you have a piece of gear that will support itself like if you have a piece of gear

1514
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
where equipping it would give you enough stats to support it unfortunately it doesn't currently let

1515
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
you do that you have to find a way to get the decks first and that is annoying um and we are

1516
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
planning on fixing it one day uh we just haven't gotten around to it it's just one it's just very tricky to

1517
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,000
implement uh it seems like it's simple but the problem is that to actually do it completely

1518
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:20,000
correctly because there are stats that um affect uh like that i'm trying to think of one out of the

1519
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:24,000
top of my head but it's like if you have a stat for example that says something like this that it

1520
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:30,000
doubles your decks then immediately it's not just a question of like you know adding one and you

1521
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
actually have to work like you have to effectively work out like okay what would the stats be on my

1522
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
character if i were to equip this thing including all the changes that would occur from all the

1523
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
different mods on this thing and then after you've done that then it's like now i've done

1524
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:44,000
none that a fake simulation of that now i need to do that for real and so uh it's like uh it's just

1525
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
a little bit tricky to actually organize doing that so we will get to it one day because it's a feature

1526
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,000
that i'd love to have but um yeah currently it doesn't it doesn't work all right so the last

1527
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:58,000
rapid fire question we have and i'll send you on out is people were asking many times about dlss support

1528
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,000
ah yeah we have that nice there you go the answer to that question one thing i will say about it

1529
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
though just one detail is that um uh the just to get a little bit technical here because you know

1530
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,000
i used to kind of do engine programming stuff the motion vectors we have um i don't think

1531
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:16,000
are as high quality as some games have and we're using one of the dlss profiles that's kind of

1532
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:20,000
supposed to be okay with that it just means that some of the motion reconstruction may not be as good

1533
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,000
as like you get in some games i think it's pretty reasonable but honestly i'm not a huge fan of dlss

1534
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:31,000
myself anyway like i um prefer um the the the the the un the the you know the raw frames i'm just

1535
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
that kind of guy i guess um but yeah we have support for it and it works well like it's certainly the

1536
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
performance improvement you're hoping for it's just that um the motion vectors for some things like

1537
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:43,000
because i mean we're really spell heavy right and so spells are like like all those alpha transparent

1538
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:48,000
effects that's like the worst thing for like upscaling um they're like they that's where you have

1539
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,000
all the kind of issues so um that's kind of where you'd expect to see the kind of artifact that you get

1540
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:59,000
from dlss all right well uh that's it we won't take any more of your time uh we'll just take those

1541
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,000
questions and go thanks for going you know twice the length really that we expected to be here two

1542
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:08,000
hours i've got a lot of good information is there anything you want to throw out at the end just

1543
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,000
because we're about to wrap is anything you want to say ask or yeah i don't know really i think we

1544
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
probably covered everything but you know i just honestly i just really hope everyone enjoys the game

1545
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:20,000
when we release soon um you know i'm just that's i'm just i'm just really keen and as i said i i'm sorry if

1546
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,000
the servers fall over like i'm really like i really really hope we're able to get the service to not

1547
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:31,000
fall over on release day that's just my my one goal now so you know yeah yeah uh we'll do our best
