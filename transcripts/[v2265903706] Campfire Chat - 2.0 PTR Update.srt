00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

684
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

685
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

686
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

687
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

688
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

689
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

690
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
5...

691
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Soicable

692
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:18,000
64-40 Under the water hose.

693
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Power Energy.

694
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,000
villair.

695
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

696
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

697
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm going to go to the next room.

698
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and searches for a way to banish him back to the abyss.

699
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
As we wrap up Diablo IV, there has been a huge battle

700
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
in how between Anarius, the Cathedral of Lights, and Lilith,

701
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and all of her demons.

702
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Throughout this entire campaign in Diablo IV,

703
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
you're basically trying to defeat Lilith,

704
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
so you team up with people like Nehraal,

705
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
who's this young, eager character.

706
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And then you've got Laura, who is this sort of wise drunk.

707
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
He was a heraldrum, so he brings this rounded old school

708
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
thinking he ends up being the catalyst of the group.

709
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
In Anarius believed that if he killed Lilith,

710
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
he would be accepted again by Heaven.

711
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So he went after Lilith, he actually stabbed her,

712
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and Heaven did not take him back.

713
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And he had this moment of, I've been wrong this entire time,

714
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and she used that against him and ended up killing an enemy.

715
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And then, she ended up killing Anarius.

716
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Her goal was to devour her father, Mifisto,

717
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and we ended up actually stopping her.

718
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And so even though she was defeated,

719
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
she kind of gave us a warning of,

720
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I was the only one that could actually save you from Mifisto.

721
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Nehraal is left with the Soul Stone,

722
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
and she decides to take the essence of Mifisto

723
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and trap him into the Soul Stone.

724
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Laura is still with us, and he's going to try

725
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and help us find information on where Nehraal went.

726
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And so we leave off with her,

727
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
sailing south with the stone, telling you,

728
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
do not follow. The world might need you.

729
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And over time, things start to unfold,

730
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and you realize that Nehraal cannot do this alone.

731
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And so you start your search for her.

732
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
When we pick up Investal of hatred,

733
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
the cathedral light is kind of in disarray.

734
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It became a bit fractured, with the death of Anarius.

735
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
There was a bit of a split with the cathedral light afterwards.

736
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
This created an opening for a whole new sect to rise up

737
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
and take things into their own hands.

738
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And so you end up with a militant wing of the church

739
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
that is the burnt knights.

740
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Burn knights are led by your vars, a survivor of hell.

741
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
He's uncompromising.

742
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
He feels that he's final judgment

743
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and that he's going to make better decisions for the church.

744
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
They battled in hell, and now they're on this manhunt

745
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
for Nehraal and for Lauraal.

746
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
They want them to pay for their crimes.

747
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And they think that they should be the ones

748
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that have a say in what happens to Sanctuary.

749
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The Fistos is the Lord of hatred.

750
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He's probably the one primeval that can create

751
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
the most deep rooted chaos breaking up the people of Sanctuary.

752
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
In the events of Diablo II, he was destroyed.

753
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
He's been slowly resurrecting himself in hell.

754
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And he wants to come back and bring himself back to Sanctuary.

755
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
He is in this soul stone that Nehraal carries.

756
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
This is his opportunity.

757
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The herald of hatred is Mephisto's wolf form.

758
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's this astral projected form that he gets to put out

759
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and connect with the player and whisper in people's ears.

760
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The connection between Nehraal, the player, and Mephisto

761
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
is the fate of the world.

762
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Nehraal wants to get rid of them.

763
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But the more time she spends with the stone,

764
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
the tighter the bond between her and the stone is.

765
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
The corrupting influence of Mephisto's soul stone

766
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
is going to potentially convince her to bring Mephisto back

767
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
instead of destroy him like she originally wanted.

768
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So we need to actually make sure that she fulfills her original intent

769
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and doesn't fall to Mephisto's influence.

770
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Nehraal plans to bring the soul stone into the vault of light

771
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
so she can purify the soul stone of Mephisto's essence.

772
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
The vault of light is this really sacred place that Akra created.

773
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
His presence is really important through the history of sanctuary.

774
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Akra wandered the world speaking the teachings of the Zacharom faith.

775
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
His tomb is also said to be in the vault of light which is in Nehraal.

776
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Akraal is the one who discovered the spirit realm.

777
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
When the world stone was forged and sanctuary came out of it,

778
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
his veil was created and that's what created the spirit realm.

779
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Demons aren't there, angels aren't there.

780
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's a very special place for humanity.

781
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And for a long time, the spirit realm was not touched.

782
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And now Mephisto's corruption is creeping its way.

783
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I mean, that's the fear that everybody in Nihon-Tu is thinking about.

784
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Spirituality is really unique to humanity.

785
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And in the jungle, it's a big part of their culture.

786
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Aru is this elder, this magical being, a spirit born.

787
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And he's really connected to Nehon-Tu.

788
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
This is his home. This is his ancestral lineage.

789
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And he's guiding the player on this journey to help Nehraal.

790
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
We actually find out that there have been sightings of Nehraal in Nehon-Tu.

791
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And we end up following her there.

792
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
In Vessel of Hatred, this is a story about isolation.

793
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We start off with the concept that Nehraal is trying to do this alone.

794
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But at some point, you realize that things are escalating.

795
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And so we morph from this idea of isolation into the idea of being stronger together.

796
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
For someone that has been through the journey that our wanderer has, that Nehraal has been through,

797
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
you feel there's hope that sanctuary is not going to be lost.

798
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You get to see pockets of sanctuary that we haven't been able to see before.

799
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But it's still all in this same tone and that same world that everybody loves so much.

800
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Hello Diablo IV community. Welcome to another Diablo IV developer update.

801
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
This is a very special Diablo IV developer update.

802
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So this is our pre-launched stream before Vessel of Hatred,

803
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
which is actually going to be shipping here next week, which is crazy to think about.

804
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm joined here by Mr. Brank Gibson, game director for Diablo IV.

805
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I know before we have our big show, you wanted to talk a little bit about Vessel of Hatred and what's to come.

806
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Yeah, this is a really big week.

807
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
The fact that we're finally on the doorstep of shipping Vessel of Hatred is a bit surreal.

808
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We've been working on it for a very long time.

809
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Over the course of the last five seasons, so much has changed.

810
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And we're excited to talk about some of those details today.

811
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Everything kicks off with our epic journey through Nahan too,

812
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
where we're going to be telling the next chapter of Mifisto.

813
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And it doesn't really stop there.

814
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
We haven't talked about it much yet, but we've actually created a custom quest at the end of the story that leads those players who haven't gotten to endgame.

815
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
We'll get to endgame.

816
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That's awesome.

817
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Along the way, you're also going to find brand new ways to play with the Kiraast Under City.

818
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
We've talked about this time attack dungeon that's super cool.

819
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
We'll go into more detail on that today.

820
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
We have a co-op pve experience with the dark citadel for those hardcore players that like playing with friends.

821
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You're going to have something really cool there.

822
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And we also have brand new ways of gaining power,

823
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
whether you're hiring mercenaries and leveling them up or finding our new powerful runes that create room words to socket into your gear.

824
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You're going to have a lot more ways to actually alter the builds that you've been playing with all this time.

825
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So at the end of all this, we have the star of our show, our class that wants to go fast, the spirit born, which everybody got a sneak peek at that quite a while ago.

826
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And we have been polishing it and getting it ready to make sure that it's the most fun it can be at launch.

827
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah, and it's great because we're actually going to be going through all these aspects today in the live stream with our kind of our subject matter experts across each of them.

828
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So I know as we mentioned next week, the vessel of hatred will actually be shipping and be released to everyone.

829
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Right now, the plan is for it to be out on October 8th.

830
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And that is still very much the plan.

831
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Still the plan.

832
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We actually did release a map earlier this week in our what you need to know blog.

833
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
That kind of pretty much contains exactly when each of the release dates are going to be.

834
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But players can actually end up doing early download right now on a PC battle and that we do have early download coming up for console this weekend on the fifth.

835
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So there's a lot of stuff coming down the pipe, a lot of excitement going on.

836
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The other thing that we did talk about as well is Twitch drops.

837
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We do have a Twitch drops campaign that is actually starting at the launch of vessel of hatred.

838
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
It's actually going to be starting on October 8th in Pacific time.

839
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So it's about like 12, 16 hours some around there afterwards.

840
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But there's some really cool back pieces, really cool weapons that you can earn.

841
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And it goes throughout the whole entire month of October through like that first early part of November.

842
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We also have a support a streamer program this time around, which is really cool because sport of streamer actually really helps out some of the smaller streamers that are actually really wanting to stream the Apple 4, which is really great.

843
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:39,000
If you give two subs for or if you actually purchase two subs across any streamer that is streaming across the Apple 4 and has this enabled, you'll end up receiving the amount that we actually just showed right there.

844
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And if you do an additional two, you actually get the amount armor as well.

845
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So it's a really cool way of helping out some of the smaller and mid-sized streamers out there that really benefit from some of these programs.

846
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And it's great to see all these new faces as they actually jump into vessel of hatred.

847
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The next thing we do also want to talk about is a cool promotion that we're actually doing with trolley here in the US.

848
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Trolley actually makes some candy.

849
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
There are like sour bright crawlers and things like that.

850
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:18,000
There's actually some really cool weapons skins available if you actually purchase trolley specific products here in the US.

851
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
We actually have them here on sets, but you can see all the cool weapons skins.

852
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But if you actually purchase these and you'll see that they're clearly marked with like, the Apple 4, they got the Spiritborn on them.

853
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And you can actually end up taking a photo of your receipt, going to a specific site, and then you'll end up getting the rewards and game.

854
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And you also have a chance of actually winning an Xbox too, which is really cool.

855
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And this is a cool promotion that I think Xbox is actually doing across multitudes of titles, including Will DeWorecraft for instance,

856
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
because this was actually going on with the War Within here at Blizzard.

857
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So yeah, like if you're in the US, look for trolley products.

858
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Thankfully, we have a bunch of bags here, so expect me to actually be eating these around the stream.

859
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
We've had seven bags in two days.

860
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
As we've been like prepping for the stream, this has been my whole entire diet.

861
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Actually, now I've been eating normal food, but at the same time, this is like my cryptidnight right here.

862
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So expect me to be eating these throughout the stream.

863
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's my favorite stream because we have snacks now.

864
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So I'm like, this is perfect. This is perfect.

865
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But one thing, again, we wanted to mention, which is the release date.

866
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And I think we have a release date map here.

867
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So yeah, as you guys can see on October 7th and Irvine at 4pm Pacific, or Pacific time, or California time, if you want to say it.

868
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Is when the actual expansion is going to be launching.

869
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
This is a global launch.

870
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So everyone is coming out at the same time.

871
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The world is round.

872
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So you can't get everyone in on October 8th.

873
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So that's why there's some in on October 7th.

874
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
But we wanted to make sure that we could get as many people in on October 8th.

875
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And of course, a little earlier on October 7th, but everyone's coming out of the exact same time.

876
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So looking forward to everyone jumping in.

877
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
We do have an action-packed show today.

878
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
A lot of stuff to cover.

879
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We are going to be hitting up on the patch 2.0 PTR changes first, as first up in the agenda.

880
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Because we have so many things to share, I will note, this is our 20th live stream for Diablo 4 that we've ever done, which is really cool.

881
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
And this is also our first time we're actually streaming on TikTok.

882
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
We already stream on X. We stream on Twitch, and we stream on YouTube.

883
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So this is kind of a nice momentous occasion.

884
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But because of how much content we have and how many guests we have, we are going to say that we will have some small little breaks while we actually mic new people up, bring them into the studio, and then swap them out for other things.

885
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
But we are going to be talking about first about patch 2.0 PTR and the feedback that we actually received from players.

886
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And then separately, we're also going to be talking about season 6, season of hatred rising.

887
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:12,000
And separately, we will finish off the show with all the vessel of hatred features and going into a little bit more of the deeper dive, something that you were talking about, Brent.

888
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh, yeah. I can't wait. We have so many people coming in that we're having to pack them in rows.

889
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah.

890
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Exactly. You're going to see multiple levels of people in the studio.

891
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So we're going to take a quick break while we get the first group in for our patch 2.0 PTR feedback overview. So we'll see you in a bit.

892
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So we're going to start with the first group.

893
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

894
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

895
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

896
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

897
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

898
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

899
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

900
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

901
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

902
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Awesome. I appreciate everyone bearing with us as we get people mic'd up.

903
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We're going to be doing this a couple times throughout this stream.

904
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But we're here to talk about the PTR learnings from patch 2.0 PTR,

905
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
which we had earlier this month. Super beneficial.

906
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
PTR has been great for us since we've been doing this.

907
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

908
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

909
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

910
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

911
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

912
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

913
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

914
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

915
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And then we're going to start with the first group.

916
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Actually, before we do that, sorry, sorry, sorry, I just realized, no one knows who we are.

917
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
There we go. There we go.

918
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I was just like, wait a minute.

919
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Of course, we have some familiar faces, but if you guys want to do quick intros.

920
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, hi. I'm Colin. I'm a lead designer.

921
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Hey, I'm Aisland. I'm a systems designer.

922
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Hi, I'm Charles. I'm a class designer.

923
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Hey, all I'm Anthony. I'm an associate class designer.

924
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Awesome. Great. There we go. Now we got everyone's idols.

925
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Aisland, do you want to talk about some of the progression changes?

926
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yes, absolutely. So Adam, like you said, the PTR has been just fantastic for us.

927
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's given us so much data and the feedback you guys give is just pivotal to us launching in the state we want to see the game in.

928
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And you know, everyone wants to see the game in.

929
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And so yeah, let's talk about it.

930
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's talk about some changes we've made because of it.

931
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So first of all, monster intensity.

932
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Something we saw in the early game was people weren't noticing the changes in monster intensity because people were skipping through difficulties fairly quickly.

933
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And so we've decided to move monster intensity from scaling over normal, hard, expert, and penitent to scaling over a torment one through four.

934
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Because you're going to be progressing through torments a little bit slower. So you're going to be able to feel the intensity changes I think a little more potent late.

935
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah, there's a bit more jumps, right?

936
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah, absolutely.

937
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And again, the intensity system was essentially monsters just become a little bit more reliable in their damage.

938
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
They sort of predict your movement a little bit more on the projectiles.

939
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's not a massive change, but it should sort of make the monsters feel a little bit more aggressive and dangerous.

940
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah, they just become a little more lethal, I think, ultimately, beyond numerical changes.

941
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The second I want to talk about is one that I'm really, really happy and excited about actually is that elites, unique leets, and super leets are three different types of elites you can actually fight if you know that or not, that's the thing.

942
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And previously, they all did very different amounts of damage from one another.

943
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
For example, a super elite might deal actually two times the amount of damage of a normal elite.

944
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And what that was causing was when an elite spawned in aphics like lightning enchanted or poison or whatever.

945
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The super elites would do two times more damage with those affixes, but you didn't really have any way to tell, right?

946
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
There was no way to tell if an aphics was spawned by an elite or a super elite.

947
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Kind of seemingly randomly, an aphics might deal two times more damage to you out of nowhere.

948
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And so what we've done is we've normalized the damage that all of these different elite types actually deal, so that when you do see the aphics is that they're spewing out, you can expect the damage you're going to receive.

949
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Like you know how much it's going to hit.

950
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
One more consistent.

951
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Way more consistent, way more predictable, which is really helpful for not getting randomly.

952
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
One shot.

953
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Yeah, our fate loves those.

954
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

955
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And then finally on difficulty, we have some changes to standard difficulty tiers.

956
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We know some of you guys are looking for a challenge, so let's take a look at what a challenge looks like.

957
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
All right, so we have a level one character here in Kyivashad going to the statute of change their difficulty.

958
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So what are they going to change it to?

959
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Well, before they could access hard, normal hard and expert, but now they can access penitence at level one.

960
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That's mode we only play.

961
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah.

962
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah.

963
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So you have to beat the base campaign on your account once and then you can go into penitence and let's see how that turns out for this person.

964
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh, yeah.

965
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You know, just a few d.

966
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Oh, few too many demons.

967
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Just a couple few too many demons.

968
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah, I'm mythic unique.

969
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So you can do penitence at level one now.

970
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's pretty hard guys.

971
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So if you plan to go into level one, be prepared.

972
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But seriously, we know people really wanted to be able to push their builds as far as they could, as early as they could.

973
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And now you can.

974
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So whenever you feel like you're ready for penitent during your leveling journey, hop in there and see how you do.

975
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah, I know that was like one of the biggest points of feedback we had during this PTR,

976
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
which was like, hey, we would like to see if penitent wasn't like gated way further down the line and if it could be brought in.

977
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So it's now available at level one.

978
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And you know, as we've shown in the footage, you can be difficult.

979
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But I think what's nice is if someone creates alts and they end up finding a bunch of mythic unique and stuff which you can use at earlier levels.

980
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You then can at least potentially start off in penitent a little bit earlier and stay with a higher difficulty in that type of way, which is nice.

981
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

982
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Really want to embrace like the sort of choose your difficulty that we really liked with the mind cages in season five, four and five.

983
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And again, like to your point, alts just are able to speedrun their way to max level right by playing at a really hard difficulty.

984
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So it should feel a lot better.

985
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And it feels great to just hop into penitent early, like when you're capable of doing it.

986
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
So it's just awesome.

987
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Yeah, we do.

988
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Don't necessarily expect everyone to play at penitent.

989
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's really hard to play at your risk.

990
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It is hard.

991
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah.

992
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah, you need your character needs to be pretty pretty pretty good.

993
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah.

994
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah.

995
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
All right.

996
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Let's talk about some itemization changes.

997
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So we got a lot of feedback that once you got to max level and you were starting that ancestral grind, you were stuck with these non-uncessional items for a pretty long time.

998
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And we do like that, but we know that we people want to see the journey for those non-uncessional items to be a little punchier.

999
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
And so we've made some targeted changes here to ensure that non-uncessional legendaries have more, well, punched to them.

1000
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So we've increased the amount of mass working you can put on a non-uncessional legendary from four to eight.

1001
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We are also allowing them to be tempered twice.

1002
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Previously, both of those values were exclusive to ancestral items, but now non-uncessials can go up to that.

1003
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Additionally, we saw that people were going to like the boss ladder or they were just finding uniques out in the world.

1004
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And they didn't drop as, it didn't feel like they were dropping us ancestral as often as they should have.

1005
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Right. Because they're so rare.

1006
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Right. They're so rare.

1007
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And you know, you want finding a unique item to be an exciting moment.

1008
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And so we've tripled the chance for them to drop us ancestral.

1009
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And this should help a lot, especially during the boss ladder, you know, when you're killing these uber bosses and they're dropping lots of uniques, a lot more of them are going to turn out to be ancestral.

1010
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Definitely. And this should mean that once you're starting around level 60, you have a lot more progression on your equipment that sort of bridges the gap to ancestral.

1011
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I also heard a lot of feedback that that second tempered affix really is what enables your build to come online.

1012
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And that's what we're trying to do with the system of ancestral is that you can get your build online.

1013
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah. But then there's still items that you can chase that just enhance that build.

1014
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Right. And we saw that like not having that second tempered affix and not having those eight master work ranks really sort of hindered your ability to get that build online to get into the fun and start blasting.

1015
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah. Now that's a great point because we don't want you to feel like you have to find ancestral for your build a function.

1016
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And you know, this changes working towards making that true.

1017
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Definitely. So you solve those items you can chase, but you can still get those end game builds online pretty quickly.

1018
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yep. For sure. And finally on itemization, we are adding some scrolls of restoration to the season journey.

1019
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
The scrolls of restoration are the scrolls of tempering that we talked about at Gamescom.

1020
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You can use them to reset the tempering chances on an item.

1021
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And we wanted to add these to the season journey so you could just have a couple of deterministic ways to acquire them and use them on your gear.

1022
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And this of course is not the only place you can earn these scrolls of restoration.

1023
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You know, you can earn them throughout the world. There's a small drop chance. And we'll be actually talking about another way of earning them later on as well.

1024
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Definitely. Yeah.

1025
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So I think one thing that I'm excited about on the unique changes, if you equate greater affixes in season five to ancestral, you're actually going to have a higher chance to get an ancestral unique compared to getting a greater affix on a unique than life.

1026
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So that means that unique are really exciting. You might actually get the staff of endless rage, for example.

1027
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Maybe you're not playing a fireball sort, but now you're like, oh, well, I have an ancestral version of this unique.

1028
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
That's pretty good.

1029
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah.

1030
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So really like, kind of gets you to experiment a little bit more. And we really like that aspect about those unique sometimes being a lot more powerful.

1031
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah. No, it's, it's, we want that moment when you see a unique on the ground to be really fun and exciting.

1032
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And seeing it drop as an ancestral with greater affixes is about as exciting as it gets for a unique. That's pretty cool.

1033
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
All right, let's talk about some player power changes based on PTR feedback.

1034
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So I want to start by framing our goals for torment difficulties.

1035
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So torment one, we want all content to be available in the game. You can fight Lilla, you can fight the boss, you can go to the dark side of the, you know, accept all these activities are available.

1036
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Torment four is intended to be aspirational content. And what that means is you've already unlocked everything in the game when you enter torment one.

1037
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:45,000
But torment four is like the essence of Diablo like build crafting where you're just pushing your character as far as you can go.

1038
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
In torment four exists for that purpose for people who want to push their character as far as they can go.

1039
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And with that said, and the reason why I'm saying this is because we were seeing that people were getting to torment four way faster and way easier than we were hoping for in the PTR.

1040
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And you know, which is just another great, like it's great that we did the PTR because we saw that.

1041
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And with that all said, we've made some changes to kind of keep torment for this, you know, really challenging and exciting thing to reach.

1042
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:21,000
We've reverted the scale damage bonus from mainstatt back to what it was in season five.

1043
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So we had actually doubled it in the PTR, but we found that that was just giving players too much power.

1044
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Too much.

1045
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So we sent it back. And we also pulled back on legendary glyph power a bit. Colin, do you want to talk about that?

1046
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah, so we reduced the scaling on the glyphs quite a bit because we found that it was really devaluing a lot of the aspect roles or roles on your gear.

1047
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Like when you're getting 2000 additive damage from a glyph, it's really hard to actually feel anything on your gear, through tempering or through those affix that are dropping.

1048
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So essentially what we've done is pair that back. We redistributed it. We'll cover that a little bit on where we put some of that power.

1049
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But overall, we think this feels a lot better. Glyphs aren't just carrying like 80% of your power on the build and just feels a lot better so that it doesn't feel as sort of mandatory that I have to get all five glyphs and level them up to actually be pushing different.

1050
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Yeah, it's a lot more about what are the aspects you have? What are the unique? You have what are the nodes you're actually getting on the caravan board? Yeah, I think it feels a lot better.

1051
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah, and like I think one of the important things to say about this is that like it's really awesome to get a tremendous amount of power from one source.

1052
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But because there are so many different sources of power in the game, if one source gives too much power, it makes the other sources feel kind of unimportant.

1053
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And that's not fun. So we want to make sure that every source of power in the game is contributing to your build in very meaningful ways.

1054
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And so this change is helping other sources of power feel really punchy. Definitely.

1055
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Yeah. Awesome. I know tons of changes here with player power, tons of changes with like progression, including difficulty and itemization.

1056
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Do we have anything else on progression? I think one thing I think that's really important to touch on is the torment goals here.

1057
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah, because it's a definite fundamental shift from season five and that you think about World Tier 3 and World Tier 4 and you're sort of racing to get the World Tier 4 as fast as possible because that's where all the best items can drop.

1058
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah. And we've started just changed that to torment one is where all the best items can drop. It's where everything unlocks.

1059
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
But essentially torment two, three and four increase the odds of those things happening. So it's just efficiency.

1060
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yeah. We don't necessarily want to say you must get to torment four to experience the game or to get the best drops in the game similar to World Tier 4 and season five. It's very different feeling.

1061
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So we're excited to see how that plays out and we want to sort of see what you all think as well.

1062
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Yeah, just to reiterate, all of the content, all of the best gear can be found in torment one. So if that's where your build feels most comfortable farming, that's great.

1063
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:58,000
You can still achieve all your goals. You can really max out your character there. It just, you get a reward for pushing this harder difficulty by more efficiency.

1064
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah. And that's like what a fours, torment four, the means to, or like the space to be really hard is because you don't have to get there.

1065
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And so it can be really, really challenging. And you know, some players really love that. And that's awesome.

1066
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Definitely. Awesome. Well, I know the next topic we want to talk about is some of the big system changes that are actually coming with Vessel of Hatred.

1067
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But and also changes that we're applying post-PTR from things that we actually learned. Call in. You want to walk us through and start us off with some of the paradigms stuff?

1068
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Yeah, absolutely. So again, we got a ton of feedback from the PTR. And we took a look at Paragon. That was one of the bigger changes that we made where we kept the boards.

1069
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Because we feel like that gives us a lot more space to increase the power of each of these boards and make the choice more about what is the board you're looking for.

1070
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So what we've done here is we've added a bunch of normal notes. So those are things like stats that empower those glyphs to upgrade that legendary glyph radius.

1071
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:04,000
We added them. It was kind of sad. Like there weren't actually a lot of nodes to flesh it out and sort of build up that Paragon, that extra glyph range that you're going to get from upgrading it to legendary.

1072
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So we've done that. We added around eight to every board. And then the starting board, I think we went to like 12 or something like that just because, you know, the starting board should feel really good with that first glyph.

1073
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
The next thing we've done is we've taken a look at a lot of the rare and magic nodes and we've just made them generically more useful.

1074
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So you think about like two handed bludgeoning damage on the barbarian is like, OK, like I guess I guess I can only benefit if I'm doing this one very specific thing.

1075
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And we've just opened that up to say damage, right? That's going to scale everything across your character as opposed to like while you're doing this sort of obscure thing.

1076
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,000
So we think that feels a lot better. We've also just sort of taken a look at what are the affixes we're giving like potion healing.

1077
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I know you're all going to be really sad. I know you're all super sad to see that we've taken the potion healing out.

1078
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
But we've just changed it to healing received. We've also just taken a look at things like damage reduction from dots and made a damage reduction.

1079
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
So it should be a lot more generically useful and this board should feel a lot more punchy and open ended, which we really like.

1080
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And that's sort of doubling down on the spirit of what we've done with season four atomization, right?

1081
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Just sort of taking back some of these conditional things aren't necessarily adding a ton of value to your build identity, just opening things up.

1082
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And then the next thing we've done is we talked about redistributing some of the power on those glyphs.

1083
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And we've taken a look at all of our nodes, all of magic and rare nodes and we've just buffed all of them.

1084
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,000
So we've doubled all the additive bonuses on rare and magic nodes. We've increased the damage reduction values by about 1.5x.

1085
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So they should feel a lot more chunky. And as you're journeying through paragon, right? It should feel like you have more options than to just bum rush every glyph, socket and every legendary node.

1086
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
There should be some pretty punchy like damage sources that you can get, damage reduction sources you can get.

1087
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We've also done things like all the resistance nodes you have on the paragon board actually give max resistance as well now.

1088
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
So it's pretty powerful. We've done a lot of changes there.

1089
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:07,000
So this is one of the first steps we're taking to really improve the paragon system with the new sort of philosophy of like we want you to pick what boards you want.

1090
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And we expect to be updating more in the future.

1091
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So yeah, absolutely. And I think that this harkens back to what we were just saying, which is that it's really fun for all of your sources of power to be meaningful.

1092
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And so we're basically just taking like the tons and tons of power that was in glyphs and kind of slightly redistributing it to paragon.

1093
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So going through your paragon board is just more interesting fun.

1094
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Definitely.

1095
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Cool. Next up we got I think in frontal hordes.

1096
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yes. So if you remember, infernal hordes was under construction during the PTR as we were fitting in, like how does this going to work with the greater equipment chess turning into ancestral items.

1097
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And there are three things that we really wanted to tackle as a part of this release, right?

1098
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Infernal hordes is an eternal game mode. So we wanted to take the learnings we got from season five and apply it to this next update.

1099
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So one of the things we saw was that loot was just dominating the reward landscape here, like getting 200 legendaries from one source of activity is cool for season five.

1100
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And it's the brand new activity for season five. That's awesome. But we wanted to just readjust it, refit it back in.

1101
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
We still have the codex of power that lets you store all these legendary powers. So we felt like we wanted to take more of a quality over quantity approach here.

1102
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And one of the things that was sort of frustrating about that quality miss was that you didn't really have a way to reliably target those unique items that were coming out of infernal hordes.

1103
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
If you think about it, you had to open a chest and just hope that you're going to get one of the unique items out of this chest.

1104
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And that sort of led to a frustrating and tedious reward flow. We're just constantly opening up these 28th of chest over and over and over.

1105
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I know I've spent, you know, probably more time opening the material chest than actually.

1106
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I mean, I think that's everyone's favorite pastime. Just like running around the material.

1107
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah.

1108
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I was like, I'm going to just give me my connection.

1109
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Yeah.

1110
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So it's excellent.

1111
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So we've taken a look at, you know, how we're going to actually deliver these keys.

1112
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
We've taken them out of the crafting system, but they're not too rare.

1113
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,000
They're just uncommonly found throughout the world. We want this to be like an ocean moment when the key drops just because you're going to get a ton of XP from the chest.

1114
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And a ton of XP from killing the hordes, going to get a ton of materials and a ton of items as well.

1115
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So we think that's that that will make the keys feel a lot more interesting.

1116
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And it's not going to blow your inventory as much.

1117
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Yeah.

1118
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
You really want to use them when you get them.

1119
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So the next part here is if we could go back to slide, if we could go to inferno hordes.

1120
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I think it's a whole different hordes.

1121
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
There you go.

1122
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,000
The council boss, no matter what, as long as you kill that council, they're going to drop dungeon boss loot, which is going to be legendary.

1123
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
There is crafting materials, gold, etc. on top of the inferno hord unique items.

1124
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And that's going to scale its torment.

1125
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
So guaranteed every single time you kill that council, you're going to get unique items that are specific to inferno hordes.

1126
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That's great because those inferno hordes unique start pretty sick.

1127
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Definitely.

1128
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So no more waiting at the chest to get that drop.

1129
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It's just going to happen.

1130
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It feels a lot more like a boss ladder where it's like, okay, I want to get inferno hord unique items.

1131
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm going to be able to reliably get those and get a pull at the sort of slot machine there.

1132
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And then the next thing here is we've updated the chest.

1133
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
So the chest of greater equipment are going to drop the scrolls of restoration or retempering.

1134
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So you're going to be able to get them reliably from the inferno hordes, not just the dark citadel.

1135
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And that should feel pretty meaty and good.

1136
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And then we've also guaranteed some amount of ancestral items from that greater equipment chest.

1137
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And ancestral items are very much more coveted than just greater affix items.

1138
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
So that should feel pretty meaty.

1139
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And then the chest of materials is now just going to convert all your aether into materials.

1140
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You don't have to like constantly finish your tasks.

1141
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So we're going to turn into a bunch of master working materials, gems.

1142
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It should feel a lot more snappy and less time looting or time playing.

1143
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And the gold chest is the same.

1144
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Yeah.

1145
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Yeah.

1146
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It skips a punch.

1147
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Next up, I know we have the rewards stuff.

1148
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
We kind of spoiled your.

1149
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I know.

1150
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So we can just skip this.

1151
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Yeah.

1152
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So rewards.

1153
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
There's just a bunch of miscellaneous tuning and making the game feel better and more rewarding.

1154
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah.

1155
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So we've significantly increased ancestral shop rate from nightmare dungeons and whispers.

1156
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Thank you to a person who ran a thousand.

1157
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Yeah.

1158
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Definitely fixed the problem there.

1159
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And that should feel a lot more rewarding.

1160
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
We've also added just experience to the nightmare dungeon completion, which just feels better as we're grinding that.

1161
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Paragon, also while you're leveling up, it's like a pretty good hit of XP.

1162
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And then we've also done miscellaneous buffs to just miscellaneous things.

1163
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,000
So hellborne will drop loot butcher is going to drop guaranteed axe, I believe, of butcher's axe.

1164
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
The world boss treasure goblins, those are all going to drop a lot better loot.

1165
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
It's also kind of scale with torment, which should feel good.

1166
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It makes sense for these, I guess the hellborne is not exactly a random encounter.

1167
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And I just the world boss, but the butcher and the treasure goblins, these big media encounters.

1168
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It makes sense for these to occur and you're like, give me good loot because this is uncommon.

1169
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
This doesn't happen that frequently.

1170
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I want it to be amazing.

1171
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It's an exciting moment and the loot should reflect that.

1172
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Yeah.

1173
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I love that loot explosion.

1174
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Yeah.

1175
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
We have treasure goblins.

1176
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah.

1177
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Nothing beats finding a treasure goblins at level five.

1178
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah.

1179
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Just chasing it around using your basic stuff.

1180
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yeah, and the guarantee drops legendary no matter what level you are.

1181
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

1182
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
It should feel pretty good.

1183
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,000
The next thing here is we really love how players or how you all have sort of embraced the stronghold experience bonus.

1184
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
We've actually just done that across the game.

1185
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So campaign feels really good in terms of experience granted.

1186
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Sidequests should feel really good, especially in the hunt too.

1187
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:47,000
But what we saw with the stronghold experience in the PTR is that two levels felt a little bit aggressive and like sort of forced you to do stronghold over and over.

1188
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yeah.

1189
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
We've just paired that back down to 1.25 levels, which is still really meaty.

1190
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Like you're getting an entire level from doing these.

1191
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Yeah.

1192
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's really fulfilling what we had hoped strongholds were going to provide, which is an alternative means to level.

1193
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
If you want to ride around the open world and do a bunch of strongholds, that's absolutely a viable way to level up now.

1194
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,000
We think that like all the quest content in general just feels a lot better because there are a lot more generous there.

1195
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
The other change I'll note here is that a bulk of that experience is going to be from killing the boss.

1196
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And it's a first time reward.

1197
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
That means you're not going to be able to sort of, you know, cheese running strongholds over and over and over.

1198
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Thank you.

1199
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Thank you, Rax for showing that about your friends from your chat that did that in 20 minutes.

1200
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yeah.

1201
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It was a good video.

1202
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah.

1203
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And in all fairness.

1204
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Cool.

1205
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And then the next one here is we heard a ton of feedback that Rare and Magic items just felt like they're adding a lot of noise to torment.

1206
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
We're dropping a lot more of them.

1207
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Now they just get autosuppaged in torment.

1208
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Great.

1209
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Get about it here.

1210
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yeah, get about it.

1211
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Yeah, get about it.

1212
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And then the next one is just a nice quality of life.

1213
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
The Paragon Glyphs now drop from the pit.

1214
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So when you're doing a bunch of pit runs, you're also going to be getting glyphs.

1215
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
It just means you don't really have to like go out and do other things if you have a bunch of keys with the pit.

1216
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Yeah.

1217
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I mean, that's really nice too because, you know, theoretically you could enter the pit and not actually have a glyph, but now you will.

1218
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So you can find one level up if that's what happens.

1219
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Awesome. And I know last but not least we have kind of itemization crap.

1220
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
This is some big stuff here that I know will excite players for sure.

1221
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeah.

1222
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:29,000
So one of the things you've heard a ton from the player base and then you all is that I wish I could make a mythic unique deterministically.

1223
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:35,000
If I do everything at a season, if I kill Uber Lilith, if I do the seasons journey, I want to be able to get a mythic unique.

1224
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And we saw this as an opportunity to essentially create an identity between the rune crafting of mythic uniques and the blacksmith, we moved it from the alchemist to the blacksmith, the blacksmith version of crafting mythic uniques.

1225
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So now what you're going to be able to do is you're going to be able to take two respondent sparks to the blacksmith and get around a mythic unique.

1226
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
That means no matter what, as long as you do everything in the season, you're going to get a mythic unique.

1227
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And if you take those respondent sparks and you decide I really want a specific mythic unique.

1228
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
You'll be able to take a set of runes and actually pick which one.

1229
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And what that does is the runes are a lot more flexible. They can be traded.

1230
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You can also get some incremental progress because they drop a lot more frequently than a mythic unique or sparks in general.

1231
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:27,000
So what this means is you now have two really clear means to sort of target mythic uniques and you now have a guaranteed way to make a mythic unique at the end of a season, which we think will feel really good.

1232
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So then that's kind of cool about that is that it gives runes this intrinsic trade value.

1233
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Check out a lot of like they they have this big purpose towards crafting one of the best items in the game.

1234
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Which is really cool. Finally, finally can get my Starless Skies.

1235
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Yeah.

1236
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Cool. And then the next one here is you're going to be getting a lot of salvage and torment because everything's getting auto salvaged.

1237
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
So we figured you know we should probably give you some purpose and value to that salvage.

1238
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And now you can take it to the blacksmith and forge random legendary equipment at the blacksmith.

1239
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yeah, this is huge.

1240
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I love this change.

1241
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
And it also has a chance to be unique or mythic and sometimes ancestral.

1242
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So it's definitely a great place to dump all that salvage access salvage that you have.

1243
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And then the next one here is more sort of a quality of life and nicety we added runes and we're putting way more sockets on gear.

1244
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah.

1245
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
We just allowed you to add sockets to gear with just the general salvage material.

1246
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
You don't need a scattered prisms anymore.

1247
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Scattered prisms are required for ancestral items.

1248
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And that just essentially means you know, ah, missing a socket can pretty easily add one.

1249
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And then the next one here is mostly quality of life for alt characters.

1250
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
But the jeweler no longer has a level requirement to engage with the jeweler.

1251
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Previously on the PTR you had to like trade gear to your main character.

1252
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Addis socket is super tedious and we just made it not like that.

1253
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Awesome.

1254
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So tons of big changes coming across it and multitude of systems within d4.

1255
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Thanks to a lot of great feedback that we got from all the players within the community, content creators, etc.

1256
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So thank you guys so much for that.

1257
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Thank you Colin for walking us through that.

1258
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Next up we want to talk about some of the class changes and everything.

1259
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
And so Charles here is going to walk us through it.

1260
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah, I love to talk about some of the class changes that we saw in the PTR.

1261
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Once again, I want to thank all of the players who you know, gave a lot of detail, detailed feedback, a lot of data on you know, how classes were performing, all the different builds and the new new items, new effects and all that kind of stuff, new skills.

1262
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's been really helpful in helping to make sure that we make all our class designs as fun and engaging as possible.

1263
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I do want to say that you know, this patch is huge.

1264
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
There's lots of changes, you know, as I said, a lot of new class stuff, but a lot of new systems stuff across the whole game.

1265
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And so we do expect some level of like volatility here and you know, when a lot of things change, there's a lot of unknowns.

1266
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
And so that's just the mindset we're approaching this patch with.

1267
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And what we're going to be talking about here is not a complete detailed list of everything that we've changed from the PTR to live.

1268
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:06,000
It's just kind of some samples and kind of talking through our learnings and what we saw on the class design team and what we're thinking about.

1269
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And so make sure you check out the full patch notes once we're done with the stream.

1270
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And also if you a lot of the changes came in the PTR initially.

1271
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So definitely check out those if you're unfamiliar because there's tons of class changes there as well.

1272
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Oh yeah.

1273
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,000
So starting with the barbarian, we generally saw that barbarian class was a little bit too weak on the PTR.

1274
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
And I think even on season five, I think it's just generally considered a little too weak.

1275
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Historically though, it's been one of our stronger classes, but you know, in recent seasons it's fallen a little bit on harder times.

1276
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
So a lot of our focus here is buffs to some underutilized skills and legendaries and uniques.

1277
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So we've got updates to upheaval to make it just a little bit more punchy, hits a little bit harder.

1278
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:56,000
We've got updates to some of the uniques that talk to other core skills, like Hammer of the Ancient and Double Swing to give them a little bit more damage boost as well.

1279
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And finally there's a buff to the martial vigor passive.

1280
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That is a passive in the skill tree that gives you some damage reduction from elite enemies including bosses.

1281
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And it might seem pretty small on paper, it's just 4% to 6%.

1282
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But for every skill rank you have in that, you get that much more.

1283
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And really when you're fighting the late game tormented bosses and high tormenteers, it's going to be a pretty noticeable amount of survivability against those boss fights for barbarians.

1284
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Yeah, those passive skills add up really quickly when you start getting a bunch of ranks and stuff.

1285
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So for sure.

1286
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Absolutely.

1287
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Moving on to the druid, we also think the druid was a little bit on the weaker end of the classes.

1288
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I think there was a few bugs on the PTR that were addressing as we go live where some of their effects specifically in the paragon and some of the key passives weren't quite working exactly how we intended.

1289
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So they might have been a little bit weaker due to that on the PTR specifically.

1290
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
So we're definitely addressing those.

1291
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I also wanted to talk about nature's fury.

1292
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:03,000
This is a key passive that whenever you cast an earth or storm skill, there's a chance to cast the same skill of the opposite type.

1293
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And this was causing some unintended interactions with one of the unique items, the earth breaker ring, that ended up procing or triggering nature's fury way more often than we intended.

1294
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That's because we have this concept of casts where you actually need to press the button and then hey, you did one cast.

1295
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And whenever we do something like auto casts, which is like, hey, I triggered a free skill with nature's fury, that shouldn't kind of recursively trigger or trigger the other effects that are looking for casts.

1296
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But in that particular interaction it was.

1297
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And so we've fixed that interaction.

1298
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,000
But then thrown some pretty big buffs to those items and the things affected in that build.

1299
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:51,000
We still expect those kind of things, especially landslide builds that use this a lot to still be very powerful builds going forward.

1300
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But we just didn't want that one particular unintended interaction to be happening.

1301
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And that kind of over shines all the builds, right?

1302
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
When you have one build that's crazy over the top.

1303
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Exactly.

1304
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Yeah, especially whenever there's one build that's so dominant, it really makes it feel like, hey, I'm playing the class wrong if I'm not doing this.

1305
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And that's not something that we want.

1306
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:22,000
We want you to be able to play all the different ways of playing the classes and feel like it's a valid and viable choice to compete or to complete the game.

1307
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Some of the other changes on Druid as well.

1308
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
We've got some updates to great staff of the Cron.

1309
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,000
One of my favorite items that lets your claw and storm strike build kind of synergize really nicely.

1310
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
We've got just a lot more damage on werewolf skills through the lust for carnage Paragon node.

1311
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Basically the same functionality, but just added 50% bonus damage there.

1312
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
We saw werewolfs was particularly falling behind.

1313
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And update to the untamed parah legendary Paragon node.

1314
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
This is the new one that talks to companion skills.

1315
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Previously just gave skill ranks, which kind of fell off as you got a lot of skill ranks.

1316
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Now it's just multiplicative damage and I'm really looking forward to seeing awesome companion Druids in the new season, especially with the new key passive.

1317
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Moving on to the necromancer.

1318
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:13,000
The necromancer is a class that I think we saw a lot of variety for blood, bone and shadow builds.

1319
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
A lot of those were competing very well, but necromancer is really all about minions.

1320
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Unfortunately we saw minion builds really falling behind from where we want.

1321
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And we know that minion builds are like the most appealing part of a necromancer.

1322
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And so on the class of the 19 we're really committed to making sure that minion necromancer is good.

1323
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And we're going to see some massive buffs to this patch.

1324
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And we're going to continue monitoring to make sure that the minion fantasy is really a powerful and compelling one.

1325
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
We also saw that necromancer was one of the squishier classes.

1326
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It had a little bit less defensive umph than we really wanted.

1327
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And so we've made some updates here to reap.

1328
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's going to give a little bit longer damage reduction.

1329
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
It just makes that a little bit more usable for that that function.

1330
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Same with necrotic fortitude. It gives a little bit more barrier.

1331
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
This is kind of a passive barrier generation.

1332
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
So just a little bit more survivability in that late game.

1333
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And then the rest of it here is just talking about minion buffs, right?

1334
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
We've got Kalen's edict, the key passive.

1335
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
This is going to do previously. It just gave you a attack speed for your minions.

1336
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Now it's also going to give you bonus multiplicative damage for all your minions.

1337
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
A bunch of the legendaries and uniques that talked to minions like Ring of Mendel and Shade Mist.

1338
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
That damage is now properly attributed to your minions rather than the necromancer themselves.

1339
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Which means if you have bonus golem damage for instance and your golem figures Ring of Mendel,

1340
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
it's now going to benefit properly and it's going to be multiplied up by those multipliers.

1341
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So pretty big buffs for those legendaries and uniques.

1342
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Yeah, that's a lot of power for sure.

1343
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Absolutely. So moving on, we've got Nexonus, we'll talk about the Rogue.

1344
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I think the Rogue in general was performing pretty well across the board in the PTR.

1345
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I think we got a lot of positive feedback. Like hey, yeah, Rogue feels great.

1346
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I just, you know, said the win.

1347
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yes, the use of the Dance of Nye skill in particular.

1348
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
It's awesome.

1349
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yeah, it was really happy with where Dance of Nye's landed.

1350
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,000
As the new skill, it found a lot of use in a variety of builds and people have a lot of fun playing with it.

1351
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:18,000
We did notice a little bit of the melee focus builds with Flurry and twisting blades falling behind just a little bit.

1352
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:26,000
So a few of our changes here are focused on enhancing the legendaries that talk to those two in circling blades and blade dancers.

1353
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:33,000
In terms of key passives, we saw victimized did have a bug that caused its damage scaling to be higher than intended.

1354
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And so we affixed that math calculation on how it kind of scales damage based on other damage.

1355
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Because it was really just a little bit too dominant.

1356
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And now we think with this update, it'll still be a competitive choice.

1357
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
But it won't completely outshine every other key passive on the Rogue.

1358
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And some nice little buffs here to Rain of Arrows just to make it work a little bit better with Inbume and Skills.

1359
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Love me some Rain of Arrows. It's a very flashy skill, especially with almost colors with the Inbume and Sonnet.

1360
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Alright, and finally the Sorcerer. The Sorcerer was definitely the strongest class.

1361
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I think we saw on the PTR by a fair margin. Just a little bit.

1362
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It was quite strong. People were having a lot of fun with Sorcerer builds, especially with the new key passive enlightenment.

1363
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And enlightenment had an issue where it's all about alternating skill casts.

1364
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Okay, you cast Fire skill, you cast Lighting skill, you cast Cold skill, and you get these stacks really quickly.

1365
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Unfortunately, it was stacking up unintentionally from some of those auto casts that we were talking about earlier with Nature's Fury,

1366
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:43,000
where when you trigger bonus casts from unstable currents, it was actually ramping up the enlightenment way too fast.

1367
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And so we fixed that interaction, but we think despite that, enlightenment is still one of the strongest key passives this time.

1368
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So it just brings it down a little bit, but we still think this is going to be really powerful and compelling new key passive to play with.

1369
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Once we go live. Two other changes here with the Flamescar and OXULUS Uniques.

1370
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:12,000
This is kind of adding in this chance to deal double damage affixes for Incinerate and Teleport respectively.

1371
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:22,000
This harkens back to what I talked about on the PTR stream, where we're adding these multiplicative damage bonuses into tempering for weapons.

1372
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And of course, we can't temper onto unique items, but for a lot of the unique items that are about very specific skills, such as Flamescar and OXULUS,

1373
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:46,000
we've taken a pass to add in some of these affixes that enhance those skills in multiplicative ways to really make sure that Incinerate gets the same benefit from using that unique as opposed to just a legendary that you would temper this affix onto anyway.

1374
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It's a massive buff.

1375
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Yes, absolutely massive.

1376
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That's good.

1377
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It'll be like, Platter, Bruler, like, is it actually?

1378
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Yeah, actually.

1379
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Is it working?

1380
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Yeah, Incinerate size and Teleport size may be not the most compelling affix.

1381
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Now you just get some of this multiplicative damage.

1382
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
If somebody wants to make an Oculus build where most of the damage comes from Teleport, that's going to be awesome.

1383
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I'll see if you can manage to make that work.

1384
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Yeah, I love that idea.

1385
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Oh my god.

1386
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I already have a build page saved.

1387
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I love to see that.

1388
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
That's nice.

1389
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So yeah, once again, I just want to thank everyone for all the great feedback.

1390
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:32,000
We on the class design team picture are always reading and listening to feedback on how you're playing the classes, what builds your finding fun, what things are over or underpowered.

1391
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:41,000
We listen to it, we read your feedback, we watch the videos that you make, we really appreciate all of it, and it really helps us to make the game as best as possible.

1392
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Awesome.

1393
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Thank you so much, Charles, for walking us through all the changes coming for classes.

1394
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
It's actually not all the changes that we saw right here.

1395
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
As Charles mentioned, we do have patch notes actually going live after this stream.

1396
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And I will caveat you will see 2.0.1 patch notes, and you'll see 2.0.2 patch notes.

1397
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
So there's 202 and 201.

1398
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
202 is actually not on people's PCs yet.

1399
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
We haven't preloaded that.

1400
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:15,000
That is going to be the last update you'll need to grab before we jump into launch for a vessel of hatred.

1401
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:22,000
But you will get all the patch notes after the streams you're going to dig through all the class changes that we didn't cover in all the ins and outs of it.

1402
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And between now and what we have for PTR.

1403
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
So last but not least, we have rune words.

1404
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So I think we're going to jump straight into it.

1405
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
So I think you want to go ahead.

1406
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1407
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
So again, awesome feedback.

1408
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
We got lots of different things that came in.

1409
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:47,000
And we've heard multiple times in a couple different things with the rune words that really just people kept repeating over and over again.

1410
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Really, mostly stemming down to two major issues with the whole system.

1411
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And so previously, we had, on the PTR, we had the legendary runes that were a lot stronger because you want to reach that point eventually

1412
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
to where you get the powerful runes and then you play the game that way.

1413
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Well, that was kind of outshining a lot of the other possibilities and like the idea that we had with the runes where you're mixing and matching, creating different combinations.

1414
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,000
So what we are ending up doing now is we are taking that top end and we're going to bring it down.

1415
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And then on the flip side, the second thing that we heard a lot of is those bottom runes.

1416
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I don't want to say bottom runes.

1417
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:45,000
The magic and rare runes that you find a little earlier, especially those runes of ritual where you are, those are the ones where you're actually doing things to gain offering to then invoke those runes of invocation, those powers that you have.

1418
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Those were intentionally a bit lower so that you have some progress.

1419
01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:00,000
But it felt like when you get them, it wasn't enough. You didn't get to really feel those runes happen and pop off when you get them.

1420
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So on the other side, we are taking that bottom end and bringing it up.

1421
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:19,000
So together, we're kind of, I don't want to say flattening out, but we are making it a lot more options for the players to really have choices throughout your whole journey rather than just a linear, you know, get the stronger one.

1422
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:32,000
And then obviously it's stronger. And what this will also do and the focus on this is to also make those utility runes really, really potent and really pop off and a lot more visual things that happen.

1423
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And then finally, we removed a couple of runes that weren't quite meeting our expectations.

1424
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We have this thing that we say every once in a while, which is like condense the fun.

1425
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And we want to make that, you know, like the ideal situation where we have, you know, the runes that we have are the ones that are cool and fun and not like overblowed it with just a bunch of things that don't always meet those expectations.

1426
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So we want you to have lots of options and we don't want individual runes or effects to really overshadow everything else.

1427
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
But that does mean that, you know, we want to make sure that all the options are really compelling.

1428
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
And so ones that aren't meeting our bar, we just would rather take them out rather than leave them in.

1429
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1430
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I think we're always going to be adding to the rune system.

1431
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Of course.

1432
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,000
So one of the other things we didn't want to water down the pool of things like the lightning bolt effect room.

1433
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
It's like that didn't really have, it was an evolutionary dead ends.

1434
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
We didn't necessarily have any way to juice that up.

1435
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
So we want one of rune drops for it to feel like, oh, there's this new toy I can play with, right?

1436
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It's important that every choice in the rune system is meaningful.

1437
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Like every possible rune you can take or combination, like there's something there, right?

1438
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Yeah, you want to feel it, for sure.

1439
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And it doesn't want to be something that, you know, you just like, oh, I got this run and it's like, well, let me find another one.

1440
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Alright, so here's some examples of some of the big outliers.

1441
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
We heard lots, lots of feedback around these two, especially that Lord Cry run.

1442
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
So while it was getting berserking to everyone, it was a big power bonus.

1443
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And so we're going to bring that down a little bit by just, it's no longer going to give that enhanced version.

1444
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
It's just a baseline version.

1445
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So it no longer gives berserking to all players.

1446
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
That does mean it still works for barbarians because that is their skill.

1447
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
They should still be able to gain that power as they would expect.

1448
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,000
And then down with the, the YAM, which is that druid petrify, the rune itself is not changing.

1449
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:36,000
What's actually changing is on druids themselves, their ultimate there is no longer going to give that critical bonus baseline.

1450
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's not going to be the enhanced version.

1451
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So if you want that as a druid, you can still get that big powerful critical damage bonus.

1452
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:50,000
But now that baseline is going to be that big stun, that big AOE moment that you see everything on the screen freeze.

1453
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And also just juice you up with a bunch of resource.

1454
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
And this is general, like class resource.

1455
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So unlike what it'll say for the druid, as it says, their spirit goes up.

1456
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
On the rune, it says it is your resource.

1457
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So everyone gets this huge big moment where you can kind of reset.

1458
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
So if I'm a sorcerer, it doesn't generate spirit, it generates mana.

1459
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Yes, you don't just get a second bubble that has to fill up the sphere.

1460
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
That's very true.

1461
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
That's very weird.

1462
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I like that this puts a lot more emphasis on the utility of runes, which is sort of what we have been originally intending right now.

1463
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Every choice is going to be a multiplicative damage source.

1464
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
So you should have a lot more options.

1465
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
It's more focused on utility.

1466
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1467
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Stealing other classes power.

1468
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Obviously, multiplicative damage is probably the single strongest thing you can do in an ARPG.

1469
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:46,000
And just when we notice these ones were really those ones that are overshadowing every other option.

1470
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:52,000
We still think those will find a great niche for the builds that want it, but they won't be the only choice that no one else can use anything else.

1471
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Yeah.

1472
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Absolutely, absolutely.

1473
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
All right, so here's some examples.

1474
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Again, I want to preface.

1475
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
This is not all of them.

1476
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
There are a bunch of changes.

1477
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
You guys will see them in the patch notes as we had already talked about.

1478
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
But some of the big ones that I wanted to show off here.

1479
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So the spirit-borne vortex.

1480
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
That's the one that pulls everyone in.

1481
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
You group everything together.

1482
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:22,000
That is going to be almost, you're going to be able to get that off almost twice as often as it was before.

1483
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:28,000
So you're combine that in with something that has some grindy damage in the middle.

1484
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:35,000
And you're going to be just having this pop off all the time as well as so we call them subpowers.

1485
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:41,000
There's things like the sorcerer meteorites or like the barbarian earthquakes.

1486
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Those things that happen based on other things, but they create like another power that comes out.

1487
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
We are juicing those up a lot more.

1488
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:56,000
So these should be some of the most powerful versions of these subpowers in the game from these runes.

1489
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
As you can see here, meteorites is jumping up a whole bunch as well as the offering cost is going down.

1490
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
So you're going to be able to summon a lot more of these as well.

1491
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And then one of the other things I saw feedback was around the the se.

1492
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Rune.

1493
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I don't know exactly how to say it myself.

1494
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I don't ask you even about that after this.

1495
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
But where you summon spirit wolves.

1496
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And they didn't feel as impactful because their AI was not as poppy as like say the necromancers, minions running around a lot more quickly.

1497
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
So we adjusted that.

1498
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And so we're going to have a video coming up here in a second and we can see.

1499
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So now you're going to summon those wolves.

1500
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
They're going to pop up and do their attack.

1501
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And if you jump to the next pack, they're going to jump forward.

1502
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Except this is going to happen a lot more frequently than before.

1503
01:23:49,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So now if you say fight that pack, jump to the next one, every time those wolves are going to just keep jumping and keep leaping, this works in ranged as well.

1504
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So if you're fighting some enemy over here to the left and you attack them, your wolves are going to jump immediately over there.

1505
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And then if you switch to this other group on the right, those wolves are going to jump across the screen because we've also increased the number of wolves.

1506
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And then we've increased that aggro range as well for that.

1507
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Yeah, they feel a lot more responsive.

1508
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And even in that clip, we saw them jumping to the pack at basically the same time we did.

1509
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
They are right there with you. They're not lagging behind.

1510
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And that's always like the worst feeling when you're like, hey, some of this thing at where?

1511
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
What are they doing?

1512
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
They're lagging behind me.

1513
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
They're lagging behind me.

1514
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
They're longer lazy dogs.

1515
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Yeah, they're tired.

1516
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
They were tired.

1517
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
They were tired.

1518
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Tired little pups, you know?

1519
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And then here are some examples of those rings of ritual.

1520
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Again, those are the ones that are generating this offering.

1521
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:54,000
And so these are mostly going to be changes to those magic and rare rings, where we've taken that offering they give.

1522
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And we've really knocked it up to be a lot closer to where those legendary versions of these are.

1523
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And that should hopefully give us a lot more options when it comes to deciding which combination of which rings that we are using.

1524
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
And also just means things are a lot more reliable.

1525
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Like you're actually getting rocks way more often with these buffs.

1526
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Yeah, you actually get to see the fun happen, right?

1527
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
See those effects happen a little bit more often.

1528
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Yeah, so tons of room changes that are coming.

1529
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And as Anthony mentioned, there's way more details in the actual patch notes themselves.

1530
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:35,000
So people can check that out after the stream along with all the class changes, the system changes, the progression changes.

1531
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It's all detailed out there for players specifically.

1532
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
You know, I had one thing, because I think we might have forgotten it.

1533
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And I'm very concerned about monitor violence.

1534
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Oh, yes.

1535
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,000
We heard a lot of people were wanting to punch and punch their monitors.

1536
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Oh, that's right.

1537
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
When you get a greater apex on impairment resistance.

1538
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
So yeah, as monitor enthusiasts, we've just removed that from the affix pool.

1539
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Yes. Please don't.

1540
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Please don't.

1541
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Let's punch.

1542
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I think less punching of monitor.

1543
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Save the monitors for me.

1544
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
And one thing I do want to call it on rune words.

1545
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
We actually, funny enough, we got a lot of feedback about players saying,

1546
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:18,000
like, hey, we noticed like different art on some of the classic runes that they may have seen from like the back in D2.

1547
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
That art has been updated to match what you saw in D2.

1548
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
So it's fast.

1549
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Yes.

1550
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
That's great.

1551
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Yeah, shout out to the history of runes there for everyone.

1552
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
So thank you guys for jumping into this.

1553
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And I will say, like, this team is going to be staying vigilant through the launch of vessel of hatred with our live ops teams here.

1554
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Shout out to our live ops team who will be helping us out through multitudes of patches, hot fixes.

1555
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
We're going to be paying attention to community and hearing all the feedback that players have.

1556
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
And we'll be jumping on a lot of the big things that we do notice.

1557
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And we do want to jump, like kind of address earlier on,

1558
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
especially right after launch.

1559
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So our cadence is going to be quick.

1560
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
So do expect that.

1561
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
We'll be posting all notes, all hot fix notes, etc. whenever they do come up.

1562
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
So thank you guys.

1563
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Again, for joining us today to talk about the PTR learnings.

1564
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Next up, we actually are going to start talking about the next season coming to Diablo IV, which is season six.

1565
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And that will actually start with the launch of vessel of hatred.

1566
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
We're going to do another quick Mike Swap musical chairs thing.

1567
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Maybe we turn on Benny Hill music or something like that.

1568
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
But we'll be right back here with our next group to talk about season six.

1569
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Music

1570
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Music

1571
01:29:46,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Music

1572
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Music

1573
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:46,000
