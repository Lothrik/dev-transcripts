60
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:59,000

63
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Thank you.

64
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:59,000


65
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Thank you.

66
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Thank you.

67
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Thank you.

68
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You heard about the

69
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:08,000
here in the US. Trolli actually makes some candy. They're like Sour Bright Crawlers and things like

70
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
that. There's actually some really cool weapon skins available if you actually purchase Trolli

71
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
specific products here in the US. We actually have them here on set, but you can see all the

72
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
cool weapon skins. But if you actually purchase these and you'll see that they're clearly marked

73
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
with like Diablo 4, they got the Spirit Porn on them. And you can actually end up taking a photo

74
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
of your receipt, going to a specific site, and then you'll end up getting kind of the rewards in game.

75
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And you also have a chance of actually winning an Xbox too, which is really cool. And this is a

76
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
cool promotion that I think Xbox is actually doing across multitudes of titles, including like World

77
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
of Warcraft, for instance, because this was actually going on with the War Within here at Blizzard. So

78
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
yeah, like if you're in the US, look for Trolli products. Thankfully, we have a whole bunch of

79
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
bags here. So expect me to actually be eating these throughout the stream. We've had like seven bags

80
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
in the last two days. Yeah, as we've been like prepping for the stream, like this has been my

81
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
whole entire diet. Actually, no, I've been eating normal food. But at the same time, this is like

82
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
my kryptonite right here. So expect me to be eating these throughout the stream. It's my favorite stream

83
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,000
because we have snacks now. So I'm like, this is perfect. This is perfect. But one thing, again, we

84
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
wanted to mention, which is the release date. I think we have a release date map here. So yeah, as you guys

85
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
can see on October 7th in Irvine at 4pm Pacific, or Pacific time or California time, if you want to say it,

86
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,000
is when the actual expansion is going to be launching. This is a global launch. So everyone is coming out at

87
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
the same time. The world is round. So you can't get everyone in on October 8th. So that's why there's

88
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
some in on October 7th. But we wanted to make sure that we could get as many people in on October 8th.

89
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And of course, a little earlier on October 7th, but everyone's coming out at the exact same time. So

90
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,000
looking forward to everyone jumping in. We do have an action packed show today, a lot of stuff to cover.

91
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,000
We are going to be hitting up on the patch 2.0 PTR changes first, as first up in the agenda,

92
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:25,000
because we have so many things to share. I will note this is our 20th live stream for Diablo 4 that

93
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
we've ever done, which is really cool. And this is also our first time we're actually streaming on

94
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
TikTok. We already stream on X, we stream on Twitch, and we stream on YouTube. So this is kind of a nice

95
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
momentous occasion. But because of how much content we have, and how many guests we have,

96
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
we are going to say that we will have some small little breaks while we actually mic new people up,

97
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
bring them into the studio, and then swap them out for other things. But we are going to be talking

98
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
first about patch 2.0 PTR and the feedback that we actually received from players. And then separately,

99
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
we're also going to be talking about season six, season of Hatred Rising. And separately,

100
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
we will finish off the show with all the Vessel of Hatred features and going into a little bit

101
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
more of a deeper dive, something that you were talking about, Brent.

102
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh, yeah. Can't wait. I mean, we have so many people coming in that we're having to pack them in

103
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,000
rows.

104
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah, exactly. You're going to see multiple levels of people in the studio. So we're going to take a quick

105
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
break while we get the first group in for our patch 2.0 PTR feedback overview. So we'll see you in a bit.

106
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:23,000
We'll see you in a bit.

107
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Awesome. I appreciate everyone bearing with us as we get people mic'd up. We're going to

108
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
be doing this a couple times throughout this stream. But we're here to talk about the PTR

109
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,000
learnings from patch 2.0 PTR, which we had earlier this month. Super beneficial. PTRs have been great

110
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
for us since we've started actually hosting them for Diablo 4. And of course, this one was a very,

111
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
very big one because we have a lot of big changes coming with Vessel of Hatred in season six.

112
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But I know we want to jump right straight or jump straight into it. So Aislinn, I know you're going to start us off and talk about some progression changes.

113
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yes, I am. So let's, yeah, like you said, let's jump.

114
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Oh, you actually, before we do that. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I just realized no one knows who we are.

115
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh, yeah.

116
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I mean, there we go. I was just like, wait a minute. Of course, we have some familiar faces. But if you guys want to do quick intros.

117
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah. Hi, I'm Colin. I'm a lead designer.

118
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Hey, I'm Aislinn. I'm a systems designer.

119
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Hi, I'm Charles. I'm a class designer.

120
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Hey, y'all. I'm Anthony. I'm an associate class designer.

121
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Awesome. Great. There we go. Now we got everyone settled.

122
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Aislinn, do you want to talk about some of the progression changes?

123
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Yes, absolutely. So, Adam, like you said, the PTR has been just fantastic for us.

124
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's given us so much data and the feedback you guys give is just pivotal to us launching in the state we want to see the game in.

125
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And, you know, everyone wants to see the game in.

126
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And so, yeah, let's talk about it.

127
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let's talk about some changes we've made because of it.

128
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So, first of all, monster intensity.

129
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Something we saw in the early game was people weren't noticing the changes in monster intensity

130
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
because people were skipping through difficulties fairly quickly.

131
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And so we've decided to move monster intensity from scaling over normal, hard, expert, and penitent

132
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
to scaling over torment one through four because you're going to be progressing through torments a little bit slower.

133
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So you're going to be able to feel the intensity changes, I think, a little more potently.

134
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah, there's a bit more jumps, right?

135
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah, absolutely.

136
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
And again, the intensity system was essentially monsters just become a little bit more reliable in their damage.

137
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Right.

138
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
They start to predict your movement a little bit more on the projectiles.

139
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It's not a massive change, but it should sort of make the monsters feel a little bit more aggressive and dangerous.

140
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah, they just become a little more lethal, I think, ultimately, beyond, you know, numerical changes.

141
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Second up I want to talk about is one that I'm really, really happy and excited about, actually,

142
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
is that elites, unique elites, and super elites are three different types of elites you can actually fight,

143
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
if you know that or not.

144
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
That's a thing.

145
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And previously, they all did very different amounts of damage from one another.

146
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Like, for example, a super elite might deal actually two times the amount of damage of a normal elite.

147
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And what that was causing was when an elite spawned an affix, like lightning enchanted or poison or whatever,

148
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
the super elites would do two times more damage with those affixes.

149
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But you didn't really have any way to tell, right?

150
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
There was no way to tell if an affix was spawned by an elite or a super elite.

151
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And so kind of seemingly randomly, an affix might deal two times more damage to you out of nowhere.

152
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And so what we've done is we've normalized the damage that all of these different elite types actually deal,

153
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
so that when you do see the affixes that they're spewing out, you can expect the damage you're going to receive.

154
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Like, you know how much it's going to hit you for.

155
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It's one more consistent.

156
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Way more consistent, way more predictable, which is really helpful for not getting randomly one shot.

157
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah.

158
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Our fame loves those.

159
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And then finally on difficulty, we have some changes to standard difficulty tiers.

161
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
We know some of you guys are looking for a challenge, so let's take a look at what a challenge looks like.

162
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,000
All right.

163
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So we have a level one character here in Kyovishad going to the statue to change their difficulty.

164
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So what are they going to change it to?

165
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Well, before they could access normal hard and expert, but now they can access penitent at level one.

166
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
That's what we only play.

167
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah.

168
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Why would we play anything else?

169
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yes.

170
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So you have to beat the base campaign on your account once, and then you can go into penitent.

171
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
And let's see how that turns out for this person.

172
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh, yeah.

173
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm sure it's going great.

174
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Helltide.

175
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Just a few demons.

176
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Oh.

177
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
A few too many demons.

178
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Just a couple few too many demons.

179
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah.

180
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Mythic uniques.

181
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
So you can do penitent at level one now.

182
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's pretty hard, guys.

183
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So if you plan to go into level one, be prepared.

184
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But seriously, we know people really wanted to be able to push their builds as far as they could as early as they could.

185
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And now you can.

186
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
So whenever you feel like you're ready for penitent during your leveling journey, hop in there and see how you do.

187
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah.

188
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I know that was one of the biggest points of feedback we got during this PTR, which was like, hey, we'd like to see if penitent wasn't gated way further down the line and if it could be brought in.

189
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And so it's now available at level one.

190
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And, you know, as we've shown in the footage, it can be difficult.

191
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But I think what's nice is like if someone creates alts and they end up, you know, finding a bunch of mythic uniques and stuff, which you can use at earlier levels.

192
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah.

193
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You then can at least potentially start off in penitent a little bit earlier and, you know, stay with a higher difficulty in that type of way, which is nice.

194
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

195
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
We really want to embrace like the sort of choose your difficulty that we really liked with the mine cages in season five, four and five.

196
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And again, like to your point, alts just are able to speed run their way to max level, right, by playing at a really hard difficulty.

197
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Exactly.

198
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So it should feel a lot better.

199
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And it feels great to just hop into penitent early, like when you're capable of doing it.

200
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It does.

201
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's just awesome.

202
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah.

203
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We do.

204
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
We don't necessarily expect everyone to play at penitent.

205
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's really hard to play at your own risk.

206
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yes.

207
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Yeah.

208
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Your character needs to be pretty good.

209
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Yeah.

210
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah.

211
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,000
All right.

212
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Let's talk about some itemization changes.

213
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So we got a lot of feedback that once you got to max level and you were, you know, starting that ancestral grind, you were stuck with these non-ancestral items for a pretty long time.

214
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And we do like that.

215
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But we know that people want to see the journey for those non-ancestral items to be a little punchier.

216
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And so we've made some targeted changes here to ensure that non-ancestral legendaries have more, well, punch to them.

217
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So we've increased the amount of master working you can put on a non-ancestral legendary from four to eight.

218
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We are also allowing them to be tempered twice.

219
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Previously, both of those values were exclusive to ancestral items.

220
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
But now non-ancestrals can go up to that.

221
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Additionally, we saw that people were going to, like, the boss ladder or they were just finding uniques out in the world.

222
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And they didn't drop as, it didn't feel like they were dropping as ancestral as often as they should have.

223
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Right, because they're so rare.

224
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Right.

225
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
They're so rare.

226
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And, you know, you want finding a unique item to be an exciting moment.

227
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And so we've tripled the chance for them to drop as ancestral.

228
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And this should help a lot, especially during the boss ladder, you know, when you're killing these uber bosses and they're dropping lots of uniques.

229
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
A lot more of them are going to turn out to be ancestral.

230
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Definitely.

231
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And this should mean that once you're starting in around level 60, you have a lot more progression on your equipment that sort of bridges the gap to ancestral.

232
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
We also heard a lot of feedback that that second tempered affects really is what enables your build to come online.

233
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And that's what we're trying to do with the system of ancestral is that you can get your build online.

234
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah.

235
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But then there's still items that you can chase that just enhance that build.

236
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Right.

237
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And we saw that, like, not having that second tempered affects and not having those eight masterwork ranks really sort of hindered your ability to get that build online.

238
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Yeah.

239
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
To get into the fun and start blasting.

240
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah.

241
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
No, that's a great point.

242
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Because we don't want you to feel like you have to find ancestrals for your build to function.

243
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And, you know, this change is working towards making that true.

244
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Definitely.

245
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So you still have those items you can chase, but you can still get those endgame builds online pretty quickly.

246
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yep.

247
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:40,000
For sure.

248
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And finally on itemization, we are adding some scrolls of restoration to the season journey.

249
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
The scrolls of restoration are the scrolls of tempering that we talked about at Gamescom.

250
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You can use them to reset the tempering chances on an item.

251
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And we wanted to add these to the season journey so you could just have a couple of deterministic ways to acquire them and use them on your gear.

252
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And this, of course, is not the only place you can earn these scrolls of restoration.

253
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
No.

254
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You know, you can earn them throughout the world.

255
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
There's a small drop chance.

256
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And we'll be actually talking about another way of earning them later on as well.

257
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yeah.

258
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Definitely.

259
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yeah.

260
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So I think one thing that I'm excited about on the unique changes, if you equate greater Apexes in Season 5 to Ancestral, you're actually going to have a higher chance to get an Ancestral unique compared to getting a greater Apex on a unique than live.

261
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Right.

262
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Right.

263
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So it means that uniques are really exciting.

264
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
You might actually get, like, the Staff of Endless Rage, for example.

265
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Maybe you're not playing a Fireball sort, but now you're like, oh, well, I have an Ancestral version of this unique.

266
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That's huge.

267
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
That's pretty good.

268
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Yeah.

269
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So it really, like, kind of gets you to experiment a little bit more.

270
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And we really like that aspect about those uniques sometimes being a lot more powerful.

271
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Yeah.

272
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,000
No.

273
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's, we want that moment when you see a unique on the grounds to be really fun and exciting.

274
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And seeing it drop as an Ancestral with greater Apexes is about as exciting as it gets for a uniques.

275
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That's pretty cool.

276
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
All right.

277
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Let's talk about some player power changes based on PTR feedback.

278
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So I want to start by framing our goals for Torment difficulties.

279
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So Torment 1, we want all content to be available in the game.

280
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You can fight Lilith.

281
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
You can fight the Boss Latter.

282
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You can go to the Dark Citadel, you know, et cetera.

283
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
All these activities are available.

284
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Torment 4 is intended to be aspirational content.

285
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And what that means is you've already unlocked everything in the game when you enter Torment 1.

286
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:45,000
But Torment 4 is like the essence of Diablo, like build crafting, where you're just pushing your character as far as you can go.

287
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And Torment 4 exists for that purpose, for people who want to push their character as far as they can go.

288
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And with that said, and the reason why I'm saying this is because we were seeing that people were getting to Torment 4 way faster and way easier than we were hoping for in the PTR.

289
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And, you know, which is just another great, like, it's great that we did the PTR because we saw that.

290
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And with that all said, we've made some changes to kind of keep Torment 4 this, you know, really challenging and exciting thing to reach.

291
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
We've reverted the skill damage bonus from main stat back to what it was in Season 5.

292
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So we had actually doubled it in the PTR, but we found that that was just giving players too much power.

293
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Too much.

294
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So we sent it back.

295
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And we also pulled back on Legendary Glyph power a bit.

296
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Colin, do you want to talk about that?

297
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah, so we reduced the scaling on the glyphs quite a bit because we found that it was really devaluing a lot of the aspect rolls or rolls on your gear.

298
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Like when you're getting 2,000 additive damage from a glyph, it's really hard to actually feel anything on your gear through tempering or through those affects that are dropping.

299
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So essentially what we've done is pair that back.

300
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
We've redistributed it.

301
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
We'll cover that a little bit on where we put some of that power.

302
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But overall, we think this feels a lot better.

303
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Glyphs aren't just carrying, like, 80% of your power on a build.

304
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And it just feels a lot better so that it doesn't feel as sort of mandatory that I have to get all five glyphs and level them up to actually be pushing.

305
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It's a lot more about what are the aspects you have, what are the uniques you have, what are the nodes you're actually getting on the Paragon board.

306
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I think it feels a lot better.

307
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah, and, like, I think one of the important things to say about this is that, like, it's really awesome to get a tremendous amount of power from one source.

308
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:30,000
But because there are so many different sources of power in the game, if one source gives too much power, it makes the other sources feel kind of unimportant.

309
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And that's not fun.

310
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So we want to make sure that every source of power in the game is contributing to your build in very meaningful ways.

311
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And so this change is helping other sources of power feel really punchy.

312
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Definitely.

313
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yeah.

314
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Awesome.

315
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I know tons of changes here with player power, tons of changes with, like, progression, including difficulty.

316
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And itemization.

317
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Do we have anything else on progression?

318
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I think one thing I think that's really important to touch on is the torment goals here, right?

319
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yeah.

320
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Because it's a definite fundamental shift from Season 5 in that you think about World Tier 3 into World Tier 4, and you're sort of racing to get to World Tier 4 as fast as possible because that's where all the best items can drop.

321
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah.

322
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And we've sort of just changed that to Torment 1 is where all the best items can drop.

323
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It's where everything unlocks.

324
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
But essentially, Torment 2, 3, and 4 increase the odds of those things happening.

325
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So it's just efficiency, right?

326
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah.

327
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:34,000
We don't necessarily want to say you must get to Torment 4 to experience the game or to get the best drops in the game, similar to World Tier 4 in Season 5.

328
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It's a very different feeling.

329
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So we're excited to see how that plays out, and we want to sort of see what you all think as well.

330
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yeah.

331
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And just to reiterate, you know, all of the content, all of the best gear can be found in Torment 1.

332
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So if that's where your build feels most comfortable farming, that's great.

333
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
You can still achieve all your goals.

334
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
You can really max out your character there.

335
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It just, you get a reward for pushing this harder difficulty by more efficiency.

336
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Yeah.

337
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And that's like what affords Torment 4 the means to, or like the space to be really hard.

338
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Definitely.

339
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It's because you don't have to get there.

340
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
And so it can be really, really challenging.

341
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And, you know, some players really love that, and that's awesome.

342
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Definitely.

343
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Awesome.

344
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Well, I know the next topic we want to talk about is some of the big system changes that are actually coming with Vessel of Hatred,

345
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and also changes that we're applying post-PTR from things that we actually learned.

346
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Colin, you want to walk us through and start us off with some of the Paragon stuff?

347
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, absolutely.

348
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So, again, we got a ton of feedback from the PTR, and we took a look at Paragon.

349
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:44,000
That was one of the bigger changes that we made where we capped the boards because we feel like that gives us a lot more space to increase the power of each of these boards

350
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and make the choice more about what is the board you're looking for.

351
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So what we've done here is we've added a bunch of normal nodes.

352
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So those are things like stats that empower those glyphs to upgrade that legendary glyph radius.

353
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
We added them.

354
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It was kind of sad.

355
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Like there weren't actually a lot of nodes to flesh it out and sort of build up that Paragon, that extra glyph range that you're going to get from upgrading it to legendary.

356
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So we've done that.

357
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
We added around 8 to every board, and then the starting board, I think we went to like 12 or something like that,

358
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
just because, you know, the starting board should feel really good with that first glyph.

359
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
The next thing we've done is we've taken a look at a lot of the rare and magic nodes, and we've just made them generically more useful.

360
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So you think about like two-handed bludgeoning damage on the Barbarian.

361
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
It's like, okay, like I guess I can only benefit if I'm doing this one very specific thing.

362
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And we've just opened that up to say damage, right?

363
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That's going to scale everything across your character as opposed to like while you're doing this sort of obscure thing.

364
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So we think that feels a lot better.

365
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
We've also just sort of taken a look at what are the affixes we're giving, like fucking potion healing.

366
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Like I know you're all going to be really sad.

367
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
That was my favorite stuff.

368
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I know you're all super sad to see if we've taken potion healing out.

369
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
But we've just changed it to healing received.

370
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
We've also just taken a look at things like damage reduction from dots and made it damage reduction.

371
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
So it should be a lot more generically useful, and this board should feel a lot more punchy and open-ended, which we really like.

372
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And that's sort of doubling down on the spirit of what we've done with season four atomization, right?

373
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Just sort of taking back some of these conditional things that aren't necessarily adding a ton of value to your build identity.

374
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You're just opening things up.

375
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And then the next thing we've done is we talked about redistributing some of the power on those glyphs.

376
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And we've taken a look at all of our nodes, all of magic and rare nodes, and we've just buffed all of them.

377
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So we've doubled all the additive bonuses on rare and magic nodes.

378
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
We've increased the damage reduction values by about 1.5x.

379
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So they should feel a lot more chunky.

380
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And as you're journeying through Paragon, right, it should feel like you have more options than to just bum rush every glyph socket and every legendary node.

381
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,000
There should be some pretty punchy, like, damage sources that you can get, damage reduction sources you can get.

382
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We've also done things like all the resistance nodes you have on the Paragon board actually give max resistance as well now.

383
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So it's pretty powerful.

384
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah.

385
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
We've done a lot of changes there.

386
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
So this is one of the first steps we're taking to really improve the Paragon system.

387
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
With the new sort of philosophy of, like, we want you to pick what boards you want.

388
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And we expect to be updating more in the future.

389
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

390
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And I think that this harkens back to what we were just saying, which is that, you know, it's really fun for all of your sources of power to be meaningful.

391
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And so we're basically just taking, like, the tons and tons of power that was in glyphs and kind of slightly redistributing it to Paragon.

392
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
So going through your Paragon board is just more interesting and fun.

393
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Definitely.

394
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Cool.

395
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Next up, we got, I think, Infernal Hordes.

396
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yes.

397
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah.

398
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So if you remember, Infernal Hordes was under construction during the PTR as we were fitting in, like, how does this going to work with the greater equipment chest, turning it into ancestral items.

399
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And there are three things that we really wanted to tackle as a part of this release, right?

400
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Infernal Hordes is an eternal game mode.

401
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
So we wanted to take the learnings we got from Season 5 and apply it to this next update.

402
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
So one of the things we saw was that loot was just dominating the reward landscape here.

403
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Like, getting 200 legendaries from one source of activity is cool for Season 5 and it's the brand new activity for Season 5.

404
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
That's awesome.

405
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But we wanted to just readjust it, refit it back in.

406
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
We still have the Codex of Power that lets you store all these legendary powers.

407
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So we felt like we wanted to take more of a quality over quantity approach here.

408
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And one of the things that was sort of frustrating about that quality miss was that you didn't really have a way to reliably target those unique items that were coming out of Infernal Hordes.

409
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
If you think about it, you had to open a chest and just hope that you were going to get one of the unique items out of this chest.

410
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And that sort of led to a frustrating and tedious reward flow where you're just constantly opening up these 28th of chests over and over and over.

411
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I know I've spent probably more time opening the material chest than actually...

412
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I mean, I think that's everyone's favorite pastime of just running around the material chest.

413
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah, with the tool down on the chest like, oh my god, just give me my fucking shit.

414
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
So it takes forever.

415
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So we've taken a look at how we're going to actually deliver these keys.

416
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
We've taken them out of the crafting system, but they're not too rare.

417
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
They're just uncommonly found throughout the world.

418
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
We want this to be like an oh shit moment when the key drops just because you're going to get a ton of XP from killing the hordes.

419
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You're going to get a ton of materials and a ton of items as well.

420
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
So we think that will make the keys feel a lot more interesting and it's not going to blow your inventory as much.

421
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah.

422
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
You really want to use them when you get them.

423
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So the next part here is if we could go back to the slide.

424
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Oh, if we could go to Infernal Hordes.

425
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Back to Infernal Hordes.

426
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,000
There we go.

427
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:40,000
The council boss, no matter what, as long as you kill that council, they're going to drop dungeon boss loot, which is going to be legendaries, crafting materials, gold, etc.

428
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
on top of the Infernal Horde unique items.

429
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And that's going to scale with torment.

430
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
So guaranteed every single time you kill that council, you are going to get unique items that are specific to Infernal Hordes.

431
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That's great because those Infernal Horde uniques are pretty sick.

432
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Definitely.

433
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So no more waiting at the chest to get that drop.

434
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It's just going to happen and it feels a lot more like a boss ladder where it's like, okay, I want to get Infernal Horde unique items.

435
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm going to be able to reliably get those and get a pull at the sort of slot machine there.

436
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And then the next thing here is we've updated the chest.

437
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So the chest of greater equipment are going to drop the scrolls of restoration or re-tempering.

438
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
So you're going to be able to get them reliably from the Infernal Hordes, not just the Dark Citadel.

439
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And that should feel pretty meaty and good.

440
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And then we've also guaranteed some amount of ancestral items from that greater equipment chest.

441
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And ancestral items are very much more coveted than just greater ethics items.

442
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
So that should feel pretty meaty.

443
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And then the chest of materials is now just going to convert all your Aether into materials.

444
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You don't have to constantly open the chest.

445
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Turn it into a bunch of master working materials, gems.

446
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It should feel a lot more snappy and less time looting, more time playing.

447
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And the gold chest is the same.

448
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Yeah, because it just gives you a bunch.

449
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Next up, I know we have the reward stuff.

450
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
We kind of spoiled your...

451
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So we can just skip this.

452
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yeah, so rewards.

453
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
This is just a bunch of miscellaneous tuning and making the game feel better and more rewarding.

454
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So we've significantly increased the ancestral drop rate from Nightmare Dungeons and Whispers.

455
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Thank you to the person who ran a thousand Nightmare Dungeons and Whispers.

456
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Yeah, that's right.

457
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
PTRs.

458
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Yeah.

459
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Oh my god.

460
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Definitely fixed the problem there.

461
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And that should feel a lot more rewarding.

462
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
We've also added just experience to the Nightmare Dungeon completion, which just feels better as you're grinding that Paragon.

463
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Also while you're leveling up, it's like a pretty good hit of XP.

464
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And then we've also done miscellaneous buffs to just miscellaneous things.

465
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So Hellborn will drop loot.

466
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Butcher is going to drop a guaranteed axe, I believe, of Butcher's Axe.

467
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
The world boss, Treasure Goblins, those are all going to drop a lot better loot.

468
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
It's also going to scale with Torment, which would feel good.

469
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah, I mean, it makes sense for these, like, I guess the Hellborn's not exactly a random encounter.

470
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
It's the world boss, but like the Butcher and the Treasure Goblin, these big meaty encounters.

471
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It makes sense for these to occur and you're like, give me good loot because this is uncommon.

472
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
This doesn't happen that frequently.

473
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I want it to be amazing.

474
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It's an exciting moment and the loot should reflect that.

475
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yeah.

476
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I love that loot explosion.

477
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Yeah.

478
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Treasure Goblin.

479
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah.

480
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Nothing beats finding a Treasure Goblin at level 5.

481
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Yeah.

482
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Just chasing it around using your basic attack.

483
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Yeah, and it guarantee drops Legendary no matter what level you are.

484
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

485
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It should feel pretty good.

486
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The next thing here is we really love how players or how you all have sort of embraced the Stronghold experience bonus.

487
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
We've actually just done that across the game.

488
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So campaign feels really good in terms of experience granted.

489
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Side quest should feel really good, especially in Nihon 2.

490
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
But what we saw with the Stronghold experience in the PTR is that two levels felt a little bit aggressive

491
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
and like sort of forced you to do Strongholds over and over and over.

492
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
We've just paired that back down to 1.25 levels, which is still really meaty.

493
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Like you're getting an entire level from doing these.

494
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Oh, yeah.

495
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's really fulfilling what we had hoped Strongholds were going to provide, which is an alternative means to level.

496
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
If you want to ride around the open world and do a bunch of Strongholds, that's absolutely a viable way to level up now.

497
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,000
We think that like all the quest content in general just feels a lot better because they're a lot more generous there.

498
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
The other change I'll note here is that a bulk of that experience is going to be from killing the boss, and it's a first-time reward.

499
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So that means you're not going to be able to sort of, you know, cheese running Strongholds over and over and over.

500
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Thank you, Rax, for showing that with your friends from your chat that did that in 20 minutes.

501
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It was a good video.

502
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I mean, in all fairness.

503
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Cool.

504
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And then the next one here is we heard a ton of feedback that rare and magic items just felt like they're adding a lot of noise to Torment.

505
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
We're dropping a lot more of them.

506
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Now they just get auto-savaged in Torment.

507
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Hooray.

508
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Get them out of here.

509
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Yeah, get them out.

510
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And then the next one is just a nice quality of life.

511
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
The Paragon Glyphs now drop from the pit.

512
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So when you're doing a bunch of pit runs, you're also going to be getting glyphs.

513
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
It just means you don't really have to like go out and do other things if you have a bunch of keys for the pit.

514
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah, I mean, that's really nice, too, because, you know, theoretically you could enter the pit and not actually have a glyph.

515
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
But now you will.

516
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
So you can find one to level up if that's what happens.

517
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Awesome.

518
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And I know, last but not least, we have kind of itemization.

519
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
This is some big stuff here that I know will excite players for sure.

520
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Yeah.

521
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So one of the things we've heard a ton from the player base and you all is that I wish I could make a Mythic Unique deterministically.

522
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
If I do everything in a season, if I kill Uber Lilith, if I do the season's journey, I want to be able to get a Mythic Unique.

523
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And we saw this as an opportunity to essentially create an identity between the runecrafting of Mythic Uniques and the blacksmith.

524
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
We moved it from the alchemist to the blacksmith.

525
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
The blacksmith version of crafting Mythic Uniques.

526
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So now what you're going to be able to do is you're going to be able to take two Resplendent Sparks to the blacksmith and get a random Mythic Unique.

527
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
That means no matter what, as long as you do everything in the season, you're going to get a Mythic Unique.

528
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And if you take those Resplendent Sparks and you decide, I really want a specific Mythic Unique, you'll be able to take a set of runes and actually pick which one.

529
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Right.

530
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And what that does is the runes are a lot more flexible.

531
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
They can be traded.

532
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
You can also get some incremental progress, right, because they drop a lot more frequently than Mythic Unique or Sparks in general.

533
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So what this means is you now have two really clear means to sort of target Mythic Uniques.

534
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And, you know, you now have a guaranteed way to make a Mythic Unique at the end of a season, which we think will feel really good.

535
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Something that's kind of cool about that is that it gives runes this, like, intrinsic trade value, which I kind of love.

536
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Yeah.

537
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Like, they have this big purpose towards crafting one of the best items in the game, which is really cool.

538
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I finally can get my Starless Skies.

539
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah.

540
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Cool.

541
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And then the next one here is you're going to be getting a lot of salvage in Torment because everything is getting auto-salvaged.

542
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
So we figured, you know what, we should probably give you some purpose and value to that salvage.

543
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And now you can take it to the blacksmith and forge random legendary equipment at the blacksmith.

544
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yeah, this is huge.

545
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I love this change.

546
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And it also has a chance to be unique or Mythic and sometimes ancestral.

547
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So it's definitely a great place to dump all that salvage, excess salvage that you have.

548
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And then the next one here is more just sort of a quality of life and nicety.

549
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
We added runes and we're putting way more sockets on gear.

550
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah.

551
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
We just allowed you to add sockets to gear with just the general salvage material.

552
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
You don't need scattered prisms anymore.

553
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Scattered prisms are required for ancestral items.

554
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
And that just essentially means, you know, ah, missing a socket, you can pretty easily add one.

555
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And then the next one here is mostly quality of life for alt characters, but the jeweler no longer has a level requirement to engage with the jeweler.

556
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Previously on the PTR, you had to, like, trade gear to your main character, add a socket.

557
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
It was super tedious and we just made it not like that.

558
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Awesome.

559
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So tons of big changes coming across a multitude of systems within D4.

560
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Thanks to a lot of great feedback that we got from all the players within the community, content creators, etc.

561
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So thank you guys so much for that.

562
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Thank you, Colin, for walking us through that.

563
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Next up, we want to talk about some of the class changes and everything.

564
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
And so Charles here is going to walk us through it.

565
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Yeah, I'd love to talk about some of the class changes that we saw in the PTR.

566
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Once again, I wanted to thank all of the players who, you know, gave a lot of detail, detailed feedback, a lot of data on, you know, how classes were performing, all the different builds and the new items, new effects and all that kind of stuff, new skills.

567
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It's been really helpful in helping to make sure that we make all our class designs as fun and engaging as possible.

568
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I do want to say that, you know, this patch is huge.

569
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
There's lots of changes, you know, as I said, a lot of new class stuff, but a lot of new system stuff across the whole game.

570
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
And so we do expect some level of, like, volatility here.

571
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And, you know, when a lot of things change, there's a lot of unknowns.

572
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And so that's just the mindset we're approaching this patch with.

573
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And what we're going to talk about here is not a complete detailed list of everything that we've changed from the PTR to live.

574
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It's just kind of some samples and kind of talking through our learnings and what we saw on the class design team and what we're thinking about.

575
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And so make sure you check out the full patch notes once we're done with the stream.

576
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And also if you, a lot of the changes came in the PTR initially.

577
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So definitely check out those if you're unfamiliar because there's tons of class changes there as well.

578
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Oh, yeah.

579
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
So starting with the Barbarian, we generally saw that Barbarian class was a little bit too weak on the PTR.

580
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
And I think even on Season 5, I think it's just generally considered a little too weak.

581
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Historically, though, it's been one of our stronger classes.

582
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
But, you know, in recent seasons, it's fallen a little bit on harder times.

583
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So a lot of our focus here is buffs to some underutilized skills and legendaries and uniques.

584
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So we've got updates to upheaval to make it just a little bit more punchy, hits a little bit harder.

585
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:56,000
We've got updates to some of the uniques that talk to other core skills like Hammer of the Ancients and Double Swing to give them a little bit more damage boost as well.

586
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And finally, there's a buff to the Martial Vigor passive.

587
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That is a passive in the skill tree that gives you some damage reduction from elite enemies, including bosses.

588
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And it might seem pretty small on paper.

589
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
It's just 4% to 6%.

590
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But for every skill rank you have in that, you get that much more.

591
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And really, when you're fighting the late-game tormented bosses and high torment tiers, it's going to be a pretty noticeable amount of survivability against those boss fights for Barbarians.

592
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Yeah, those passive skills add up really quickly when you start getting a bunch of ranks in them and stuff.

593
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So, for sure.

594
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Absolutely.

595
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Moving on to the Druid.

596
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We also think the Druid was a little bit on the weaker end of the classes.

597
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I think there was a few bugs on the PTR that we're addressing as we go live,

598
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:45,000
where some of their effects, specifically in the Paragon and some of the key passives, weren't quite working exactly how we intended.

599
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So they might have been a little bit weaker due to that on the PTR specifically.

600
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So we're definitely addressing those.

601
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I also wanted to talk about Nature's Fury.

602
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:03,000
This is a key passive that whenever you cast an Earth or Storm skill, there's a chance to cast the same skill of the opposite type.

603
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And this was causing some unintended interactions with one of the unique items, the Earthbreaker ring,

604
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
that ended up proccing or triggering Nature's Fury way more often than we intended.

605
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That's because we have this concept of casts where you actually need to press the button and then, hey, you did one cast.

606
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,000
And whenever we do something like auto casts, which is like, hey, I triggered a free skill with Nature's Fury,

607
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
that shouldn't kind of recursively trigger or trigger the other effects that are looking for casts.

608
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
But in that particular interaction it was.

609
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And so we've fixed that interaction, but then thrown some pretty big buffs to those items and the things affected in that build.

610
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,000
We still expect those kind of things, especially landslide builds that use this a lot, to still be very powerful builds going forward.

611
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But we just didn't want that one particular unintended interaction to be happening.

612
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And that kind of overshines, you know, all the builds, right?

613
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Yeah.

614
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
When you have like one build that's, you know, crazy over, you know, the top.

615
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Exactly. Yeah.

616
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Especially whenever there's one build that's so dominant that it really makes it feel like, hey, I'm playing the class wrong if I'm not doing this.

617
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And that's not something that we want.

618
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:21,000
We want you to be able to play all the different ways of playing the classes and feel like it's a valid and viable choice to compete or to complete the game.

619
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Some of the other changes on Druid as well.

620
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
We've got some updates to Great Staff of the Crone.

621
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
This is one of my favorite items that lets your Claw and Stormstrike build kind of synergize really nicely.

622
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
We've got just a lot more damage on Werewolf skills through the Lust for Carnage Paragon node.

623
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Basically the same functionality, but just added 50% bonus damage there.

624
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
We saw Werewolf was particularly falling behind.

625
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And an update to the Untamed Legendary Paragon node.

626
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
This is the new one that talks to companion skills.

627
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Previously it just gave skill ranks, which kind of fell off as you got a lot of skill ranks.

628
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Now it's just multiplicative damage, and I'm really looking forward to seeing some companion Druids in the new season, especially with the new key passive.

629
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
All right, moving on to the Necromancer.

630
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:13,000
So the Necromancer is a class that I think we saw a lot of variety for like Blood, Bone, and Shadow builds.

631
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
A lot of those were competing very well.

632
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
But a Necromancer is really all about minions, right?

633
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And unfortunately we saw minion builds really falling behind from where we want.

634
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And we know that minion builds are like the most appealing part of a Necromancer.

635
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And so on the class design team, we're really committed to making sure that minion Necromancer is good.

636
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And we're going to see some massive buffs to this patch.

637
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And we're going to continue monitoring to make sure that the minion fantasy is really a powerful and compelling one.

638
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
We also saw that Necromancer was one of the squishier classes.

639
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It had a little bit less defensive oomph than we really wanted.

640
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And so we've made some updates here to Reap.

641
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's going to give a little bit longer damage reduction.

642
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Just makes that a little bit more usable for that function.

643
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Same with Necrotic Fortitude.

644
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Gives a little bit more barrier.

645
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
This is kind of a passive barrier generation.

646
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So just a little bit more survivability in that late game.

647
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And then the rest of it here is just talking about minion buffs, right?

648
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
We've got Kaylin's Edict, the key passive.

649
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
This is going to...

650
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Previously it just gave you attack speed for your minions.

651
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Now it's also going to give you bonus multiplicative damage for all your minions.

652
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
A bunch of the legendaries and uniques that talked to minions, like Ring of Mendeln and Shade Mist,

653
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
that damage is now properly attributed to your minions rather than the Necromancer themselves.

654
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Which means if you have bonus golem damage, for instance, and your golem triggers Ring of Mendeln,

655
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
it's now going to benefit properly and it's going to be multiplied up by those multipliers.

656
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
So pretty big buffs for those legendaries and uniques.

657
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Yeah, that's a lot of power for sure.

658
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Oh, absolutely.

659
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
So moving on, we've got...

660
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Next class we'll talk about the Rogue.

661
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I think the Rogue in general was performing pretty well across the board in the PTR.

662
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I think we got a lot of positive feedback.

663
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Like, hey, yeah, Rogue feels great.

664
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Like, just, you know...

665
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Spin the win.

666
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Yes, Spin the win.

667
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
The Dance of Knives skill in particular.

668
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
It's awesome.

669
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Yeah, I was really happy with where Dance of Knives landed as the new skill.

670
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It found a lot of use in a variety of builds and people have a lot of fun playing with it.

671
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:18,000
We did notice a little bit of the melee focus builds with Flurry and Twisting Blades falling behind just a little bit.

672
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:25,000
So a few of our changes here are focused on enhancing the legendaries that talk to those two, encircling blades and blade dancers.

673
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:33,000
In terms of key passives, we saw Victimize did have a bug that caused its damage scaling to be higher than intended.

674
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
And so we have fixed that math calculation on how it kind of scales damage based on other damage.

675
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Because it was really just a little bit too dominant.

676
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And now we think with this update, it'll still be a competitive choice, but it won't completely outshine every other key passive on the Rogue.

677
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And some nice little buffs here to Reign of Arrows, just to make it work a little bit better with Imbuement skills.

678
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Love me some Reign of Arrows.

679
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
It's a very flashy skill, especially with all those colors with the Imbuements on it.

680
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,000
All right.

681
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And finally, the Sorcerer.

682
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
The Sorcerer was definitely the strongest class, I think, we saw on the PTR.

683
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
By a fair margin.

684
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Just a little bit, you know?

685
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It was quite strong.

686
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
People were having a lot of fun with Sorcerer builds, especially with the new key passive Enlightenment.

687
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And Enlightenment had an issue where it's all about alternating skill casts.

688
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So, okay, you cast a Fire skill, you cast a Lightning skill, you cast a Cold skill, and you get these stacks really quickly.

689
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Unfortunately, it was stacking up unintentionally from some of those autocasts that we were talking about earlier with Nature's Fury.

690
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Where, when you trigger bonus casts from, like, Unstable Currents, it was actually ramping up the Enlightenment way too fast.

691
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And so we fixed that interaction, but we think, despite that, Enlightenment is still one of the strongest key passives of the sort.

692
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh, yeah.

693
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Yeah.

694
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:59,000
So it just brings it down a little bit, but we still think this is going to be a really powerful and compelling new key passive to play with once we go live.

695
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Two other changes here with the Flame Scar and Oculus uniques.

696
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:11,000
This is kind of adding in this chance to deal double damage affixes for Incinerate and Teleport, respectively.

697
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:22,000
This harkens back to what I talked about on the PTR stream, where we're adding these multiplicative damage bonuses into tempering for weapons.

698
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And, of course, we can't temper onto unique items, but for a lot of the unique items that are about very specific skills, such as Flame Scar and Oculus,

699
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:43,000
we've taken a pass to add in some of these affixes that enhance those skills in multiplicative ways to really make sure that, you know, Incinerate gets the same benefit from using that unique,

700
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
as opposed to just a Legendary that you would temper this affix onto anyway.

701
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It's a massive buff.

702
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Yes, absolutely.

703
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Incinerate size is like, I'd like pull out a ruler, like, is it actually...

704
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Yeah, actually.

705
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Is it working?

706
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Yeah, Incinerate size and Teleport size may be not the most compelling affix.

707
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Now you just get some of this multiplicative damage.

708
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
If somebody wants to make an Oculus build where most of the damage comes from Teleport, that's going to be awesome.

709
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
We'll see if you can manage to make that work.

710
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Yeah, I love that idea.

711
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Oh, my God.

712
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I already have a build page saved.

713
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I'll have to see that.

714
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Nice.

715
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So, yeah, once again, I just wanted to, you know, thank everyone for all the great feedback.

716
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:29,000
We on the class design team in particular are always reading and listening to feedback on, you know, how you're playing the classes,

717
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
what builds you're finding fun, what things are over or underpowered.

718
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
We listen to it.

719
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
We read your feedback.

720
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
We watch the videos that you make.

721
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
We really appreciate all of it.

722
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
And it really helps us to make the game as best as possible.

723
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Awesome.

724
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Thank you so much, Charles, for walking us through all the changes coming for class design.

725
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
It's actually not all the changes that we saw right here.

726
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
As Charles mentioned, we do have patch notes actually going live after this stream.

727
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And I will caveat, you will see 2.0.1 patch notes and you'll see 2.0.2 patch notes.

728
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
So there's 2.0.2 and 2.0.1.

729
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
2.0.2 is actually not on, like, people's PCs yet.

730
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
You haven't preloaded that.

731
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,000
That is going to be the last update you'll need to grab before we jump into launch for Vessel of Hatred.

732
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
But you will get all the patch notes after the stream.

733
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:24,000
So you can dig through all the class changes that we didn't cover and all the ins and outs of ins between now and what we have for PTR.

734
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
So last but not least, we have RuneWords.

735
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So I think we're going to jump straight into it.

736
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
So, Anthony, you want to go ahead?

737
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah, absolutely.

738
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
So, again, awesome feedback.

739
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
We got lots of different things that came in.

740
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:47,000
And we've heard multiple times a couple different things with the RuneWords that really just people kept repeating over and over again,

741
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
really mostly stemming down to two major issues with the whole system.

742
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And so previously, on the PTR, we had the legendary runes that were a lot stronger, you know,

743
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,000
because you want to reach that point eventually to where you get the powerful runes and then you play the game that way.

744
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Well, that was kind of outshining a lot of the other possibilities and, like, the idea that we had with the runes,

745
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
where you're mixing and matching, creating different combinations.

746
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,000
So what we are ending up doing now is we are taking that top end and we're going to bring it down.

747
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And then on the flip side, the second thing that we heard a lot of is those bottom runes.

748
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I don't want to say bottom runes.

749
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
The magic in rare runes that you find a little earlier,

750
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
especially those runes of ritual where you are, those are the ones where you're actually, like,

751
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:45,000
doing things to gain offering to then invoke those runes of invocation, those powers that you have.

752
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Those were intentionally a bit lower so that you have some progress,

753
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
but it felt like when you get them, it wasn't enough.

754
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,000
You didn't get to really feel those runes happen and pop off when you get them.

755
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So on the other side, we are taking that bottom end and bringing it up.

756
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
So together, we're kind of, I don't want to say flattening out,

757
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:16,000
but we are making it a lot more options for the players to really have choices throughout your whole journey

758
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
rather than just a linear, you know, get the stronger one and then obviously it's stronger.

759
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And what this will also do and the focus on this is to also make those utility runes really, really potent

760
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
and really pop off and a lot more visual things to happen.

761
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
And then finally, we removed a couple runes that weren't quite meeting our expectations.

762
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We have this thing that we say every once in a while, which is, like, condense the fun.

763
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:48,000
And we want to make that, you know, like the ideal situation where we have, you know,

764
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
the runes that we have are the ones that are cool and fun and not, like, overbloated with just a bunch of things

765
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
that don't, you know, don't always, like, meet those expectations.

766
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah, we want you to have lots of options and we don't want individual runes or effects to really overshadow everything else.

767
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
But that does mean that, you know, we want to make sure that all the options are really compelling.

768
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,000
And so ones that aren't meeting our bar, we just would rather take them out rather than leave them in.

769
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Yeah, absolutely.

770
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I think we're always going to be adding to the rune system.

771
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Of course.

772
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
So we want to leave ourselves the space.

773
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
We didn't want to water down the pool with things like the lightning bolt effect rune.

774
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
It's like that didn't really have, it was an evolutionary dead end.

775
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
We didn't necessarily have any way to juice that up.

776
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
So we want one of rune drops for it to feel like, oh, there's this new toy I can play with, right?

777
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It's important that every choice in the rune system is meaningful.

778
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Like every possible rune you can take or combination, like there's something there, right?

779
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Yeah, you want to feel it for sure.

780
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And it doesn't want to be something that, you know, you just like, oh, I got this rune.

781
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And it's like, well, let me find another one.

782
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
All right.

783
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
So here's some examples of some of the big outliers.

784
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
We heard lots, lots of feedback around these two especially.

785
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
That war cry rune.

786
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
So while it was giving berserking to everyone, it was a big power bonus.

787
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And so we're going to bring that down a little bit by just, it's no longer going to give that enhanced version.

788
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
It's just the baseline version.

789
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So it no longer gives berserking to all players.

790
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
That does mean it still works for barbarians because that is their skill.

791
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
They should still be able to gain that power as they would expect.

792
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And then down with the yam, which is that druid petrify.

793
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
The rune itself is not changing.

794
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:36,000
What's actually changing is on druids themselves, their ultimate there is no longer going to give that critical bonus baseline.

795
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's not going to be the enhanced version.

796
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
So if you want that as a druid, you can still get that big, powerful critical damage bonus.

797
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:50,000
But now that baseline is going to be that big stun, that big AOE moment that you see everything on the screen freeze.

798
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
And also just juice you up with a bunch of resource.

799
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And this is general class resource.

800
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So unlike what it'll say for the druid is it says their spirit goes up.

801
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
On the rune, it says it is your resource.

802
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
So everyone gets this huge, big moment where you can kind of reset.

803
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
So if I'm a sorcerer, it doesn't generate spirit.

804
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:11,000
It generates mana.

805
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Yes.

806
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
You don't just get a second bubble that fills up the spirit.

807
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
That would be weird.

808
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I like that this puts a lot more emphasis on the utility of runes, which is sort of what we had been originally intending.

809
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Not every choice is going to be a multiplicative damage source.

810
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
So you should have a lot more options.

811
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
It's more focused on utility.

812
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Yeah, absolutely.

813
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And stealing other classes' power.

814
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Yeah, obviously multiplicative damage is probably the single strongest thing you can do in an ARPG.

815
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And just when we noticed these ones were really those ones that are overshadowing every other option, we still think those will find a great niche for the builds that want it.

816
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
But they won't be the only choice that no one else can use anything else for.

817
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Absolutely, absolutely.

818
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:55,000
All right.

819
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So here's some examples.

820
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Again, I want to preface, this is not all of them.

821
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
There are a bunch of changes.

822
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
You guys will see them in the patch notes as we had already talked about.

823
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
But some of the big ones that I wanted to show off here.

824
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
So the spirit-born vortex, that's the one that pulls everyone in.

825
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
You group everything together.

826
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
That is going to be almost, you're going to be able to get that almost twice as often as it was before.

827
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:31,000
So you combine that in with something that, you know, has some grindy damage in the middle and you're going to be just having this pop off all the time.

828
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
As well as, so we call them subpowers.

829
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Those are things like the sorcerer meteorites or like the barbarian earthquakes.

830
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Those things that happen based on other things, but they create like another power that comes out.

831
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
We are juicing those up a lot more.

832
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:56,000
So these should be some of the most powerful versions of these subpowers in the game from these runes.

833
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And as you can see here, meteorites is jumping up a whole bunch as well as the offering cost is going down.

834
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
So you're going to be able to summon a lot more of these as well.

835
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And then one of the other things I saw feedback was around the say rune.

836
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I don't know exactly how to say it myself.

837
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I'll have to ask you even about that after this.

838
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:32,000
But where you summon spirit wolves and they didn't feel as impactful because their AI was not as poppy as like say the necromancers minions running around a lot more quickly.

839
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So we adjusted that and so we're going to have a video coming up here in a second and we can see.

840
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So now you're going to summon those wolves.

841
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
They're going to pop up and do their attack.

842
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And if you jump to the next pack, they're going to jump forward.

843
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Except this is going to happen a lot more frequently than before.

844
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:59,000
So now if you say fight that pack, jump to the next one, every time those wolves are going to just keep jumping and keep leaping.

845
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And this works in ranged as well.

846
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:09,000
So if you're fighting some enemy over here to the left and you attack them, your wolves are going to jump immediately over there.

847
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And then if you switch to this other group on the right, those wolves are going to jump across the screen because we've also increased that aggro range as well for that.

848
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Yeah, they feel a lot more responsive.

849
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
And like even in that clip, we saw them jump into the pack at basically the same time we did.

850
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
They are right there with you.

851
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
They're not lagging behind.

852
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And that's always like the worst feeling when like, hey, some of this thing, where are they?

853
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
What are they doing?

854
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
They're like they're a mile away.

855
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
No longer lazy dogs.

856
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

857
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
They were tired.

858
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
They were tired.

859
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Tired little pups, you know.

860
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And then here are some examples of those Rins of Ritual.

861
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Again, those are the ones that are generating this offering.

862
01:24:46,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And so these are mostly going to be changes to those magic and rare runes where we've taken that offering they give and we've really knocked it up to be a lot closer to where those legendary versions of these are.

863
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And that should hopefully give us a lot more options when it comes to deciding which combination of which runes that we are using.

864
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It also just means things are a lot more reliable.

865
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Like you're actually getting procs way more often with these buffs.

866
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Yeah, you actually get to see the fun happen, right?

867
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
See those effects happen a little bit more often.

868
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Yeah, so tons of rune changes that are coming.

869
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And as Anthony had mentioned, there's way more details in the actual patch notes themselves.

870
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
So people can check that out after the stream.

871
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Along with all the class changes, the system changes, the progression changes.

872
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It's all detailed out there for players specifically.

873
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
You know, I had one thing because I think we might have forgotten it.

874
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And, you know, I'm very concerned about monitor violence.

875
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Oh, yes.

876
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,000
We heard a lot of people were wanting to punch and punch their monitors.

877
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Oh, that's right.

878
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Yes.

879
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
When you get a greater affects on impairment resistance.

880
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Oh, yeah.

881
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,000
As monitor enthusiasts, we've just removed that from the affects pool.

882
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Yes.

883
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
So please don't.

884
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Please don't.

885
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Less punching of monitors.

886
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Save the monitors, please.

887
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And one thing I do want to call out on RuneWords, but actually, funny enough, we got a lot of feedback about players saying, like, hey, we noticed, like, different art on some of the classic runes that they may have seen from, like, back in D2.

888
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
That art has been updated to match what you saw in D2.

889
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,000
So.

890
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Harkins fast.

891
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Yes.

892
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,000
That's cool.

893
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Yeah.

894
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Shout out to the history of runes there for everyone.

895
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
So thank you guys for jumping into this.

896
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And I will say, like, this team is going to be staying vigilant through the launch of Vessel of Hatred with our Live Ops teams here.

897
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Shout out to our Live Ops team who will be helping us out through multitudes of patches, hot fixes.

898
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
We're going to be paying attention to the community and hearing all the feedback that players have.

899
01:26:51,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And we'll be jumping on a lot of the big things that we do notice and we do want to jump, like, kind of address earlier on, especially right after launch.

900
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So our cadence is going to be quick.

901
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
So do expect that.

902
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
We'll be posting all notes, all hot fix notes, et cetera, whenever they do come up.

903
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
So thank you guys again for joining us today to talk about the PTR learnings.

904
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Next up, we actually are going to start talking about the next season coming to Diablo 4, which is Season 6.

905
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And that will actually start with the launch of Vessel of Hatred.

906
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
We're going to do another quick mic swap musical chairs thing.

907
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Maybe we turn on Benny Hill music or something like that.

908
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
But we'll be right back here with our next group to talk about Season 6.

909
01:27:33,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Season 6.

910
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Season 6.

911
01:28:33,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Season 6.

912
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Season 6.

913
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Season 6.

914
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Season 6.

915
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Season 5.

916
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Season 6.

917
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Season 7.

918
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Season 7.

919
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Season 6.

920
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Season 7.

921
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Season 6.

922
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Season 7.

923
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Season 7.

924
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Season 7.

925
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Season 7.

926
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Season 8.

927
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And Season 8.

928
01:29:33,000 --> 01:30:03,000
We'll be right back.

929
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:33,000
We'll be right back.

930
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:45,000
We'll be right back.

931
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:33,000
We'll be right back.

932
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
We'll be right back.

933
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:43,000
We'll be right back.

934
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,000
We'll be right back.

935
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I mostly work on seasons.

936
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I'm Don Adams, I'm the lead season designer for season six,

937
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
the season of Hatred Rising.

938
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Also known as Content Supervisor.

939
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Also known as Content Supervisor.

940
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
There you go.

941
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Time to time.

942
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
There we go.

943
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Awesome, so as Don just mentioned here,

944
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
season six is season of Hatred Rising.

945
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Tim, do you wanna explain to us,

946
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
what Hatred Rising or Brent?

947
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Oh yeah, I'll take this one.

948
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So when we started off with this,

949
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
we really knew we wanted to make sure

950
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
that we were launching a brand new season

951
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
right alongside a vessel of Hatred.

952
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
We wanted that to be day and date.

953
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So continuity was really important to us.

954
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And so the idea that the hatred of Mephisto

955
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
and Nahantu is spilling out into the rest of Sanctuary

956
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
was kind of the anchor that we're holding onto

957
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
and we started talking about what that would mean

958
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
to make a whole season around that.

959
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Awesome.

960
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
And I know with kind of like,

961
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
what players hearing Hatred Rising,

962
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
they're hearing about Mephisto and his hatred

963
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
potentially leaking out into Nahantu,

964
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
maybe the rest of Sanctuary.

965
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Like what can players expect with this actual season?

966
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Yeah, so a lot of actually what is gonna be the core

967
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
of season six and the season six experience,

968
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
players have already gotten exposed to.

969
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
So anybody who's playing on the PTR

970
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
has been reading about the changes we put up there.

971
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Fundamental to the release of Vessel of Hatred,

972
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
season six brings big changes where every single class

973
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
is going to gain access to new skill points.

974
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
They're gonna gain new skills across all the classes.

975
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
They're gonna gain more Paragon points,

976
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
new legendary Paragon glyphs.

977
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
These are all changes that are being added to the base of the game,

978
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
meaning you do not need to have Vessel of Hatred to gain access to these.

979
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
You also will still have access to these after season six.

980
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
These are permanent changes to the game.

981
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
On top of that, we got the standard new legendary aspects.

982
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
We have new unique items and new mythic items.

983
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Crazy powerful mythic items that are going to unlock just new levels of power

984
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
that were not possible before in the game.

985
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Now, to go along with this power, we will be adding these new difficulty levels

986
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
that again we saw on PTR.

987
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
So you have the ability to challenge these new levels of power.

988
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
However, I want to say that it's all gonna even out well.

989
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Honestly, despite the tireless efforts of our designers,

990
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
just constant trying to get that balance just right based on all the feedback that comes in,

991
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I know that maybe it'll be out for a day before someone's posting a video and saying,

992
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Oh, look at this, I do a trillion damage!

993
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And it'll go all over the internet, like, I've never seen numbers this big!

994
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
And that's, yeah.

995
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
But we tried, we tried to get it there.

996
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
You're gonna see crazy builds.

997
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Those are gonna link into new difficulties that were never there before

998
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
to try and all this new content.

999
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Yeah, awesome.

1000
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Yeah, I know all these things that players got to experience a little bit in PTR.

1001
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
They got to see it, they got to check it out early.

1002
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,000
But of course, there is more kind of associated with this specific season.

1003
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
So, Don, do you want to talk a little bit more about what players can also see beyond

1004
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
what Tim kind of walked through?

1005
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1006
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
So, you know, as we mentioned, this is the season of hatred rising.

1007
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
So we really wanted to theme it around Mephisto's hatred creeping out of Nahantu and into the

1008
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
rest of the world.

1009
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
So let's go ahead and take a look at our visual aid here.

1010
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Beautiful.

1011
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Amazing.

1012
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I was promised...

1013
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Official documents!

1014
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I was promised that this would be turned into real art when I sent this over.

1015
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I didn't think we'd be showing this.

1016
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
But hopefully this will all make sense by the end of the presentation.

1017
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Just for now, just take it in.

1018
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
There you go.

1019
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Yeah.

1020
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Everyone loves designer art.

1021
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
It's core to all our live streams that we do.

1022
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Art by Don Adams here.

1023
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
So...

1024
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Yeah.

1025
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
And frankly, I think it speaks for itself.

1026
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I don't really know that there's much more to say.

1027
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
That's it.

1028
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
But let's go on and go ahead to the next slide here.

1029
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
And let's take a look at some real art to get you ready for the season here.

1030
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,000
This is, of course, amazing key art from Dave Raposa.

1031
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
I just love kicking that demon in the face.

1032
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
That makes me happy every time I see it.

1033
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Let's go ahead and move on to the next slide.

1034
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
And I'll get into some actual details about how this stuff shows up in the world.

1035
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
What you're going to be looking for when you're hunting these guys down.

1036
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So you're going to see these hatred rising zone events that cycle frequently throughout

1037
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
the world.

1038
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
When these are up, everything in that area is going to be corrupted by hatred.

1039
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
You're going to be seeing environmental changes, lighting changes.

1040
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:22,000
The monsters will actually have hatred gummy goop on them.

1041
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
You can be ambushed from portals randomly.

1042
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
And really all this is just setting the stage for the Realm Walker.

1043
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,000
So you'll have a separate event icon that'll let you know when the Realm Walker is going

1044
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
to be up.

1045
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
It's a world event, so it'll be in that list on the map with other world bosses and

1046
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Legion events and stuff.

1047
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And we have some video here to kind of show you what it looks like.

1048
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Oh, actually I think we have another slide about the Realm Walker first, sorry.

1049
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
This is what he looks like in game.

1050
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
He's awesome.

1051
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,000
These are just big hulking kind of monstrosities stomping around, just spreading Mephisto's

1052
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
hatred.

1053
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:06,000
They summon in monsters from a plane of hell through this portal on their back.

1054
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
And a lot of the monsters they summon, most of them are actually new monsters from Vessel

1055
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
of Hatred.

1056
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
They're the Hollows family, which are super cool and gross.

1057
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
So I think now we can take a look at what it actually looks like in game.

1058
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
So here's some players waiting for him to spawn.

1059
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
He starts burrowed like that.

1060
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And you can kind of click the portal to summon some stuff to fight while you're getting warmed

1061
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
up here.

1062
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I just love these enemies.

1063
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
They're so cool, the Hollows.

1064
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So he busts out of the ground.

1065
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:38,000
And this is actually, we want to do something new with this event.

1066
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And lean into the fantasy of this giant thing just like stomping around.

1067
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
So it's actually a walking world event.

1068
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
He has several different paths you can take throughout each area.

1069
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:52,000
He walks through the zone and as he walks he just leaves this chaos behind him in his

1070
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
wake.

1071
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
He's summoning tons of Hollows and if you get in front of him he just punts you out of

1072
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
the way and keeps going.

1073
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
You actually can't even damage him directly in this phase.

1074
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
But if you kill enough of the adds that he's spawning, it'll create these bloodbound guardians.

1075
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Killing these will shave some of the HP off of the Realm Walker.

1076
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,000
So when he reaches the end of his path and you can actually fight him, you'll have less

1077
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
HP to burn through.

1078
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
So this is a nice way to incentivize actually participating, sticking around for all this

1079
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
chaos.

1080
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Obviously lots of XP and whatnot from the mobs as well.

1081
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:33,000
So this is the event that he kicks off when he actually gets to his destination.

1082
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:39,000
When you interrupt this ritual by destroying all of these destructible hatred spires, that's

1083
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
when you'll actually be able to fight him directly.

1084
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I think we're going to see that here very quickly.

1085
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
This is a really cool encounter.

1086
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,000
There's just lots of, you know, he has a big smashy attacks.

1087
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
He sprays a lot of damage everywhere.

1088
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Okay, so they've taken him down.

1089
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:00,000
And when he dies, that weird portal on his back drops down and stays open.

1090
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
There's only really one thing to do with a weird portal.

1091
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Yeah.

1092
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
You go in the portal.

1093
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
That's what portals are made for.

1094
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Successfully killing the Realmwalker, taking down this massive demon finally grants you

1095
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
your reward of more demons.

1096
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
So you're going to go into the Seething Realm.

1097
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
This is part of the Mephisto's area of Hell.

1098
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
So you are going to have to continue fighting in here.

1099
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,000
It is not a barren landscape, but the demons you fight in here comparatively, if you were

1100
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
strong enough to take down a Realmwalker, don't be too worried.

1101
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I think you're going to be able to manage the demons inside of the Seething Realm as

1102
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
well.

1103
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
This dungeon is a little bit more of a reward dungeon.

1104
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,000
So once you get in here, you're fighting your way through to get specific buffs at the

1105
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
end of it.

1106
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So if we want, we can jump into the video here.

1107
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Yeah, this is the first section.

1108
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
And this part, you're just kind of mowing through some of these smaller guys.

1109
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
You're really just looking for a specific gate here.

1110
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
There's a portal that you're going to be activating and making an important choice there about

1111
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
which section of the Seething Realm you go into.

1112
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Here it is.

1113
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
So you're going to click on this.

1114
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
You now have options.

1115
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Based on a few consumables that you can put in, you can go into sections that are more

1116
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:14,000
focused on equipment bonus, gold bonus, you can get a socketable bonus, you can get more

1117
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
end game items with like compasses and boss materials.

1118
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
So you're going to pick one of these and decide that's the section I want to go into.

1119
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:27,000
You're going to get some drops similar to that in this section of the dungeon.

1120
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
But more importantly, this is going to set you up for the type of buff you want to get

1121
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,000
at the end of the dungeon.

1122
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
So again, this is not an empty area.

1123
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
You are going to have to fight through it.

1124
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
You're going to encounter more hollows in here, some more elites.

1125
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
All of this leading up to a chest at the end.

1126
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Here's your reward.

1127
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
So finally, you just click on this.

1128
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
You get your reward.

1129
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Ah, just kidding.

1130
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Yeah, of course it's a cursed event.

1131
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Of course.

1132
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
You're going to have to fight even more demons.

1133
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Nothing's free in hell.

1134
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
This is just how you got to do it.

1135
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
So you find your way through some more elites, but don't worry, I believe in you.

1136
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
You can get through this.

1137
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
If you kill the last guy, there's one more there.

1138
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Take him down.

1139
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Come on, Angus.

1140
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
All right.

1141
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
So he goes down.

1142
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Now you get your prizes.

1143
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
You're going to open these chests.

1144
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,000
There's a variety of loot that you get, but one specific item that you're looking for

1145
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
in here, which is going to be a Seething Opal.

1146
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
So these little, there they are.

1147
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Yeah.

1148
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Little Seething Opals.

1149
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
They got a little seasonal marker on them.

1150
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
This is special to season six.

1151
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
When you get these, I'm going to take a look here.

1152
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
This is going to be a buff you get based on the one that you chose.

1153
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
There are some fundamentals you always get.

1154
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,000
So a Seething Opal always gives you a 15% bonus to experience.

1155
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
This is especially cool because it stacks with elixirs.

1156
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
You can have an elixir and a Seething Opal active at the same time.

1157
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
That's a huge bonus.

1158
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,000
On top of that, any Seething Opal that you use is going to allow you to now get reputation

1159
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
with the remnants of the Zakaru.

1160
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Don will talk about that more in just a second, but that's going to be the reputation track

1161
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
for season six.

1162
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:55,000
And then beyond that, you will get a bonus depending on which portal you went through,

1163
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
which section of the Seething Realm you decided to go into.

1164
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Here we get.

1165
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Yeah.

1166
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
If you want to snapshot this, anybody who's screenshotting, these are some of the bonuses

1167
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
you can get.

1168
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,000
As you can see on here, you're getting maybe more items, maybe more gold, more socketables.

1169
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,000
So these bonuses are going to occur while fighting anything while having this buff active.

1170
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
So equipment as an example.

1171
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Maybe I wanted more items to be dropping.

1172
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
When you kill monsters, there's a chance that they're going to drop a cache that is going

1173
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
to give you some additional loot.

1174
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
And if you're playing content in, let's say further in the end game, that monsters don't

1175
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
traditionally drop loot, not to worry.

1176
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
We've adjusted that as well.

1177
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:36,000
If you play through the pit as an example, we have added an additional drop at the end

1178
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
of the pit.

1179
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Again, that procs based on which Seething Opal that you chose.

1180
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
There are a couple up here at the end.

1181
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
So the socketable one, I should mention, that one is special too.

1182
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
You do have to have Vessel of Hatred for that one.

1183
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
This one is more for people that are trying to get more runes.

1184
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
So obviously you need to have Vessel of Hatred to get runes.

1185
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
So that's what's going to make this valuable to you.

1186
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
That's cool to also see like boss summoning items on here.

1187
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Infernal compasses as well.

1188
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Infernal compasses themselves are going to be very valuable because it's, as Colin was

1189
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:14,000
mentioning before, we saw what you can end up getting in in infernal hordes and everything

1190
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
like that.

1191
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
It's just another opportunity to get more compasses for getting in there.

1192
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Yeah, Seething Opal of Tormand I think is great.

1193
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I think that grape flavored opal is going to be very popular.

1194
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Yeah, the grape one is going to be pretty popular.

1195
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,000
And a question I just quickly solved because you mentioned stacking with elixirs.

1196
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Does it also stack with incense?

1197
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yeah, it will stack with incense as well.

1198
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
There you go.

1199
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
So that's a triple stack of XP right there.

1200
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,000
You get a lot of experience.

1201
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Which is actually really cool.

1202
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
So that's awesome.

1203
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
So obviously like, you know, we're seeing the rewards here.

1204
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
And one thing that you had mentioned which was the Zacarum remnants.

1205
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Like what, Don, can you like talk to us a little bit about kind of what that progression

1206
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
track is going to be?

1207
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Yeah, sure.

1208
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So these are the Zacarum remnants.

1209
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
You've probably seen these guys in Howizar.

1210
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
These are the Crusaders with the rusty armor that have just been kind of bumming around

1211
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
since they, you know, they failed to find Akarat's tomb.

1212
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
They have a very personal connection with Mephisto.

1213
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
You know, he of course destroyed basically the Zacarum order many years ago.

1214
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:22,000
And at this time they're still just not really ready to stand up and fight this at full force.

1215
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Right?

1216
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
They've been dealing with cultists and they're just not at their full strength.

1217
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So you'll meet this Crusader right at the start of the season who will give you a very simple intro quest basically

1218
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
to guide you to kill a Realmwalker, clear a seething realm.

1219
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
And he'll be your point of contact for reputation rewards following that.

1220
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:50,000
So, you know, basically we built this in a way that with the Opals giving rep for all sorts of different activities,

1221
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,000
the idea is that you can, you know, go and kind of do whatever you want to do.

1222
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:00,000
As long as you're checking in periodically with the Realmwalker and keeping a stack of these Opals on hand,

1223
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
it's very open-ended how you want to push this reputation track.

1224
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Yeah, it is always nice to see that anywhere that new demons occur in the world,

1225
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
there is always some faction out there that's trying to take care of them and would appreciate your help.

1226
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
So the Zacarum over here, they've had a rough go of it, but if you can help them out, I think that we can handle this problem.

1227
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
They're not at their best right now.

1228
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Yeah.

1229
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
You know, one of the things that I really like about the way we've looked at this whole package is that

1230
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:33,000
not only have we done a bunch of diligence in making sure that the story is taking part in all of Sanctuary,

1231
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:40,000
we're touching on some really cool lore stuff that has existed for a long period of time,

1232
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,000
but we're also leaning into a theme of giving the players more control over the experience.

1233
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:51,000
And so whether it's the choice of reward or being able to stack these rewards to get specific outcomes,

1234
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:57,000
you're going to see that not only in the season, so everybody's going to get access to this in the season,

1235
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:03,000
but we have that theme also creeping into some of the stuff you'll see with the Vessel of Hatred content in just a few minutes.

1236
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Yeah.

1237
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Yeah, so hopefully the hieroglyphs that we saw at the beginning, the designer, hopefully this makes sense now.

1238
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
There it is.

1239
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Yeah.

1240
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:19,000
You kill the Realmwalker to get the portal, you do the portal to get the opals, and then you go do the MS Paint sort of shapes of all the other activities that are in the game.

1241
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:27,000
You can also just chain run the Realmwalker if you'd like as well. He's up very often, and I expect people will kind of go back and forth on how often they're interacting with them.

1242
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
You might want to stack a bunch of opals for the weekend or something, right?

1243
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
If you hate Realmwalkers and just like, I just want to kill Realmwalkers all day, you can.

1244
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:44,000
What I love about the season is exactly that. You can get the opal, it's a great buff, and now go play other content, including the new content that's coming out in Vessel of Hatred if you bought the expansion.

1245
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Got a lot of options there, so you don't have to just play the seasonal content, and you'll play this other stuff while still having the buff.

1246
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Including the Vessel of Hatred campaign, which is kind of a first, right? You'll need to have completed the base campaign, but you can play the Vessel of Hatred campaign alongside the Season 6 content, which is pretty cool.

1247
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Yeah, so huge for people that have base game or Vessel of Hatred can partake in the content for this season.

1248
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Don, Tim, thank you guys for walking us through all the Season of Hatred Rising content that's coming with the launch of Vessel of Hatred.

1249
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:25,000
This is starting right at the beginning, right when Vessel of Hatred actually comes out, which is on, again, October 7th at 4 p.m.

1250
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
For some people.

1251
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
4 p.m. Pacific time, which is for everyone because it is one global release.

1252
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
It will be the 7th for me.

1253
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Yeah, 7th for us here in California, but for other people, if you follow time zones, that's what it will end up being.

1254
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:48,000
So we'll see Tim Moore during our Q&A at the end, but we are actually going to jump into some of the Vessel of Hatred features next.

1255
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:54,000
We're going to do another musical chair as Benny Hill style, swap out some mics and everything, but we have a lot to talk about.

1256
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:01,000
We got Spiritborn stuff to talk about, we got Curras Undercity to talk about.

1257
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Been doing that quite often this week.

1258
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Dark Citadel and, of course, Mercenary.

1259
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
So we'll be back with a whole new crew here in just a couple minutes.

1260
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:37,000
We'll have another team that will focus with internationals in California with Jeff Browdy,

1261
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
As Panic the Donc is the same as Columbus ship.

1262
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
It's the same as Ellic என andicks orствен Elizabetics.

1263
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
The 26th DetroitINO PCs are available on the island from the beach in California.

1264
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
They will call things off the Atlantic Sea.

1265
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:53,000
The system pays off itsman, and it is the same as heaven as the island.

1266
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I'm sorry.

1267
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I'm sorry.

1268
01:49:53,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I'm sorry.

1269
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I'm sorry.

1270
01:50:53,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I'm sorry.

1271
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I'm sorry.

1272
01:51:53,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I'm sorry.

1273
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I'm sorry.

1274
01:52:53,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I'm sorry.

1275
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm sorry.

1276
01:53:52,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I'm sorry.

1277
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
That's all.

1278
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
But Derek, do you want to kick us off?

1279
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Yeah.

1280
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Hey, everyone.

1281
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I'm Derek Nunez, lead season designer, and I'll be chatting about the Kuros underceding

1282
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:32,000
a few.

1283
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Bjorn.

1284
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Bjorn Mikkelsen, class designer for Spirit Porn.

1285
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Hi, I'm Dan Brace.

1286
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I'm Dan Brace.

1287
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I'm Dan Brace.

1288
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I'm a lead game designer, and I'll be talking about Mercenaries.

1289
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Awesome.

1290
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Cool.

1291
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
So, you know, tons of content coming to Vessel of Hatred.

1292
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I know players have heard us talk about it a little bit, but Brent, did you want to talk

1293
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
about any content specifically before we jump in?

1294
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Yeah.

1295
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Yeah.

1296
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
I mean, just kind of teeing up the next big thing that we want to talk about is just kind of

1297
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
how well the Spirit Born reaction has been since we've announced it.

1298
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
It's been amazing to see folks so excited about it.

1299
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
It's something that we've been pouring a lot of love into.

1300
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,000
We wanted to make sure they were adding something fresh to the game, and I really feel like we're

1301
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:16,000
there.

1302
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:21,000
But when we released it, we actually still had work to do.

1303
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
And so throughout the PTR and the last few weeks of development here, we've been putting

1304
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
a lot of effort into polishing things up, and I'm super excited to hear Bjorn talk about

1305
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,000
what we've got in store.

1306
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Yeah.

1307
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Lots of internal testing.

1308
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
We have players actually check it out at Gamescom as well, which was really cool.

1309
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:44,000
So, as we all know, Bjorn was on our Spirit Born reveal stream, and he's back to talk more

1310
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
about Spirit Born.

1311
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And so here is Spirit Bjorn to talk more about the Spirit Born.

1312
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
And do it right away.

1313
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
There we go.

1314
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,000
It's hard for me to actually say Spirit Born now because I just say Spirit Bjorn.

1315
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
So there we go.

1316
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Awesome.

1317
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Yeah.

1318
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Yes, I mean, we've seen a lot of the sort of in development side of it, and we're just

1319
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:08,000
going to talk about a few kind of final touches, the final version of a few things that we want

1320
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
to hit on quickly here in this presentation.

1321
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:16,000
So starting off, we're going to talk about a couple of updates to the Spirit Born's passives.

1322
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,000
First off, we have three additional passives which have been added to the tree.

1323
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:26,000
So each of these kind of amplifies how the skills work that they relate to.

1324
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
So we have one for core skills, one for potency skills, and one for focus skills.

1325
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:35,000
And that sort of lets you kind of go more all in on any of those skills.

1326
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
There's also here on the far side of the slide an update to Noxious Resonance, which is one

1327
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
of Spirit Born's key passives.

1328
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:46,000
We really wanted to kind of clarify how this mechanic works, how it scales, and kind of

1329
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
answer some lingering questions about exactly how it works.

1330
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,000
But it's still largely based around exploding the poisons on your enemies.

1331
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Moving on to another thing.

1332
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
We're going to have a small update to the Jaguar primary Spirit Hall.

1333
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
This will still do lots of damage whenever you spec into it.

1334
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
It's all about damage with the Jaguar.

1335
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:12,000
But this has focused it a little bit more about multi-attack skills, high attack speed,

1336
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
and really allowing you to ramp up the damage that you can get it.

1337
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Because now it's also based around the damage that you did in a short window.

1338
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:26,000
So that lets you sort of echo all of that damage that you did the faster you're attacking.

1339
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Moving on to another small, sort of medium-sized update.

1340
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
There was some confusion around Spirit Feathers, Storm Feathers, the Eagle Hall, how all that

1341
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
kind of works together.

1342
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,000
So this has been unified into a new concept just called Storm Feathers.

1343
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
What this is, is this is a buff that you can get.

1344
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
This increases your movement speed and it stacks duration.

1345
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
And now all of these things, they all speak to the Storm Feather concept.

1346
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
So you can get them, you can modify them, you can make them do different things.

1347
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
And you can even like use it to make kind of some crazy builds.

1348
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I think we have a video for it where you can just kind of have feathers going all over the

1349
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
place as you're doing it.

1350
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
And you can even use like tempering and various paragon that increases Storm Feather potency

1351
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,000
that will speak to all of these aspects as well as the Eagle Primary Hall.

1352
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:18,000
And then moving on to the last thing we've got should be our Uniques.

1353
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
So some of you might have gotten to see some early versions of these.

1354
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,000
But we want to kind of show off the final versions with all of their stats and all of

1355
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
their glory.

1356
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,000
So to start off we have six unique Spirit Born Rings.

1357
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Each of these kind of emphasizes a combination of two spirits.

1358
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,000
And really lets you sort of tailor how you generate your resource.

1359
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,000
to sort of make the build that you're looking to make.

1360
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Then moving on to our Unique Armors.

1361
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,000
We showed off the Scorn of the Earth boots that turns your Soarin to Evade.

1362
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
And everybody really loved that.

1363
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
A couple other examples.

1364
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
We've got Craze of the Dead God.

1365
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Which allows you to turn all damage coming at you into poisoning damage.

1366
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,000
And then sort of throw that back out at your enemies in the form of Touch of Death.

1367
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Which is pretty neat.

1368
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
And then we've also got our Helms.

1369
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
We have two different Unique Helms.

1370
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:14,000
One is focused more along the lines of letting you sort of mix and match spirits.

1371
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000
While the other one is more about kind of doubling down on using a single Spirit.

1372
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
And then finally we have our Unique Weapons.

1373
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
We've got several Glaives and Quarterstaffs.

1374
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
We already showed off the basic one.

1375
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
But we're going to quickly show off sort of its counterpart.

1376
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Which is the one for your core skills.

1377
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,000
So this one allows you to sort of spam your core skills.

1378
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Almost as if they were basics.

1379
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
That's sort of reduced damage.

1380
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
But when you're at maximum vigor.

1381
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
It ramps up to be a maximum size guaranteed crit.

1382
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Just massive screen clearing version of the core skill.

1383
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
So we think that one's pretty fun too.

1384
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:54,000
And then lastly I believe I have a slide just for yeah there we go.

1385
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Our drop tables for the bosses.

1386
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,000
So if you're looking to target farm any of these specific ones similar to the other classes.

1387
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
You can kind of farm these based on different bosses.

1388
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
So take a screenshot of this.

1389
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
And go for it.

1390
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Awesome.

1391
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Yeah.

1392
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Tons of updates.

1393
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I mean we've done so much internal testing.

1394
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
We've heard a lot of feedback.

1395
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Because we have that deep dive blog.

1396
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
We've seen people theory craft.

1397
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
We've seen people actually play it at Gamescom.

1398
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,000
We've had a couple content creators like during the Spirit Born livestream.

1399
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And even during our like kind of a preview event.

1400
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
They actually got to try it out and stuff.

1401
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
So hearing all this feedback.

1402
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
And then you know applying some of the feedback.

1403
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And some of the internal feedback that we ended up getting.

1404
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
And seeing all the changes here.

1405
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
And updating everyone has been really cool to see.

1406
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:41,000
So thank you again Bjorn for walking us through the Spirit Born.

1407
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
The class is incredibly fun.

1408
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I, day one is what I'm planning for Vessel of Hadrian.

1409
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I think most of us are.

1410
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
But yeah it's a ton of fun to check out.

1411
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Next up that what we wanted to talk about is Curious Under City.

1412
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:59,000
This is actually a feature that we did announce with Gamescom.

1413
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:05,000
But we didn't really get a ton of opportunities to really kind of like dive deeper into what

1414
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Curious Under City is.

1415
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
So Derek you want to take us through this?

1416
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Yeah absolutely.

1417
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
So the Curious Under City is a brand new dungeon experience that players, our Vessel of Hatred

1418
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
players will be unlocking throughout the course of the campaign.

1419
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
It's appropriately located in the new capital city of Curious.

1420
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,000
But it's the part of town that's not recommended that the standard citizen will venture into.

1421
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:34,000
It's a section of the Curious town that is still infested by the jungles of Nahantu and kind

1422
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
of overrun with the worst of the worst.

1423
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:42,000
It's Nahantu's most wanted inside the various districts that make up the Under City.

1424
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Throughout the course as players are unlocking it they'll meet a new character named Seaheck

1425
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,000
that kind of teaches you the laws of the Under City and how to commune with the Spirit Flames

1426
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
to traverse its treacherous depths basically.

1427
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,000
So that's kind of like the narrative setting for it but let's dive into the actual experiential

1428
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
standpoint which we see here already.

1429
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:07,000
So the Curious Under City is an intense multi-floor time attack dungeon where players will be

1430
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:13,000
racing against an aggressive countdown timer to reach the district boss with as high of

1431
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:20,000
a rewards upgrade meter built up as possible and try not to let that timer expire.

1432
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:25,000
So fun little novel wrinkle here is that killing certain monsters we refer to as afflicted

1433
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:30,000
will give you time bonuses to extend your time in the Under City and just killing monsters

1434
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:36,000
in general and completing dungeon activities will build up this reward upgrade meter referred

1435
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
to in game as attunement.

1436
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:46,000
As far as the Under City's role it's one new novel leveling content but its power really

1437
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,000
comes into the fact that it's brand new opportunistic content that allows players to make

1438
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:56,000
very efficient, very specific progress towards rewards goals as the opportunities arise.

1439
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I'll dive deeper into that in the next few slides but for now just want to kind of set

1440
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:07,000
the stage that the Under City does not necessarily have any objective aside from get to the boss,

1441
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:13,000
beat the clock and do so with the highest amount of rewards upgrades built up as possible.

1442
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
How the players go about doing that is entirely up to them.

1443
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Because this is again a dungeon that celebrates autonomy, flow and variety.

1444
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:26,000
And this is a good example we were talking about earlier when we're looking at the new modes

1445
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,000
that we have we want that player agency to come back to the player.

1446
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Yeah.

1447
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Play your way.

1448
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
And I think this is a perfect example of that.

1449
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1450
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So let's dive into the next slide here.

1451
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Cool.

1452
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:45,000
So I mentioned opportunistic content and this is where the Under City's primary role in

1453
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,000
the reward structure is.

1454
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
So we have dungeon keys that grant you access to dungeons.

1455
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,000
The Under City's version of a dungeon key is in the form of tributes.

1456
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:59,000
So you can hop into an Under City run without a tribute, just do the thing, the base run.

1457
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
But when you start applying tributes, this is where we allow you to define the specific

1458
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:10,000
reward upgrade opportunities of your next Under City run at the cost of increasing the

1459
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
runs challenge.

1460
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
So you can see an example of a tribute here.

1461
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
This is the Tribute of Radiance.

1462
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:21,000
And when you slot this in, so long as you complete your Under City run with at least Attunement

1463
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:27,000
rank one, we will guarantee that you get Ancestral Legendaries at the end.

1464
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
We'll dive a little bit deeper into some of the nuances.

1465
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
You can see that it has dungeon affixes that define the specific challenge.

1466
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:38,000
So the higher and more powerful the tribute, the tougher the challenge is in the form of

1467
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:42,000
lower starting time, time bonus penalties, and potion drop penalties.

1468
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
But the fun doesn't really stop there.

1469
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
In fact, we're just getting started.

1470
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Once you apply a tribute, you now unlock the ability to define a bargain.

1471
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Each tribute has a list of bargains mapped to it.

1472
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,000
So this Tribute of Radiance has a collection of them.

1473
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,000
We're just picking out a couple that seem pretty fun to show off.

1474
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:08,000
And bargains allow you to further customize your rewards at a varying material cost.

1475
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
So we have one here, skill ranks.

1476
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Legendary armors will always possess at least one skill rank affix for X amount of gold here.

1477
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
And then the passive ranks, which you'll see a little bit more later.

1478
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:22,000
The legendary amulets will always possess at least one passive rank affix.

1479
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,000
So let's go into the next slide just to, again, recap the full flow.

1480
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:32,000
And we're going to see a video of all this to let it all kind of like soak in and see like the full flow of the under city.

1481
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
So we have the front end experience where you interact with the spirit brazier.

1482
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:47,000
You can jump directly into your district run or you can optionally apply a tribute and then a bargain to specify the rewards opportunity for your next run.

1483
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
So let's go see this in action.

1484
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Look at that.

1485
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:57,000
So this is the hub of the under city and that's the spirit brazier that I was mentioning.

1486
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,000
You can see that we have the base, you know, the base run rules.

1487
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:04,000
You know, starting time, no time bonus penalties, no potion drop penalties.

1488
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,000
And we have the opportunity to apply a tribute.

1489
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
We have four tributes here.

1490
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,000
So, you know, we'll show these in a still shot later.

1491
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
So you don't have to like worry about, oh, what does it say?

1492
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:21,000
But we have four tributes here that range from magic all the way to

1493
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:26,000
unique to, you know, accommodate your, your leveling journeys.

1494
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,000
So for now we applied the legendary tribute that'll guarantee

1495
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
ancestral uniques at the end of your run.

1496
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:37,000
And again, this is the list of potential bargains that I mentioned that each tribute has.

1497
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Each tribute has like varying quantities of bargains attached to it.

1498
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,000
So we're going to pick the passive rank legendary amulets for the low, low price of 50 million gold.

1499
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:52,000
The spirit flame services don't come cheap, but they're worth it.

1500
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,000
So we got the portal open and we're going to hop into the run.

1501
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
We're going to have this play a couple of times.

1502
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,000
First, I just want to point out the HUD because this is really kind of your guide to the experience.

1503
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:07,000
So you can see at the top, once we exited that spirit aura, the timer starts.

1504
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And that's a nice little, you know, timer at the top right hand corner of your screen.

1505
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,000
We also display the number of floors that you have, you know, left to traverse.

1506
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Very key information right there.

1507
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:23,000
To the right hand side of the objective tracker, we have the attunement meter and it's segmented into four ranks.

1508
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Again, as I mentioned, achieving rank one is the bare minimum requirement necessary to get the value of the tribute that you slotted in.

1509
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:35,000
All subsequent ranks further enhance the value of that reward.

1510
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:45,000
So while you certainly want to strive to get, you know, attunement rank four to maximize your payout, it's not necessary if you're feeling the pinch of, you know, the time pressure.

1511
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:52,000
That if you at least get attunement rank one, you can, you know, run it to the boss room and still come away with the thing that you're looking for.

1512
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I'm going to point out a couple of things here.

1513
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
You might have seen, let's do the spirit beacon.

1514
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:04,000
So the spirit beacon is one of our activity types and completing it both gives you attunement, a good splash of attunement.

1515
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:13,000
And it applies a momentary, you know, spirit buff that increases your movement speed and reduces your, was it the skill cooldowns.

1516
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Again, you got to move fast in the inner city.

1517
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:24,000
So these spirit beacons are incredibly useful for getting you to the next location, whether it's another spirit beacon or the exit.

1518
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:32,000
We're also kind of showing here the lesser afflicted, as you can see, you know, they're clearly marked in the game world.

1519
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,000
They're all, you know, orangey, glowy, so you can, you know, keep your focus on the combat.

1520
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:42,000
And killing them is what gives you the time bonuses to extend your run.

1521
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I think that's kind of the long and short of the inner city run.

1522
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Again, this is an example of floor one. There's still two more floors to traverse to get to the boss room.

1523
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,000
But yeah, let's hop up. There we go. We're into the boss room.

1524
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:59,000
So in this case, we have finished all three floors. We made it to the boss room.

1525
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:04,000
One thing you notice that time expiration, it stops. Time drain stops in the boss room.

1526
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,000
So you just need to make it to the boss room before that timer hits zero.

1527
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:12,000
This is Aaliyah, one of our three district bosses.

1528
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:17,000
And it's important to call out that there are three total districts to explore in the undercity.

1529
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Again, that's tapping into the variety aspect of things.

1530
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:26,000
So Aaliyah is again, just one of three henchmen that own the various districts.

1531
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,000
So in this case, we're at the tail end of this fight.

1532
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
We just, you know, killed Aaliyah.

1533
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:38,000
And we see that we ended this run with a full reward upgrade of four.

1534
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
So now we're going to get the best possible payout for this.

1535
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,000
And we came in here looking for Ancestral Legendaries.

1536
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:50,000
And as the Spirit Flames promised, Ancestral Legendaries is what we get.

1537
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
And, you know, the greater affixes.

1538
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
And we also see that we got an amulet.

1539
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
If we were to dive into like the amulet, we would have seen that the bargain would have applied to it as well.

1540
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,000
So the player would have gotten specifically what they came in here for.

1541
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:11,000
So that's a really quick snapshot of just like the structure of an undercity flow.

1542
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I want to take this time just to dive into a little bit more details on the tributes that we saw in the gameplay footage

1543
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
and spend a little more time with them.

1544
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:23,000
So this is an example of four of our eight total tributes.

1545
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:31,000
These are hand selected primarily just to showcase how the tributes are tuned to progress with your leveling journeys.

1546
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,000
So we start off here with the Tribute of Growth.

1547
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
This is usable in all difficulty levels.

1548
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:41,000
This is the tribute that rewards additional experience when you complete the undercity.

1549
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,000
So this is great, you know, for leveling up your alts, leveling up your character in general.

1550
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:54,000
And you can see here that we start applying the first of the, you know, I guess penalties or challenges for this in the sense that we have lower starting time.

1551
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
We actually incur a time bonus penalty now.

1552
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
And we have potion drop penalties.

1553
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Something also to note is, you know, this is just found randomly in Sanctuary.

1554
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:12,000
So as you're just doing your standard leveling stuff like the Helltides or whatever, you will get these types of tributes to say, you know, point you to the undercity every now and again.

1555
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:17,000
So let's go back to the tribute gallery, as I like to call it.

1556
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Can we go back to that last slide that we had up there?

1557
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
There we go.

1558
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Yeah.

1559
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,000
All right.

1560
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Cool.

1561
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Thank you.

1562
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:28,000
And then we get to, from there, just gets progressively more challenging, but also progressively more rewarding for the players.

1563
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
So Tribute of Harmony rewards guaranteed runes.

1564
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:34,000
This is a Torment tier difficulty.

1565
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,000
And you can see, you know, we just amp up the challenge with each one.

1566
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:44,000
The Tribute of Radiance is the one that we just saw in action that we guaranteed Ancestral Legendaries.

1567
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:55,000
And the Tribute of Ascendence is example of kind of like the cream of the crop tribute, unique tribute that guarantees several uniques with an increased chance of a mythic unique.

1568
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:06,000
And I just want to call it out here that I know that the last two Tributes say that, you know, they're Resolute Tributes and they only, you know, apply rewards to the player that offered it.

1569
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,000
We do have variants of both of these that work in party.

1570
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
So that, you know, hole is covered.

1571
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,000
The rest of the Tributes that don't have that distinction, they reward everyone in the party.

1572
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,000
It's just these last two that, you know, kind of had that little, you know, asterisk on it.

1573
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Yeah, I think that's the Gallery of the Tributes.

1574
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:37,000
And again, these are mapped to the rest of them are mapped to a variety of content like the Whisper Caches, the Summon Lair Bosses, and a variety of things that I'm forgetting on the spot here.

1575
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Yeah, this is a fantastic activity to do when you're somewhat in the mid-game of your journey.

1576
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,000
So you're going to be introduced to this as you're making your way through the campaign.

1577
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:54,000
And but the thing I like about it is with all the progression changes that we've been looking at, this also scales with you.

1578
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,000
And so this is the type of activity that's going to stick with you for a while.

1579
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
It's a great way to get control over looking for the items you're looking for.

1580
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
And the time attack feature of this is really great.

1581
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Yeah.

1582
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:09,000
And I think the big thing here is like you can do it solo or you can do it with a group.

1583
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:16,000
So it's not like you have other options if you want to bring in a full party or if you like to just conquer it yourself.

1584
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:20,000
And I know a lot of people in chat are going like, hey, 50 million for all that.

1585
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,000
There are, I'm not sure if you guys saw all the different bargains and everything.

1586
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
There's a plethora of different costs for a lot of different options.

1587
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
And depending on what you're looking for, you can obviously target specific things.

1588
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,000
You may specifically want, you know, uniques or something like that.

1589
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
And that like chaotic uniques, I think, had like an oval requirement or whatever.

1590
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:42,000
So there's a lot of different bargain options for players to get.

1591
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:49,000
And if you are looking for specific rewards, you have an additional avenue to do so, which is really cool with Curious Under City.

1592
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,000
So, yeah.

1593
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Awesome.

1594
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Cool.

1595
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Oh, I think there's more actually.

1596
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
We're not doing that.

1597
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
We're not doing that.

1598
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
We're not doing that.

1599
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
We're not doing that.

1600
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
The best prices.

1601
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Yeah.

1602
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
The Curious Under City is the gift that keeps on giving.

1603
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:10,000
So, one additional activity that you'll discover as you're, you know, romping through the Under City is our Under City unique treasure goblin, the Portal Prankster.

1604
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:19,000
We'll show some gameplay footage in just a moment, but first I just want to, you know, call out killing him will reward a bonus chest at the end of the dungeon.

1605
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:25,000
And in addition, that contains just standard, you know, treasure goblin loot, runes, and more tributes.

1606
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:32,000
So it's a really good, very juicy reward to go after the Portal Prankster when you come across him.

1607
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:45,000
But you would be doing so at your own peril because you'll see in this video that he has a particular mechanic to him that makes it a little bit tricky when you have a continual timer that's continually counting down.

1608
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:51,000
So you'll see here that when he's aggroed, he opens up a bunch of portals and just like Benny hills through them.

1609
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
It's a chase.

1610
02:14:52,000 --> 02:15:03,000
So this is kind of tapping into the risk versus reward nature of the Under City where you make decisions based on how confident you are at the current state of your run.

1611
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:12,000
And again, killing him is very lucrative. He doesn't drop anything aside from attunement right from the get-go, but all of his rewards are funneled at the end of the experience.

1612
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:19,000
So again, a variety of the spice of life in the Under City and just, yeah, really excited to get this into the hands of players.

1613
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Yeah, it's cool to see a new goblin varying right there. And then of course, you know, the ultimate troll goblin as you can see in the gameplay.

1614
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:37,000
And that's the risk reward you were talking about. Like, do you spend the time chasing after this specific goblin as it's bouncing between different portals,

1615
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
as your time is ticking down and you're trying to progress and get better rewards?

1616
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:47,000
And of course, if you succeed and you get everything, you get that extra chest at the end, which is really awesome.

1617
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Yeah, it's worth it.

1618
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Yeah, most definitely is worth it, especially since you get so much progress added once you do actually take down the goblin as well.

1619
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:01,000
So thank you, Derek, for walking us through this. We have a bunch of seats here.

1620
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:10,000
We actually have a non-physical seat here because we do actually have one other person that we're going to be tapping into to talk to us about the Dark Citadel.

1621
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:19,000
And this is Mr. Jason Bentley, who is live via satellite. I'm going to say satellite from the East Coast.

1622
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Jason is our lead raid designer on Dark Citadel. And Jason, do you want to talk to us a little bit about it?

1623
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Absolutely. Thanks for having me. As you heard, I'm the lead for the Dark Citadel.

1624
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:39,000
And we're going to talk about Rise of the Khazra. This is the very first multiplayer focused piece of content for Diablo 4.

1625
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:53,000
So as you can kind of guess, this whole thing is about essence and souls and sealing them and owning them and just using it as power.

1626
02:16:53,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Go ahead. So why are we here? We're here to fight the first Khazra.

1627
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:08,000
They are taking over the crater left from the Mage Clan Civil War, blasted a hole into the ground and they've moved in.

1628
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:16,000
And they're using all the souls from the dead clan, dead Mage Clan people to power their crazy experiments.

1629
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:25,000
They're really, really evil. They are taking people. They take their own kind and they turn them into like power sources and batteries and they use them.

1630
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:32,000
And they're all about resurrecting their dead god Zagral.

1631
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:39,000
This all takes place in or starts in Nihantu. You start out the whole quest line in Khorast.

1632
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:49,000
They're going to tell you how bad this is. They really don't like having their friends and family stolen and taken and drained and having Huss returned.

1633
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:55,000
So you're going to go on a quest to go find out what's happened to these people and see if you can go help.

1634
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
A lot of other heroes have actually tried this and they have all failed.

1635
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:05,000
So really, when you get through this entire experience, what you really come back with is only together can we prevail.

1636
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:11,000
We need to bring some friends with you to come to this content. You're not going to be able to do it on your own.

1637
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Once you get through all of this, this actually only happens at tournament one.

1638
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:27,000
So this is not a early leveling experience. This is something when you've you're really into the game and you really need to like move your build along.

1639
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:38,000
So once you enter tournament one, you can go on this quest and access the ancient nexus, which is its own town space with a waypoint of all its own, which gives access to the three dungeons.

1640
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:45,000
You can see here these dungeons have multiple boss fights in each one, and they each take a little bit of time to get through.

1641
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Practice will help you optimize these runs. Experience will help you show expertise and shepherding other people to show them how to complete these mechanics.

1642
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,000
And communication is not required, but it definitely leads to better outcomes.

1643
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:07,000
There's a lot of new challenges and mechanics, and there's really no mercy for the hardcore players.

1644
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:19,000
So you have to be good too. As you can see right now, we've actually got one party split across two different realms, doing different mechanics and helping each other and bringing coming back together to bring down the boss.

1645
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:29,000
It really takes at least two players to do these mechanics.

1646
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:34,000
We have multiplayer boss fights through the entire experience, and we always say that players are stronger together.

1647
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:45,000
It's tuned for four players. Two players can do these mechanics, but it means you have to handle the mechanics and the monsters and the bosses by yourselves.

1648
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,000
We're not going to duck the difficulty for fewer players.

1649
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:57,000
We have lots of crazy mechanics going on. We've got people relying on each other to get through all of this.

1650
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:12,000
There's a lot of hero moments in this content. The best moments we had when we were playtesting this is somebody's dead and the other person's running around and they click the switch or they rez the other, their friend right in time to jump through the portal or kill the boss.

1651
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:27,000
And everyone's just screaming and having a great time. It's really, really fun to work together and see those moments where like depending on your your party members really pays off.

1652
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:32,000
We also have an exclusive monster family for the for the Dark Citadel.

1653
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:37,000
These are the newest, smartest monsters you have met. These are the first Kazura.

1654
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Pretty evil people. Shout out to the first Kazura monster family team. They did a great job on all of these guys.

1655
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:50,000
They are awful. They're decadent. They're sophisticated. They use a lot of magic. They do a lot of crazy things to like bring down the party.

1656
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,000
These are cool looking enemies. That's for sure.

1657
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:11,000
I know with, with at least Dark Citadel, of course, there's always awesome rewards that are kind of associated with this. Jason, do you want to talk to us a little bit about those?

1658
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Absolutely.

1659
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I think we have that queued up. Yeah, let's see if we can get that queued up here.

1660
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
But the joys of

1661
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Well, we do have. We did it. Oh, actually, the quality of life improvement here.

1662
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:30,000
We actually have a marker system to help parties get through the experience.

1663
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,000
You can just drop them into your emote wheel.

1664
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:38,000
And then as you're running through the experience, you can use those emotes to indicate to your friends and party members.

1665
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Hey, I found something of interest or hey, it's over here. This is the way forward.

1666
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
And then really nice thing is this is available outside the Citadel as well. It's not exclusive.

1667
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:50,000
So you'd be able to use this wherever you go with your party.

1668
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:59,000
We also have a combat log during the Citadel experience to help you understand what's happening, especially where you're taking damage from and big moments.

1669
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:06,000
And you've heard about the party finder. That's also created with obviously Citadel in mind, but it supports everybody else.

1670
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:11,000
But we want to make sure we facilitate getting lots of people into this content.

1671
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Hopefully now we can talk about rewards.

1672
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Well, before we jump into that, I do want to make mention because that was a really interesting screen to see the communication stuff and talking about party finder.

1673
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:27,000
One of the things that we've seen since launch is that our cooperative player basis is growing.

1674
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:32,000
You know, it's growing steadily. And so we wanted to make sure that we did a couple of things.

1675
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,000
First off, we wanted end game content for them. Right.

1676
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:42,000
That's what this is all about is making sure that we have that really aspirational end game content for folks who like to play with their friends.

1677
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:48,000
The other thing is, is that we know that we could let this spread out into more segments of the game.

1678
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:54,000
And so the party fighter was originally a discussion that we had for how to support the dark Citadel.

1679
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:59,000
But it is now benefiting all the other activities in our game as well.

1680
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:09,000
So for those of you who experience you're seeing the early stages of us really expanding, getting people together in the content that is the best inside of the game.

1681
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:18,000
And so it's really exciting. But it does boil down to that communication and that marker system is something that can be both used in the Citadel as well as outside of the Citadel.

1682
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Yeah. And I think that that's going to be really valuable for accessibility for a lot of folks out there.

1683
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Yep. That's definitely. All right. Now on to rewards.

1684
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Now we'll talk rewards. There we go. Sorry. Had to get that in there.

1685
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Absolutely. So you're actually chasing a weekly reward that resets on the Tuesday or the day of the week that we set.

1686
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:47,000
So really, that's going to drop a massive ancestral loot drop each time you pop that open, which is only happens when you complete all three dungeons.

1687
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:52,000
You're going to want to chase that thing. That is a huge important drop for a week.

1688
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,000
But beyond that, there's lots of rewards for repeated runs.

1689
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:06,000
The Citadel coins are going to allow you to purchase all of these consumables and you can maximize the number of coins you get per run by killing treasury monsters and playing on higher difficulties.

1690
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Like it really scales up the Citadel coins you get. And why do you care about those?

1691
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Well, A, these rewards make or say these consumables really make it easier and more fun to play with groups and parties.

1692
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:23,000
But it also allows purchase of the scroll of restoration.

1693
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:30,000
So if you want to like just chase down and buy scrolls, this is a great place to do that.

1694
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Sick slide for production right there.

1695
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Yeah.

1696
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,000
We're drilling this live, right?

1697
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Yeah, exactly.

1698
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:42,000
No, that's actually really cool to see. And again, the scroll of restoration being a reward in Dark Citadel.

1699
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:46,000
And like what we talked about earlier, you actually do get two guaranteed ones in the season journey.

1700
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Yep.

1701
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
And at the same time, those are something that you can find all around the world.

1702
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:54,000
But Dark Citadel is like also just like that guaranteed way of being able to get it as well.

1703
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:00,000
So there's a lot of different variety of rewards. But it goes beyond what we just showed right there.

1704
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,000
There's actually some really, really cool stuff as well that I know Jason wants to show off as.

1705
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Absolutely. I would love to end up on just the way everyone can show off their ability to just play this content to the top levels.

1706
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:20,000
So we're going to show you our premier gear. There's actually two levels of gear that you can get from playing the Dark Citadel.

1707
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:27,000
There's the normal level gear, which you'll get from Torments one through three, and it's pretty accessible.

1708
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:34,000
But what you're seeing right now is our premier content, which comes from only completions in Torment four.

1709
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:39,000
So I hope this is exciting for everyone to get as I'm excited to give it to you.

1710
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:43,000
So I'll see you in the Citadel and thank you for letting me show this off.

1711
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Awesome. Thank you so much, Jason.

1712
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Jason, this mount. Go back to the mount. Go back to the mount. Go back to the mount.

1713
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I know you were probably like, oh, we've got to scroll through everything.

1714
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:56,000
But okay, there we go. The mount is sick.

1715
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Oh, see. Sculpt it. There we go.

1716
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Do it live.

1717
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Okay. Yeah, the mount is sick.

1718
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:07,000
That's something that I think a lot of people are going to be kind of like chasing after for sure with the Dark Citadel.

1719
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Jason, thank you so much for walking us through that.

1720
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Really excited for it.

1721
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:16,000
And what's cool is like, as Jason mentioned, Dark Citadel itself, you can do it with a group of four.

1722
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
You can even attempt to go for two people.

1723
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:22,000
If you're really skilled, you have that option of being able to do it.

1724
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,000
The party finder feature now being part of the game.

1725
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Now you can actually access party finder, find other people that may want to jump into Dark Citadel and group up with them.

1726
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:41,000
And of course we have the additional communication tools with all the different pings that you can end up using and markers that you can end up using to help kind of guide that whole entire group there.

1727
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
So lots of cool stuff coming with Dark Citadel.

1728
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Really cool end game content that's coming to Vessel of Hatred.

1729
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
And I can't wait to see people jump into it.

1730
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Can't wait to jump into it myself.

1731
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:55,000
But of course, we have one last topic that we do want to talk about with Vessel of Hatred.

1732
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:58,000
And that is our mercenaries feature.

1733
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:05,000
That is something that we did announce during Gamescom, but we do want to go into a little bit of a deeper dive today on that specifically.

1734
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:09,000
So Brent, Dan, do you guys want to take us through mercenaries?

1735
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Yeah, just to kick it off, you know, mercenaries is one of those legacy features that you've seen in multiple Diablo games.

1736
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:25,000
And when we started talking about this very early on, we're like, what is the approach that we can take that really compliments everything else that we're doing in Diablo 4 that is different?

1737
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Obviously, we've been touching things like itemization and we've been doing a bunch of reworks on class builds.

1738
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
So we knew a couple of things here.

1739
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:40,000
First, we wanted to make sure that the system was built in a way that could complement your build type, right?

1740
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:50,000
So every build type has a little bit of a soft spot and mercenaries is a really good way of you can level them up in a way that can actually fill in that soft spot.

1741
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:58,000
And the other thing that we really wanted to make sure of is that they were always useful, right?

1742
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:11,000
And so as you play along the game, you're interacting with them in way different ways than you would just by leveling up and using them basically as a power item, right?

1743
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:17,000
And so the way that we folded this in is far more robust than we've seen in other systems in the past.

1744
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
And yeah, I can't wait for Dan to show it off.

1745
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Awesome. Yeah, let's dive into it.

1746
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
So I think we can go to the first slide. Awesome.

1747
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:30,000
So we announced these characters at Gamescom and these are the four mercenaries that you're going to meet as you play Vessel of Hatred.

1748
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Early on in the campaign, you're going to meet Rahir, the guy in the middle, and you're going to lend him a hand in kind of tracking down these other characters, doing their quest lines and unlocking them.

1749
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:47,000
And they're like really involved quest lines. They're pretty awesome. They have cut scenes. They have, you know, a lot of narrative and backstory where you kind of get to know more about these characters.

1750
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,000
And they have a lot of personality, so they're pretty interesting.

1751
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:53,000
And we really want to make them feel like characters that live in the world.

1752
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:59,000
They don't just sit in the hideout the whole time when you're running around and you might see an event where they're actually participating in the event.

1753
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:03,000
So you may even run into some of these characters before you unlock them.

1754
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Cool. So today I'm going to cover a little bit more detail than what we announced at Gamescom.

1755
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:12,000
I'm going to talk about play style and perk for each mercenary.

1756
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,000
I'm going to talk about reinforcements, which is a new way to interact with mercenaries.

1757
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:19,000
And then we're going to talk about bartering and progression at the end.

1758
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Alright, so I'm going to talk about the play styles for each mercenary.

1759
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,000
And to start, I want to just show an example of a skill tree.

1760
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:32,000
So every skill tree for a mercenary at the very top, the starting node is their perk.

1761
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:36,000
And this is a passive bonus you get whenever a mercenary is hired into your party.

1762
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
And they're pretty awesome. They're really powerful.

1763
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Hopefully when you hire a merc, you feel like they're changing the way you play.

1764
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:45,000
And then every skill tree has six skills and 12 upgrades.

1765
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,000
So let's dive into some examples.

1766
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:53,000
So for Rahir, he's really like the tank if you need someone to help protect you.

1767
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:59,000
And his skill tree is kind of split up into a tower shield, which is about getting in the thick of battle,

1768
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
tanking things for you, taunting.

1769
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:06,000
And he also has a round shield, which is sort of themed around being a holy protector.

1770
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:11,000
So the top node that you start with for Rahir, and this is when you hire him to your party, is Valiance.

1771
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:15,000
And what this does is basically if you take a lot of damage in one hit,

1772
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:20,000
he's going to fly in, negate that damage, block it for you, and he's going to knock down enemies.

1773
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,000
He's also going to grant you unstoppable. So he can really save your life.

1774
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:28,000
So here's an example where this beast is going to hit me, and these guys hit pretty hard.

1775
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:33,000
So here comes, boom. So we're here kind of leapt in, he negated that damage, and he knocked them down.

1776
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
So that's awesome.

1777
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:40,000
I imagine hardcore players will gravitate towards this unless they are risk takers.

1778
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,000
So definitely a very powerful perk.

1779
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Cool. Let's talk about some upgrades.

1780
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I think we skipped ahead a slide if we want to go back one.

1781
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,000
There we go. Cool. So here's some upgrade examples on Rahir's skill tree.

1782
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,000
The first one, draw fire. We're going to show a video in a second.

1783
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Whenever I use a healing potion, Rahir's going to taunt enemies near him.

1784
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,000
So if you're in danger, you need health, it's going to help save you.

1785
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Iron Wolf's virtue. When Rahir's valiance is triggered, he heals you, and his cooldown is reduced.

1786
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
So you can just get it to happen more often.

1787
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:20,000
And he has a shield throw, which some D3 Crusader players might love, where he chucks his shield.

1788
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:23,000
It bounces off some targets, and this kind of marks them.

1789
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:26,000
So you can sort of play whack-a-mole, and if you hit those targets, you'll get healed back.

1790
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
So it's another way to keep yourself alive.

1791
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,000
All right, cool. Let's check out an example for draw fire.

1792
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:37,000
So you're going to see I use my potion. The UI would help you show it, but yeah, I use the potion right there.

1793
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Rahir taunted everybody. Sweet. I did not die, and I'm happy.

1794
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,000
All right, let's go to the next one.

1795
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:49,000
So Varjana, we call her the Berserker Crone.

1796
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:53,000
She is a reformed cannibal. She's got a pretty interesting backstory.

1797
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I love her personality. She's kind of zany and crazy.

1798
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:01,000
She's also the cook for the mercenaries, and I don't know if I would eat her food.

1799
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I don't really trust her. But her skill tree is kind of split up into two themes.

1800
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Dual-wield axes, which is all about visceral cleaves and bleeds, and large mace, which is heavy slams.

1801
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:17,000
So you may be familiar with the massacre bonus from D3.

1802
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Her perk is very similar, where basically you get this bonus. We could jump to the video.

1803
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:27,000
And as you kill monsters, you're going to see when I get 10 kills, the massacre bonus kicks in.

1804
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
It's going to show up above her portrait on the left side of the screen.

1805
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
So it should say times 10. Cool.

1806
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I now have a massacre bonus started. As I build this up and I get it to higher thresholds,

1807
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
I'm going to get more and more movement speed.

1808
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:43,000
So you're kind of encouraged to play more aggressive. Keep this going before it runs out of time.

1809
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:47,000
And it sort of snowballs into this fun gameplay where you're going really fast.

1810
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:56,000
So you can embrace your inner Sanic and go real fast with Varyana as your hired merc.

1811
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Alright, I got some upgrades for Varyana. So Dismembering is...

1812
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Oh yeah, sorry. So this one is going to guarantee an overpower.

1813
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
She's going to knock people down and you get a guaranteed overpower.

1814
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
So if you're playing Barb, it's going to be really useful.

1815
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Reprisal is when you get CC'd, Varyana is going to leap on the enemy that inflicted it and knock them down.

1816
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:21,000
So this can also save your life. And no escape is... Varyana does whirlwind.

1817
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:25,000
This makes it really big and as she's spinning around, she's kind of grouping enemies up for you.

1818
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:29,000
So that can be a fun one. I think we showed both. So yeah, Dismembering here.

1819
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:34,000
So she's going to set us up. We get a guaranteed overpower. You do a bunch of damage. Sweet.

1820
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:37,000
That feeds into, you know, a lot of builds. And then we have Reprisal here.

1821
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:43,000
So I got chained by that monster. She leapt on them, knocked them down, basically canceling that for me.

1822
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Alright, cool. Subo the Bounty Hunter. He's themed on longbows, which is precision shooting and traps.

1823
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,000
The other side of his tree is crossbows, heavy bolts, and explosives.

1824
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:04,000
And his perk is kind of broken up into two parts. So he has a passive component, which is he reveals enemies and materials on the mini-map.

1825
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:10,000
And his active component is that he... We call him the Bounty Hunter because he's going to call out targets during combat.

1826
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:17,000
And if you kill that target, you get a bunch of resource back. And also, the more you do that, the more often he's going to be casting Seeker.

1827
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:23,000
So you're kind of trying to keep this up where you want to make sure you're killing his targets and spending your resource before you do so.

1828
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:27,000
And this lets you just cast more abilities, which always feels great.

1829
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Alright, let's check out an example. So I'm in town. I'm going to walk out here with Subo.

1830
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:39,000
And you can look at the mini-map, top right. And it's starting to populate with herbs and ore veins.

1831
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:44,000
And you'll see all the monsters on the mini-map as well. So that's kind of his scouting component.

1832
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:49,000
And... Sorry, we're going to have to loop this one because I talked too slowly.

1833
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,000
But he also is marking a target. And you saw when I killed them, I got a bunch of resource.

1834
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Yeah, I know a lot of people with Subo especially because the fact that he highlights like ore veins and things like that are pretty huge for people,

1835
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:13,000
especially with all the changes that we're adding to like how materials can also be used to maybe craft like legendaries and stuff.

1836
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,000
So Subo is kind of like my personal favorite.

1837
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:22,000
It definitely embraces, I think, what Brent was talking about too, where mercenaries are really about utility.

1838
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
And they kind of add choices that maybe you wouldn't necessarily pick on your character.

1839
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Or they help you just kind of like fill gaps in your build or maybe encourage you to do, you know, have more diversity in your build.

1840
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Maybe they expose new options for you. So it's pretty interesting.

1841
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Alright, cool. We're going to show off some Subo upgrades.

1842
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:45,000
So first we have Share a Drink, which is whenever he throws his Molotov, there's a chance for him to drop a healing potion for you.

1843
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Masterminds, Subo's Wiretrap and Tripmines gain 60% size.

1844
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:53,000
And then you and Subo both have increased crowd control duration.

1845
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Thrillseeker is going to reduce cooldowns for every monster hit.

1846
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:02,000
So here's an example of Share a Drink. He threw a Molotov, he dropped a potion for me.

1847
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:08,000
And that can just help you more consistently get potions, which could definitely be useful for a lot of players.

1848
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Alright, Oldkin. This is definitely a fan favorite. We call him the Forsaken Child.

1849
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:20,000
His tree is sort of split up into two magic types. Fire Magic, which is all about burning enemies and making them suffer.

1850
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:26,000
And Shadow Magic, which is haunting souls that kind of like apply dots and spread to enemies.

1851
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:31,000
His perk is dependent on what your skill tree choices are.

1852
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:36,000
So if you're on the fire side of the tree or the shadow, you will get different buffs and debuffs.

1853
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:39,000
So every once in a while he's going to turn into a demon of one of those forms.

1854
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:44,000
If he's on the shadow side, you and all the enemies around him become vulnerable.

1855
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:51,000
If he's on the fire side, he's going to make it so all your direct damage applies burn to enemies, but it's also draining your resource.

1856
02:36:51,000 --> 02:37:00,000
So he's really themed around this Kiss Curse mechanic and whenever this happens, it can be a huge benefit, but also there's some downsides to it potentially.

1857
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Alright, cool. So he's casting some fire skills. We're going to see Oldkin on the left. He's turning into a fire demon.

1858
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:09,000
This gives him a whole new skill set. He's got Immolation. He's burning nearby enemies and he's helping kill everything.

1859
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:14,000
And then you can see when I'm doing direct damage, it's applying burn, but also my resource is draining.

1860
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,000
This is if I'm on the shadow side. He turned into a shadow demon at the top.

1861
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:23,000
He's going to do a cool ability where he pulls everyone into a line, lines them up for you. That always feels really good.

1862
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:27,000
And yeah, in that one he's making everyone vulnerable.

1863
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Sweet! Let's talk about some upgrades for Oldkin.

1864
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,000
So I think this will be a lot of people's favorites.

1865
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Amber's Gift, whenever he casts Firestorm, if you stand in it, you're getting 33% of your primary resource per second.

1866
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:46,000
And we're going to show a video of that in a sec. Terrify, he does Haunt. Yeah, thank you.

1867
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:53,000
He's got a 30% chance to apply vulnerable to enemies, so another way to get keywords applied to things.

1868
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:57,000
And Burning Chaos, that's his ult. Whenever you cast your ult, it resets his.

1869
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Wave of Flame is really cool. It's this giant fire wave that destroys enemy projectiles.

1870
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:08,000
You can kind of like run with it and fight inside of it, and I've seen a lot of people get use out of that.

1871
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Cool! Okay, let's check out Ember's Gift.

1872
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:17,000
So he's going to cast Firestorm and look at my resource. It's just flying up really fast while I'm standing in this area.

1873
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:22,000
So it's a good way to kind of have this happen, and then you just get to spam a bunch of abilities.

1874
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
And Murder Monsters.

1875
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Yeah. So yeah, here's a quick example of, you know, we do have a lot of keywords and ways for mercenaries to utilize them and spread them to enemies.

1876
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
So that can help with a lot of builds too.

1877
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Yeah, it's nice having an option to add vulnerable to more enemies, especially like doing AOE or anything like that.

1878
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:50,000
So yeah, really cool to see. I know, of course, we have, there's other mechanics with mercenaries that we did want to talk about.

1879
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:53,000
So Dan, do you want to jump into how reinforcements actually works?

1880
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Yeah, let's talk about reinforcements.

1881
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:01,000
So I guess before I explain reinforcements, there are two methods of using mercenaries.

1882
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:04,000
One is hiring them, and that's for solo players.

1883
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:07,000
So if you're playing solo, you're not in a party, you can hire a mercenary.

1884
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Everyone at all times can also have a reinforcement.

1885
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,000
So if you're in a party, everyone has a reinforcement.

1886
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
If you're solo, you get both.

1887
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
And if you're playing solo, they have to be two different characters.

1888
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:21,000
So your hired mercenary has to be different from your reinforcement.

1889
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Alright, what the heck are reinforcements?

1890
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:28,000
So reinforcements are a new way to interact with mercs where you can kind of call a mercenary into battle,

1891
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:31,000
have them perform a skill at an opportune moment.

1892
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
And you get to sort of control when that happens.

1893
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:38,000
And this reminds me a lot of like old school fighting games where you can kind of cast an ability

1894
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,000
and a character will fly in off screen, he'll do something really cool.

1895
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
Hopefully that helps you a lot.

1896
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:46,000
And that's, you know, I think very much inspired by that.

1897
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Yeah, it's like assists.

1898
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:50,000
They jump in, they do something, and then they like pop back out.

1899
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,000
So it's really cool.

1900
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
So you're going to choose an opportunity, which is when does it happen?

1901
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:56,000
You could link this to any of your action bar slots.

1902
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:01,000
So you could say, hey, when I press one and I teleport, the mercenary does this skill.

1903
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:04,000
And then you choose a skill that you have unlocked for that mercenary.

1904
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Alright, let's check out some examples.

1905
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:07,000
So this one's quick.

1906
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
I'm going to cast teleport and you'll see Rahir appear.

1907
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
And then he sort of flies in battle.

1908
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,000
He does this triple slam.

1909
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,000
He groups everyone up.

1910
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Grouping enemies up is always good.

1911
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Thank you, Rahir.

1912
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
I drop a meteor on their head.

1913
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:23,000
In this one, we cast bone prison and oldkin shows up and casts firestorm for me.

1914
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:27,000
There's going to be a lot of combinations here, I think, with all the different player abilities

1915
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:30,000
and all the different reinforcement skills.

1916
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,000
So I think it'll be really interesting to see how players utilize the system.

1917
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:36,000
You can use it more defensively or more offensively.

1918
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:41,000
And hopefully you agree, a lot of the skills give you added utility.

1919
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:45,000
So I think there's a lot of opportunities here to mix and match, which would be cool.

1920
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Another thing I'm excited about that is that the system is built to grow.

1921
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:57,000
And so our ability to add more conditions in which you bring them in and continue to grow potentially powers that we can see too.

1922
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
It's a very robust system that can go a pretty long way.

1923
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:00,000
So it's great.

1924
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Yeah, cool.

1925
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Awesome.

1926
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:05,000
And I think finally we want to talk about some bartering.

1927
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Yeah, we're going to talk about rapport, which is the progression, and then bartering.

1928
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
But it's all tied together.

1929
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
It's all one unit.

1930
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,000
We're good.

1931
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Yeah, so rapport is the progression for mercenaries.

1932
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:19,000
And we could go ahead and jump to the first slide.

1933
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:22,000
So this is what the rapport looks like.

1934
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
You may be familiar with this type of UI.

1935
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
In this example, we're rank five.

1936
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:30,000
The first four skill ranks are how you get your skill points for the skill tree.

1937
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:35,000
We want you to unlock all the cool, fun abilities for mercs pretty quickly and upfront.

1938
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:38,000
After that point, it's all about upgrades for bartering.

1939
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
And bartering is, we're going to show it off in a second.

1940
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:48,000
But progressing your mercs improves the bartering system, which is kind of a way to trade with mercenaries at the hideout and get really useful items.

1941
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:52,000
So the very last rank, we hovered over it quickly there.

1942
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:57,000
You can actually repeat the very last rank for mercenaries and continue to earn the currency.

1943
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
So if you say, hey, I really like Ultkin.

1944
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
I don't want to level anyone else up.

1945
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:05,000
You could just keep playing this character and you'll keep getting resources.

1946
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Hopefully we're encouraging you, though, with these upgrades to kind of rank up all your mercs and keep making bartering better.

1947
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
All right, let's talk about bartering.

1948
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:21,000
So at the hideout, you can talk to Fiera and she will pull up a UI where you can trade for items.

1949
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:22,000
A lot of them are legendaries.

1950
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:28,000
And as you upgrade your mercs, you're going to basically increase this list so you can find more interesting things.

1951
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Hopefully you can find some really cool legendary items that you're excited about.

1952
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:35,000
As you upgrade your mercs, you're going to get more chances for legendaries.

1953
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:38,000
And each mercenary has an aspect category associated with them.

1954
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:45,000
So Ultkin, for example, gives you resource aspect caches.

1955
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
So if you level up Ultkin, that has a chance.

1956
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Instead of getting a resource legendary, you're going to get a resource legendary aspect cache.

1957
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
And in this case, we open one of those caches.

1958
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Sweet, I got a bunch of items.

1959
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:02,000
It's not exactly target farming, but it's a way to increase your chances of things you may be looking for.

1960
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:11,000
There's going to be a lot of other really useful items in here like crafting materials, boss summoning parts, some masterworking recipes, things like that.

1961
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
And that's about it.

1962
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
So you can re-stock the supply on this.

1963
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:22,000
And the currency you re-roll this inventory with is the same currency that you're spending to buy items.

1964
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:25,000
So you kind of have to pick and choose, like, do I want to re-roll or do I want to wait?

1965
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,000
And hopefully you see things that you're interested in and you buy them.

1966
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:32,000
And then every day when you log in, you get one free re-roll.

1967
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Just trying to be nice to the players.

1968
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Hopefully you get what you want without having to waste all your pale marks.

1969
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:41,000
And I think that's all we have for mercenaries today.

1970
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:42,000
So thank you for...

1971
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,000
That's awesome.

1972
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Yeah, I love hearing about the bartering system because it's just another avenue for, like,

1973
02:43:48,000 --> 02:44:00,000
hey, if I need master working materials or if I need boss summoning materials, I can literally go and check and see if I can barter for it now as another opportunity for getting those specific things, which is really, really cool to see.

1974
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:06,000
So, Dan, thank you very much for walking us through the mercenaries coming to Vessel of Hatred.

1975
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:12,000
And so everything that this group actually talked about here, this is all exclusive to Vessel of Hatred.

1976
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:24,000
So with the expansion and anyone who actually ends up purchasing the expansion, they'll be able to access all the different features that we talked about from Spiritborn to Curious Undercity to Dark Citadel and, of course, the mercenaries.

1977
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:34,000
So lots of stuff in the expansion specifically for this that we're all excited for everyone to jump into October 7th, 4 p.m. Pacific in California.

1978
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Globally, wherever your time zone is, that it's tied to that.

1979
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
That is when it will end up hitting.

1980
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
So we have a cool map.

1981
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Cool map.

1982
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:45,000
But I know we talked about a lot today.

1983
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:49,000
We do want to, of course, do our normal Q&A that we always do at the end.

1984
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:57,000
But before we actually end up doing that, I know, Brent, you wanted to talk a little bit about the journey here.

1985
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Yeah, honestly, you know, we talk at the team level a lot about our communication with the community at this point.

1986
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:08,000
And I've said it a few times where it's like it feels so good to be in a dialogue now.

1987
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:12,000
And everybody at home, you've heard us say, we're listening, we're listening.

1988
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:15,000
I actually feel like we're well beyond that point at this moment.

1989
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Like, we really feel like the community is now one of our team members.

1990
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
And we're developing together at this point.

1991
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:27,000
And we're starting to all pull in the same direction.

1992
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
And we've learned so much, right?

1993
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
We've come out with season one.

1994
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
We took some lumps there, right?

1995
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
We knew we had a lot of work to do.

1996
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:42,000
And all the dialogue that we've had has led up to things like the success of season four and season five.

1997
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:49,000
And so the fact that the community is really a part of our team now, it shows us a great pathway.

1998
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
We still have a lot of work to do.

1999
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
You know, there's things we want to get to.

2000
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Armory.

2001
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Yeah.

2002
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Armory.

2003
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Which is in development.

2004
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Yeah, so.

2005
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Armory.

2006
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:00,000
And we talked about that a little bit at Gamescom.

2007
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,000
But these are the types of things that are really fine tuning the way we can get there.

2008
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:07,000
And honestly, we couldn't get there without all of you at home.

2009
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
Thank you for staying with us on this journey.

2010
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Can't wait to get to the Q&A.

2011
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Yeah.

2012
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:24,000
And again, just to reiterate what Brent was saying, I think the community is speaking about how they really wanted us to have a PTR, having those PTR moments, having players in earlier, being able to provide that feedback.

2013
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Huge shout out to you guys for being able to help us out with this journey that we've been on.

2014
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:37,000
You know, we've made some massive strides since the first season and it's only getting better from here, which is really cool.

2015
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
So, awesome.

2016
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Well, I think we're going to jump into the Q&A.

2017
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:49,000
We're actually going to bring some people in from before, swap people out, do the musical chair thing again, musical chairs thing again.

2018
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
And we'll see you here in a minute for the Q&A.

2019
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:57,000
If you guys have questions, please start teeing them up and chat and we'll try to get to as many questions as possible.

2020
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,000
So we'll see you in a minute.

2021
02:46:58,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Yeah.

2022
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
We'll see you in a minute.

2023
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
We'll see you in a minute.

2024
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Bye.

2025
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Bye.

2026
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Bye.

2027
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Bye.

2028
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Bye.

2029
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Bye.

2030
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Bye.

2031
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Bye.

2032
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Bye.

2033
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Bye.

2034
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Bye.

2035
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Bye.

2036
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Bye.

2037
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Part 10 da conditional.

2038
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Bye.

2039
02:51:54,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Welcome back.

2040
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:05,000
All right, we're back for Q&A.

2041
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Welcome back, everyone.

2042
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Wave.

2043
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Bye.

2044
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:09,000
It's been a long stream.

2045
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:10,000
It's been a long stream.

2046
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:11,000
Holy cow we're at almost 2 1⁄2 hours.

2047
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:12,000
We're going to do about like 10 minutes of Q&A and then we'll have a quick littleoutro just

2048
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:15,000
to get everyone teed up before we head into Patch που's being released and, of course, the

2049
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:16,000
expansion.

2050
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:23,000
So I know we have some of our faces from earlier, so we can try to hit as many topics as possible.

2051
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:32,000
But I know one big question that we have been getting specifically about, or specifically with Vessel of Hatred and of course the base game.

2052
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:33,000
I think we have a queue to play.

2053
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:37,000
How will crossplay work for those playing with and without the expansion?

2054
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:44,000
This is actually a really good question because people are thinking like, oh, are you guys funneling them off?

2055
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Or like, if you only have Diablo 4, they just like shunned off to some island or something like that.

2056
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
And that is not the case.

2057
02:52:51,000 --> 02:53:00,000
You can still play with friends who may only have the base game even if they're on Xbox and your PC or PlayStation and PC, etc, etc.

2058
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
So there is that option.

2059
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:13,000
What's also kind of cool is an interaction that I know that if let's say you owned it on PC Battle.net, for instance, and then for Vessel of Hatred,

2060
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:19,000
but then the base game was only on Xbox for your own personal Xbox and you jump back over to your Xbox.

2061
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:26,000
If you have like rune words on your sort, for instance, you still can actually use those rune words.

2062
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:27,000
Everything works still.

2063
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:27,000
Yeah.

2064
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
So it's still something that's going to be there.

2065
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:38,000
I know that one of the things that the team was looking at was like, hey, if you earned it in the other game, you can still use it.

2066
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:46,000
So it's more so the things within Vessel of Hatred like Spiritborn or the region of Nihantu.

2067
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Those things just wouldn't be available for that base game user or if you jumped over onto the base game.

2068
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Yeah.

2069
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
That's also why we gave everyone the 10 levels.

2070
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:57,000
We want everyone to be able to play with each other.

2071
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Everyone is going to be able to be at the same eye power, all that good stuff.

2072
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Yeah.

2073
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:05,000
So it's a cool little like extra thing for people.

2074
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:09,000
And I know it does clarify a lot specifically on that.

2075
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:16,000
This was probably the biggest thing that people asked about during PTR.

2076
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:22,000
And so Brent, this is from Razzle Dazzle Daris.

2077
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:24,000
This is actually from a lot of people.

2078
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Speaking of D2, I'm wearing my D2 jacket.

2079
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Will we get the D4 campfire screen back?

2080
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:38,000
So we were talking about it during the interstitial just a little bit.

2081
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Yeah, I think if we could feel a vibe through a monitor, that was the moment that came through.

2082
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
We hear it loud and clear.

2083
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:55,000
One of the things that we are doing is trying to set ourselves up for success for adding more classes to the mix.

2084
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:01,000
And so the campfire is one of those things where we're taking a look at it and trying to figure out how that would work.

2085
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:07,000
And so we updated it where we are kind of like really in and you don't get that initial setup.

2086
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:15,000
So that is something that like immediately when the feedback started coming through, the team started to mobilize and talk about what we can do.

2087
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:23,000
Turning it around in time fast enough for like Vessel of Hatred was we had other things like balance and polish that we really wanted to pay attention to.

2088
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Make sure some of the UI elements for some of the new features were in a good spot.

2089
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:28,000
So we hear you.

2090
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:33,000
I love the fact that the nostalgia means so much.

2091
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:38,000
And so the team is actively talking about it and we'll be able to get back to you in the future.

2092
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:39,000
Awesome.

2093
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Yeah, that was by far a very, very popular topic after PTR.

2094
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:46,000
They're like, where's the campfire?

2095
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Every moment we learn.

2096
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
I can see like the flames kind of like in the screen.

2097
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
But where is like the full on campfire?

2098
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Yeah.

2099
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:59,000
We have a question from Ram Zero, which is, will there be more renown in statues of Lilith in this expansion?

2100
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
How does that specifically work?

2101
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:04,000
Yeah, we're not going to be doing statues of Lilith specifically.

2102
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:08,000
We're going to be having a new statue type.

2103
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
The Tenant of Akurat.

2104
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:16,000
Tenant of Akurat, which is, it's not going to give you any points, but it is working towards renown.

2105
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:22,000
And so there's still a lot of discoverability in the zone, but we're shifting things to work more for renown.

2106
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Yeah.

2107
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:26,000
And statues of Lilith, of course, are still in.

2108
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:26,000
They still exist.

2109
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:27,000
They're still in the base.

2110
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Thank you for clarifying.

2111
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Yeah.

2112
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:37,000
The stats, we're just not giving stats for the Tenant of Akurat because we saw how frustrated players were with like having to do this sort of activity to get more powerful.

2113
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Correct.

2114
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Yeah.

2115
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
So it's a lot more leaning into the collectible aspect.

2116
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Yeah.

2117
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Yeah.

2118
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:43,000
We didn't want these to feel like a chore that you needed to do in order to progress your player power.

2119
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:45,000
It's all about the discoverability, right?

2120
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Yeah.

2121
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:47,000
In the new zone.

2122
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Yeah.

2123
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Agreed.

2124
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:54,000
And I will say that the other thing with renown specifically, like we made changes.

2125
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:59,000
It's something we talked about during the PTR, but we kind of optimized it a little bit better.

2126
02:56:59,000 --> 02:56:59,000
We did.

2127
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Because there was like paragon points at the last tier of renown, and that's actually been like swapped back around now.

2128
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
So it's more like the oval upgrades are at the last tier.

2129
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
It's easier to get that potent power from paragon.

2130
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:14,000
We also just sort of reduced how much renown you need for a lot of these things.

2131
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:18,000
So if you missed out on renown when the game came out, it's a lot easier to get that power.

2132
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Yeah.

2133
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:24,000
It's a good way for people, like especially friends who maybe are jumping into DM before just to like kind of catch up specifically.

2134
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
From that end.

2135
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:37,000
One thing this just dawned on me that I did want to also mention is that, you know, back in season three, we introduced the gauntlet.

2136
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:40,000
And that has, you know, the leaderboard mechanics and stuff like that.

2137
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:46,000
One thing I do want to actually do a quick call out on is like when season six starts and when Vessel of Hatred actually does ship.

2138
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:52,000
We do plan on actually sunsetting the gauntlet and the leaderboard functionality there.

2139
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Does that mean leaderboards are going away forever?

2140
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
No, that doesn't mean leaderboards are going away forever.

2141
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:00,000
We're actually looking at new ways of potentially finding a home for it.

2142
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Yeah.

2143
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
I'd rather say like leaderboards are vaulted.

2144
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Yeah.

2145
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:11,000
As we do a big reassessment on how that applies to the new progression actually we're looking at releasing with season six.

2146
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:14,000
So I think that there's a lot of opportunity there.

2147
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
But again, we've made so much change.

2148
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:21,000
It's a time to take a deep breath and then take a look at the things that we really want to invest into.

2149
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Yeah.

2150
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Awesome.

2151
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Almost forgot about that.

2152
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:25,000
I wanted to mention that.

2153
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:30,000
There's a question from audience which is saying like, hey, how does group finder work?

2154
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:35,000
This was actually available during PTR and I know not everyone got to experience PTR.

2155
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:43,000
But kind of like party finder itself, of course, you can use it across multitudes of activities from dark citadel beyond dark citadel,

2156
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
which is being introduced in vessel of hatred.

2157
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:56,000
But it is a feature that you can also use or that allows you to actually use filters and different ways of searching for specific groups and people.

2158
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:01,000
So we do recommend jumping in, checking out the party finder.

2159
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
It's actually super, super awesome.

2160
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:06,000
And I know there's going to be improvements that will continuously be made to it.

2161
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Yeah.

2162
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:10,000
Another system that we're trying to develop in a way that can grow with the player.

2163
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:16,000
And so we got it out in PTR to try to get an initial round of feedback on the types of filters that we could potentially see.

2164
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:21,000
You know, as we add activities to the game, we want to make sure that those are plugging into it as well.

2165
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:25,000
We do think that this game is a ton of fun if you're playing together.

2166
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
And so we've designed it to do exactly that.

2167
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:33,000
We have a question regarding opals and tributes that we kind of showed off.

2168
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Tributes, of course, being part of Curious Under City, opals being part of the new season.

2169
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,000
This question was from PVE Sweat.

2170
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Great.

2171
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:46,000
That should be a title.

2172
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:53,000
I think the initial reaction is seeing some of these new consumables.

2173
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
So, Tim, I think this would be a question for you.

2174
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Like, seeing these new consumables, are they actually, like, stackable in inventory?

2175
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2176
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:01,000
You can stack them in inventory.

2177
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
In fact, if you want, you have the option.

2178
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:07,000
You can go just farm the Realm Walker over and over again, get a whole bunch of the opals,

2179
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:12,000
and then just, okay, I'm going to play now for hours and hours with the buff active,

2180
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:13,000
if that's something you want to do.

2181
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
And tributes as well are stackable.

2182
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:16,000
Awesome.

2183
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:19,000
I did like the fact, too, I don't know, I can't recall if we mentioned it,

2184
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
but you get two tributes with every drop.

2185
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Yes.

2186
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:23,000
And so you don't...

2187
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:24,000
Sorry, two opals.

2188
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Two opals, sorry.

2189
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Yeah.

2190
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:30,000
So you can, like, use one now and save one for later, and so you can really determine,

2191
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:34,000
like, you can actually stack these up for a longer play session later on if you wanted

2192
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:37,000
to play in the weekend and actually really dig in.

2193
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:41,000
There is a question regarding Mercenaries.

2194
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:42,000
It's actually a question I've seen.

2195
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:51,000
Maybe it's a two-parter, but a lot of people are asking specifically, like, hey, do Mercenaries...

2196
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
How does the progression of Mercenaries kind of carry over?

2197
03:00:54,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Is it something that's across, like, the whole entire account, or is it, like, from season to season?

2198
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:01,000
How does that specifically work?

2199
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Yeah, so they're partition-wide, so if you're playing in the season and you unlock the Mercs

2200
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:12,000
and you progress a bunch of them and then you roll an alt, that progression is still there.

2201
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:17,000
But we do reset every season because it's a part of the power journey, and we want to

2202
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:18,000
make sure you're doing that.

2203
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:22,000
But as you're playing, there's a lot of benefits to investing into them, especially if you're

2204
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:23,000
going to roll a second class.

2205
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:26,000
There is a question.

2206
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:32,000
I'm not sure if others will be able to get this one, but this might be tied to some of

2207
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:41,000
the rune word stuff that we showed, but this is GodKingMunin says, how do those spirit wolves

2208
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
damage scaling work?

2209
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:48,000
I think they're talking specifically about the rune words that we were showing and everything

2210
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,000
like that.

2211
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
Yeah, I can talk a bit about that.

2212
03:01:52,000 --> 03:02:01,000
I believe the spirit wolves are not currently scaling with things like if you have summoning

2213
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:02,000
damage for a necromancer.

2214
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:08,000
A lot of that damage scaling talks directly to your skeleton summons at the moment, so I

2215
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:11,000
don't believe they'll necessarily scale with those sources.

2216
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:15,000
I'd have to check on precisely which ones it does.

2217
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:20,000
But that's definitely something that we're aware of and really want to make sure that

2218
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:25,000
we can deliver on that fantasy, and we'll be looking at making updates to minions and

2219
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:30,000
summons as a general matter going forward to really make sure that they're scaling with

2220
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:36,000
the right things that players expect to really make those builds feel natural and synergistic

2221
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
as you would expect.

2222
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
So that's definitely an area of focus for us moving forward.

2223
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
Yeah, we definitely have talked a lot about this.

2224
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:47,000
It'd be cool if you could be a summoner barb called Ancients and having them deal bulkier

2225
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:48,000
damage.

2226
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
That's something we definitely talk a lot about.

2227
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Yeah, we don't have any particular thing to announce or the exact initiative at this

2228
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:58,000
moment, but it's definitely on our radar and it's something we are actively working

2229
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
on and talking about all the time.

2230
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Awesome.

2231
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:04,000
I know that I am the berm.

2232
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:09,000
I asked this back to Tim actually because I think you had mentioned like, oh, farming

2233
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:12,000
realm walkers and they're going like, okay, so is it a world event?

2234
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
How often does it spawn?

2235
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Like what?

2236
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Like do we have like specifics on that?

2237
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
We can help clarify on that specific question.

2238
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:20,000
It is a world event.

2239
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:21,000
Yeah.

2240
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
We're focused around just that boss.

2241
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:24,000
It's not a world boss.

2242
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:25,000
Exactly.

2243
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:26,000
It is a world event.

2244
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:31,000
Like was explained by Don earlier in the cast, you have to kind of follow him for a while

2245
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
before you're allowed to kill him.

2246
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:36,000
But it is something that you do with other people in the area.

2247
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:39,000
There's likely to be a bunch of other people helping you take down this boss.

2248
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:44,000
And then the realm walker itself does pop up in another location in Sanctuary pretty

2249
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:45,000
much right away.

2250
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:49,000
So it's a slight break, but at any given time we want the experience to be I log in,

2251
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:50,000
I'm ready to go play.

2252
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
I see like, I don't have any opals.

2253
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,000
Can I go get some?

2254
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:54,000
We want the answer to pretty much always be yes.

2255
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Like there's always a realm walker up somewhere that you can go kill.

2256
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:02,000
So I guess you can get slightly unlucky like he just died, but you're not waiting more

2257
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:05,000
than a few minutes before another one is going to pop up and you can go kill that

2258
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:06,000
one.

2259
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,000
So if you want to chain farm them, you can.

2260
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
Yeah, just run back to town vendor some stuff.

2261
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:13,000
By the time you come back, it will probably be like, you know, an ideal time to actually farm it.

2262
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:17,000
So it's actually really good to hear that it's just always available for players pretty

2263
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:20,000
or nearly always available for players.

2264
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
Question from Plucky Villain for season six on live.

2265
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:29,000
Like from a tuning and balance perspective, is pit 100 still intended to be like that unobtainable

2266
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:34,000
goal or is there are we expecting some of like the most skilled players and dedicated players

2267
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
to kind of clear it?

2268
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:41,000
Yeah, I'd say we will be surprised, but not surprised, I guess, to see people get to pit

2269
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:44,000
tier 100 just with the amount of things that we're adding into the game.

2270
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:48,000
Charles, you know, in our previous segment talked about how much volatility has been introduced

2271
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:49,000
in the expansion.

2272
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
We actually think that's really fun.

2273
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Like there's a ton of new things to explore, a ton of new things to break.

2274
03:04:56,000 --> 03:05:01,000
And we think that probably most people won't get to 100, but you might get a surprise if

2275
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
you go to 100 and go past it.

2276
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:04,000
Yeah.

2277
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
We might have done something there.

2278
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:09,000
Yeah, we talked quite a bit about where the deep end of the pool is, right?

2279
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
It's around 80.

2280
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:12,000
Around 80.

2281
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Yeah.

2282
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:17,000
But yeah, I'm really looking forward to seeing which kind of streamers out there actually

2283
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
push way past that so we can take a look.

2284
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:20,000
Definitely.

2285
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:25,000
YourSparrow asks, if we complete the campaign in Eternal Realm, will we be able to skip it

2286
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:26,000
when we create a seasonal character?

2287
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:27,000
Yes.

2288
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:30,000
As soon as you complete the campaign for the first time, you'll be able to skip it.

2289
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
Very similar to what we did in the base game.

2290
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:37,000
Yeah, and I think there's actually additional nuances that we've added with Vessel of Hatred.

2291
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:43,000
For instance, if you are brand new to Diablo, of course we recommend you start from the base

2292
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:46,000
game and experience the campaign and that journey.

2293
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:53,000
But even if you are coming into Diablo 4 with Vessel of Hatred and you just want to start

2294
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:58,000
with Vessel of Hatred, you really just need to complete that prologue of the base game.

2295
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:01,000
And then you will then get that option, I believe, to skip the base campaign and you

2296
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:05,000
can actually jump into the expansion campaign.

2297
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:06,000
Yeah.

2298
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:07,000
You actually don't even have to complete the prologue.

2299
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:08,000
Oh, there we go.

2300
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,000
You even took out that part.

2301
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:10,000
You're a liar, Adam.

2302
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:11,000
You're a liar.

2303
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
And we've taken great care of you too.

2304
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:20,000
So like if you're new and you skip forward, when you go to go into Vessel of Hatred, we

2305
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:21,000
actually do recaps.

2306
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:24,000
So we'll catch up on the story even if you decide to do it.

2307
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:27,000
So if your friends are all way ahead of you and you want to skip so that you can catch

2308
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
up, you're good.

2309
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:30,000
Yeah.

2310
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:33,000
We got one of those like in the last episode of whatever.

2311
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Yeah.

2312
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:35,000
It's really good.

2313
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:36,000
It's actually really cool to watch.

2314
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:37,000
So just in case you're new to everything.

2315
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:43,000
There's another detail too, which is like once you play through the Vessel of Hatred story

2316
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:47,000
section, we want way more players to get into the end game.

2317
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:52,000
We noticed that there's a lot of folks out there that once they get the big story beats

2318
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:56,000
done, it's not really clear on where to go from there.

2319
03:06:56,000 --> 03:07:00,000
And so we created a custom quest that can actually bridge you out into the end game.

2320
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:05,000
And so if you can continue following your golden baubles, that would be super good.

2321
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:06,000
Cool.

2322
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:07,000
Awesome.

2323
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:10,000
I'm looking at the sign in the peanut gallery.

2324
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:11,000
Yeah.

2325
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:12,000
I'm looking at it.

2326
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:13,000
Oh.

2327
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:14,000
I was stuck.

2328
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:15,000
I was like, what is pretty?

2329
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:16,000
No one can see it, obviously.

2330
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:19,000
They think we're psycho because we're like looking back on what's going on.

2331
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
The coolest view is behind this camera.

2332
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Production's like holding up the sign and stuff.

2333
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:24,000
Everybody that makes us look good is back there.

2334
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:25,000
So thank you guys.

2335
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:26,000
Yes.

2336
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Thank you very much.

2337
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:31,000
We're going to take, I guess, like one more specific question here.

2338
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Let me see.

2339
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:40,000
This is actually a question regarding people that are running specifically in Dark Citadel.

2340
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:45,000
Like if someone leaves during Dark Citadel, like what happens to the group specifically?

2341
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:46,000
Can they all just leave?

2342
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:51,000
They're not like locked in there going like, oh gosh, I'm stuck in that type of situation.

2343
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:59,000
Or if I can conquer it with like maybe if it's four people and we dropped to three, like you can adapt and kind of work your way through it?

2344
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:00,000
You can.

2345
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:04,000
Like we said, the Citadel is balanced for four.

2346
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:09,000
But if that was to drop, as long as you got two strong players still in the mix, you should be good to go.

2347
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
So yes, it makes it more difficult.

2348
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:15,000
I'd have a firm conversation with the person who decided to drop in the middle of a fight.

2349
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:20,000
But yeah, you're still going to be able to progress through it.

2350
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:21,000
Awesome.

2351
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Cool.

2352
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:29,000
Well, I know we've been going for a while here and we wanted to grab as many questions as possible so we don't keep people too long.

2353
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:33,000
Because the biggest thing as well is like after at the end of the stream we are releasing the patch notes.

2354
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
And I know a lot of people want to dive into the patch notes.

2355
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:43,000
But I guess before we kind of drop off, like Brent, I know you wanted to give a quick message out as well.

2356
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:50,000
Yeah, you know, we saw this really cool piece of art that was made by one of our art directors on the team.

2357
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:57,000
And it just really reminded us that there are hundreds of people working on this game all of the time.

2358
03:08:57,000 --> 03:09:08,000
And these live streams are for our community, but it's also for all the folks who have been working tirelessly over the last dozens of months on trying to make this a reality.

2359
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:11,000
And so we just want to say thank you to everybody that's putting the hard work in.

2360
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:14,000
We're still putting the hard work in today.

2361
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000
Like we're working all the way up through this.

2362
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:17,000
And so we love the team.

2363
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:18,000
We love you guys.

2364
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:19,000
Keep up the good work.

2365
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:23,000
And yeah, we'll see you on the other side of October 8th.

2366
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:24,000
October 8th.

2367
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Yeah.

2368
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
A huge shout out to Team 3, Team Diablo.

2369
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:28,000
You guys kick ass.

2370
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:29,000
Yeah.

2371
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:30,000
Best team.

2372
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:33,000
We're super proud of everyone with a vessel of hatred and everything.

2373
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:36,000
And we're super excited for October 8th.

2374
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:37,000
There's a lot of stuff coming up.

2375
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:40,000
We have patch notes immediately after this stream.

2376
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:45,000
I want to give a huge shout out to everyone here and of course who was on the live stream today.

2377
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
It's always fun doing these live streams.

2378
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:48,000
It's a big scramble.

2379
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:52,000
This is the most amount of people we've ever had on a live stream.

2380
03:09:52,000 --> 03:10:01,000
So huge shout out to our production team and of course our community team like with Mr. Filthy Rich back there who organizes all these great...

2381
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
That's his handle guys.

2382
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:06,000
Who handles, who handles, handles haha.

2383
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:08,000
All these specific streams every single time.

2384
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:10,000
This is our 20th stream.

2385
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
It's crazy to see how everything has grown.

2386
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:13,000
Big reminders on Twitch drops.

2387
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:15,000
We have all the information on Diablo4.com.

2388
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:18,000
Twitch drops will actually start on October 8th.

2389
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:26,000
And if you're in the US you can grab trolleys and grab more in-game stuff as I eat trolleys all day.

2390
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:29,000
And then another big thing that I do want to give a quick call out.

2391
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:34,000
In the coming days you guys are actually going to hear about another cool partnership we're doing with Discord.

2392
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:38,000
Which will offer up another opportunity for some cool in-game stuff.

2393
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:41,000
So, and you'll be talking about that here in the coming days.

2394
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:46,000
But, thank you guys again for tuning in to our pre-launch stream.

2395
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:50,000
Lots of stuff to check out in the patch notes immediately after the stream.

2396
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:53,000
And again, a huge thanks to everyone here.

2397
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:57,000
We will see you guys October 8th in Nihantu.

2398
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:00,000
We're excited and we can't wait to jump into Vessel of Hatred.

2399
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:01,000
We'll see you guys.

2400
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:02,000
We'll see you guys.

2401
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:40,000
We'll see you guys next time.

2402
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:44,000
We'll see you next time.

2403
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,000
You guys next time.

2404
03:11:46,000 --> 03:12:15,000
Thank you.

2405
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:45,000
Thank you.
