1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
just hang out how you were doing buddy

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:56,000
he

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Can I ask you guys a question?

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Do you guys ever wake up in the morning and ask yourselves, why am I not playing Elden

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ring?

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Every morning.

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He's locked in, chat.

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Two bits, how we don't button.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You weren't a fan of Elden Ring really?

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You weren't a fan of Elden Ring really?

11
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will.

12
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you guys did not know, Riker did an interview yesterday.

13
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He asked a lot of really good questions, but I have a lot of follow-up questions for

14
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
the questions that he asked.

15
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I promised people that I would take questions from YouTube.

16
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Someone already kind of answered.

17
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll give you all the answers.

18
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's on our radar.

19
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I want to get inside the minds of the devs.

20
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I want to know their approach to things.

21
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't want to know.

22
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not going to ask yes or no questions.

23
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When can we say builds?

24
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I think they already answered that.

25
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They said that they like the idea of an armory.

26
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They like the idea of an armory.

27
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It wasn't the top priority for them to get into the game, but maybe I can reiterate that

28
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,000
it was the top question.

29
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Was it CP Max 205 or something?

30
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And then Sergeant Turtle III.

31
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Every single one of these questions I already had on my list except this one.

32
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Are there questions related to end game improvement?

33
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I guess I can walk you guys through my questions that I have so far.

34
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You would be shocked.

35
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I actually spent a lot of time on this.

36
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm trying to be as prepared as possible.

37
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm going to need to clean this up and potentially grab more questions from you guys.

38
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm actually let me let me change my mind.

39
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let me do a little bit more work here and then I'll ask you.

40
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's not quite complete yet.

41
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So they talked about set items yesterday.

42
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They said that set items are fan favorite.

43
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They said that there is, if you think about a character's power, it's a slice of pizza.

44
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A slice goes to skills and paragon and unique and aspects and the athixes and whatever.

45
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If sets come into the game, then it's going to take up a slice of the pizza.

46
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How much of the pizza should it take is what they were talking about.

47
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So one thing that they said is there's no point to implement set items if they're too weak.

48
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I strongly agree here.

49
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Look at the super shitty sets.

50
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I love pizza.

51
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's what I took it from as well.

52
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's what I took from it as well.

53
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you look at last epoch, for example, they release sets.

54
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They're completely worthless.

55
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I actually just filter out set items in my loot filter.

56
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I just filter them out.

57
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
A lot of them in Diablo 2, you find a lot of low level set items.

58
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They're useless.

59
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You just go into the black marsh.

60
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You get your, what's it called, your stealth.

61
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Then you make your two spirit items and we ain't got no time for any of these sets.

62
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But they also said Diablo 3, too strong and I agree.

63
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So the thing that I wanted to ask them about is if set items come into the game, where

64
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:41,000
do they feel is the right amount of power and item slots taken.

65
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I can give them three examples of sets that I think work beautifully.

66
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:01,000
In Diablo 3, a good example of a set is maybe Captain Crimson's, Ogild's and Guardians.

67
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They barely take up any slots and they have different use cases.

68
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So Guardians is for early game.

69
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Captain Crimson's is if you want cool down and Ogild's is if you want damage.

70
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And another really good example in my opinion is Diablo 2's Talorasha set.

71
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And the reason why is it's an end game godly set but not game breaking.

72
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And two pieces are very rare but not impossible to find the amulet and the chest.

73
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The chest is super difficult but the amulet is very accessible.

74
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is my example of the three best sets I've ever seen in a game.

75
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Do you guys agree that these sets are well designed?

76
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't break the game and add some flavor to the game.

77
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Can you move away from turning D4 into D2 and D3 questions?

78
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Df, I got four pages of questions here.

79
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I got four pages.

80
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm asking questions about Diablo 4.

81
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The questions are about Diablo 4 but I will draw analogies to many other games.

82
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I even have a question about Diablo 4 specific unique ideas.

83
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I've put in a shitload of effort into this document man.

84
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Trust me.

85
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm not talking about the other games but we can bring up tons of analogies to other

86
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
games.

87
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There was an interview yesterday from Riker.

88
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We're going to talk about that.

89
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Here's my question on rumors.

90
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
They said yesterday that they like rune words and they see a future.

91
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:39,000
They initially had rune words coming in but they didn't have time to finish them.

92
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But here's the problem.

93
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Here's the thing for me about rune words.

94
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Rune words to me again is an iconic system.

95
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Iconic system of D2.

96
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But the announcement that they had for rune words wasn't rune words.

97
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It was like a prefix and a suffix and it was like a totally new system with the same

98
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
name.

99
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:51,000
My question is when the team talks about the work that you've already done on rune words,

100
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:20,000
is it an improvement or an expansion?

101
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:33,000
On the original rune word system or is it something with a different direction?

102
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This is the thing that threw off the community the most when they initially announced this.

103
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They said rune words are coming to Diablo 4 and then they showed us what it looked like

104
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and it wasn't rune words at all.

105
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So I want to know, it sounds like it may be coming sometime in the future.

106
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If it comes in the future, are you starting with kind of Diablo 2's base of that system

107
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and expanding upon it and changing it and making it work in Diablo 4 universe?

108
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Are you actually going to give us something different?

109
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The interviews in one hour exactly.

110
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
On Rikers interview, they took 15 minutes answering each question.

111
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, I watched Rikers interview for three times over.

112
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I watched it three times.

113
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm pretty, I would like to think hopefully this is true.

114
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'd like to think I'm pretty prepared today.

115
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I watched it three times.

116
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's why the title of this is CJ's questions in the beginning.

117
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I want to, and I messaged Blizzard.

118
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I said, I would like to continue some of the conversations that you guys had.

119
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The interviews in one hour, guys, one hour.

120
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They did, they talked about all of these.

121
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
They talked about all of these and Rikers interviews, guys.

122
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I know.

123
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I watched it three times.

124
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I know.

125
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I have a different question.

126
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Riker asked, are rune words coming in Diablo 4 and their answer was they like rune words

127
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and they see a future in Diablo 4?

128
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's not my question.

129
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
My question is, when rune words come to Diablo 4, are they going to be rune words or are

130
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
they going to be something different because when they initially announced it, it was something

131
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
different.

132
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's why I want to talk about it, Caramon.

133
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's why it's my first question.

134
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's exactly why it's up here.

135
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
They talked about aspirational and pinnacle content like three different times.

136
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So...

137
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, yeah, both.

138
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It would be both.

139
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay, charms.

140
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Let's say last epoch, we get art.

141
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So PoE, D3, don't have them.

142
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:44,000
D2 has them with no dedicated inventory.

143
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Last epoch has them with a dedicated inventory.

144
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Will they ever come to D4?

145
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If yes, would they have a dedicated inventory?

146
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I already have that as a question, Luna.

147
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
When is Diablo coming to Diablo 4?

148
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If Joe is smart, he would be in the chat taking notes to prepare.

149
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So let me clarify the situation here, guys.

150
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Never actually individually or one-on-one too much, but I have been talking to Borgio

151
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and Adam.

152
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Me and Joe and Adam had a lengthy conversation about how great Elden Ring is and how all

153
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
great all the Souls games are.

154
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
By the way, I think both Joe and Adam beat every single Souls game.

155
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Bloodborne, all three of the Dark Souls and Elden Ring.

156
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So they're gamers, right?

157
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I am not going into this interview with a machine gun looking for blood, right?

158
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I am not looking to embarrass them.

159
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm not looking to put uneasy pressure on them.

160
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What I want to do is I would just like to get some answers for the public on the most pressing

161
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
questions, right?

162
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I want to know what is in their minds and on the team's minds for the future of the game.

163
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So that way we can estimate what we are going to be getting out of Diablo 4.

164
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Like honestly, I think this interview might have some impact for some people on whether

165
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
they'd buy the expansion or not.

166
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Because if people like what they're hearing about the future of Diablo 4, maybe they

167
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
will have more confidence in purchasing the expansion.

168
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You know what I mean?

169
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This interview is not my personal opportunity to get answers to these questions.

170
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This interview is to go out in public with a bunch of lovely people like yourselves and

171
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
ask them some deep questions and see so you everyone else can hear all the answers.

172
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So I'm not going in here for looking for blood necessarily.

173
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You lost 10 million ruins today.

174
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Can't you just go pick them up though?

175
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Maybe just some bruising.

176
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Any question regarding PVP?

177
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I know.

178
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Let's put this in here.

179
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Could ask that.

180
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Give me a second here.

181
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Rob sent me a message and said, racks, if you can squeeze these two questions and get

182
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
them in.

183
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So let's try to ask them.

184
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah.

185
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Let's go up here for a second.

186
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Right.

187
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You got five questions in.

188
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Well, I have one, two, three, four, five, six.

189
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I have six, well, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

190
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I have seven questions that came directly from CJ's interview, follow-ups to questions

191
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
that CJ asked.

192
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And then I have two other additional things and then I have many, many.

193
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Here's another five questions.

194
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I really want to know this.

195
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
A lot of people in the community say, Blizzard never tests anything that they do.

196
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
They just throw stuff into the game.

197
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We are the beta testers.

198
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I think people deep down know that that is not true.

199
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So I would like to know how does testing work for Blizzard?

200
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You have an idea for something.

201
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Oh, we're going to do the avatar.

202
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You put together the monsters and the layouts and maybe you get it into a testing phase.

203
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Then what happens?

204
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:53,000
What is the internal process for testing?

205
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Another question that I wanted to ask at some point, I can delete all of this.

206
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Another question I wanted to ask is Microsoft's impact.

207
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I don't really know though because the problem with this kind of a question, the impact on game

208
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
development, here's the problem though.

209
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Let's, I don't know if we're ever going to get, I don't know if we're ever going to

210
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
get an answer here because if Microsoft negatively impacted their development, they would

211
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
never say it.

212
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
They wouldn't, they would, like, they're either going to say Microsoft is great.

213
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
We love them or that's not true and they're not going to, and they're not going to answer

214
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
it.

215
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I guess we could ask it a different way though that's not offensive.

216
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Maybe we could say the Microsoft takeover and then I guess we could ask them, have they

217
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
mostly been hands on helping you guys, providing resources, providing guidance, or are they

218
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
very hands off letting you guys do your thing?

219
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:43,000
They trust you or is it kind of like a mixture?

220
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
There's two people, they already said the Microsoft impact is positive, they already said that

221
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Microsoft is hands off, not even the internet can agree.

222
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay, hey CJ, can I call you CJ is here?

223
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Wait a minute.

224
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Can I, do you want to chat on Discord for a second?

225
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I watched your interview three times by the way.

226
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay, you called me CJ, you called me.

227
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Okay, CJ is here.

228
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
We turn off the music, guys.

229
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Remind me to turn it on like CJ is Riker.

230
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Let me message him.

231
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Hmm.

232
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:59,000
This will also give me a good chance to test my Discord audio here.

233
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Hello, hello, can you hear me?

234
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Hey Ryan, how you doing?

235
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yo, can you get, okay, he's got to be too low, right?

236
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I turned him way up, can you give me another one?

237
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Here CJ.

238
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Jank 1, 2, testing 1, 2.

239
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
How's the volume there, guys?

240
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Up, down or perfect?

241
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, I'm actually getting every answer.

242
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Okay, let's go up slightly more.

243
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Last try one more time.

244
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Jank 1, 2.

245
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It could also be maybe I'm a little on the low side.

246
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
How's that?

247
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Okay, we're good.

248
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Hey man, I watched your interview yesterday.

249
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't know man, you have like a flow, like you've done this before, you have like a

250
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
flow to the conversation that I don't think I'm going to be able to match man.

251
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm just rough around the edges, I'm just diving right in, man.

252
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Now you're going to have a different style and I think it's going to be really good that

253
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
we're each going to have like different kinds of interviews that are going to get different

254
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
kinds of answers.

255
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Like there are some questions that, because we did like, I kind of what you're going

256
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
to do in here, we're getting some questions from the audience and I'm like, that's a

257
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
big question.

258
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You guys can go ask that tomorrow, where I know it's a bit more granular, it's a bit more

259
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
on point.

260
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So yeah, no, I think I'm excited to see you, because you also have Adam Jackson, right?

261
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
They're bringing in, they know what to expect from you.

262
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So I'm bringing Adam Jackson to cover those really specific class talking points.

263
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh God, I don't even want to know what that means.

264
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah, so I watched your interview, I really liked it.

265
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Again, I added another page and a half of follow up questions to your questions.

266
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Your questions were good, but yeah, I guess with my questions like listening to how you

267
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
brought them up, I have some like very, very pointed questions like, how do you feel

268
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
about this?

269
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I guess two questions for you.

270
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
How did you feel about the interview in general and was there any really pressing thing that

271
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
you wanted to get out of your interview that you didn't have time for that you want me

272
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
to revisit today?

273
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh, that's a great question.

274
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I mean, I got through maybe half of the questions.

275
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I was like triaging them as I was going through them just because I was happy with the interview

276
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
overall.

277
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I recognized that I asked some big questions, especially up front that necessitated very

278
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
long answers.

279
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And that's something I need to think about going forward is being able to maybe pepper

280
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
in the smaller questions up front that can give smaller answers just to get more in there.

281
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Like I would have loved to have hours to talk with you and get through everything and

282
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
also ask those follow up questions and stuff.

283
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But I know the Microsoft one was something that was high up on the list.

284
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I don't know, like I was hearing your concerns and I had this, I was going through that same

285
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
theory crafting of what can they answer, what are they going to answer?

286
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So yeah, possibly one way of framing it would be what if anything has the deal with Microsoft

287
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
a lot of you guys to do now that you couldn't do before because obviously they're not going

288
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
to, you know, crap talk Microsoft.

289
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But it's kind of one way to see if there are days being impacted at all by this kind of

290
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
stuff.

291
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Okay, keep going.

292
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
What else what else would you have asked is good.

293
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Let's see.

294
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
One answer that would have been a big, I skipped it because it would have been another big

295
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
answer being, well, what's like the most challenging part or what has been the most challenging

296
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
part to work on of default to date that can help give insight.

297
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I like to ask questions that get insight into their process because sometimes, you know,

298
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
they'll do something and we'll react to it and be like, it'll be obvious on our end or

299
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
it'll seem straightforward on our end.

300
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But it's because we don't understand the thinking that went into something.

301
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So I like to ask questions that make me understand what they're thinking.

302
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So sometimes things that seem simple and easy for us to do, like, well, you know, this

303
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
was easy.

304
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Why don't you just do this?

305
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That was really challenging to put together, which could also shed insight into, well,

306
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
going forward, why don't they just do this?

307
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's just a flipping a switch, right?

308
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's like, well, actually, you know, this and that.

309
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You know, I actually, I actually agree with you.

310
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So a lot of a lot of people will actually, not a lot of people, that's not the right way

311
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
to phrase it.

312
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Some people think that when we have the opportunity, and this is like a rare thing, I don't think

313
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I've ever been able to speak to Blizzard freely openly.

314
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And they have just like, you know, throw whatever you got at us.

315
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And you can look at a snapshot of Diablo 4 at any point in time and say, I like this.

316
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't like this.

317
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Will you buff this build?

318
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Won't you buff this build?

319
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
This balance is off.

320
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Da da da da da.

321
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But that doesn't help me project how I think the game will be in the future.

322
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The thing that will help me do that is, what do you guys think over there when you're

323
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
in your chair?

324
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We can see all the reddit threads of what people think you think.

325
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But what I want to know is what do you actually think?

326
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And then all of a sudden we can start to figure some things out that will actually, you know,

327
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
happen in Diablo 4 rather than focusing on a snapshot in time.

328
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's a great way of framing it.

329
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah, I also like to avoid any questions that are just basically thinly built suggestions

330
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
because we have our ways to pass our suggestions under them.

331
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Right, we have platforms.

332
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
We can make a, you know, you make a YouTube video with suggestions, the depth see that

333
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
they hear that.

334
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
An interview is some like it's kind of like wasting time basically passing along a suggestion

335
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
when we know we can get that feedback to them.

336
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah, you know what I actually, I watched your interview multiple times.

337
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I watched a little bit of your follow up conversation as well.

338
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
One of the first things that I was going to ask them, you actually touched this multiple

339
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
times in different areas in your interview, but talking about kind of like the really end

340
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
game, the aspirational content.

341
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I heard them say Lilith was mechanical mastery.

342
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It wasn't based on gear and that it, you know, I agree that most people thought that that

343
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
wasn't fun, but I don't know if it wasn't fun because of the hit boxes of the waves or

344
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
because it was just challenging.

345
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But then later on, they talked about, again, you asked them again about the aspirational

346
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
or the pinnacle content.

347
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
And you said, well, they can make players weaker, they can make monsters hit harder, they

348
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
can have more health.

349
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But in general, for it to feel like an ARPG, the decisions that you make before you go

350
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
into a fight should matter more than in the fight itself because otherwise you're playing

351
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
like a souls like game.

352
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But they did mention that when they do have aspirational or pinnacle content, if they

353
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
properly label it to the community, then the backlash actually really isn't there as

354
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
long as it's properly advertised.

355
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But I would say like, again, my follow up question to that whole idea there is what about

356
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
skill though, because the Uber Lilith was the moment in the game where I feel like I

357
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
actually triumphed over a tremendous challenge, a peak ahead of me in my Diablo 4 journey

358
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
that I finally overcame that I didn't just win because I found a shackle or I got a

359
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
perfect role.

360
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I actually had to learn some mechanics, play well and win.

361
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I wanted to ask them, is there any plans for stuff like that in the future?

362
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It doesn't have to be AOE, one shot, crazy hitbox, things like that.

363
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But it sounded to me like they were kind of moving away from that entirely and that honestly

364
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
makes me sad.

365
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I think that's definitely worth asking, whether they're planning to add any skill-based

366
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
end game or pinnacle content.

367
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
One question that I didn't have a chance to ask was, what is your philosophy towards

368
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
adding new end game activities to kind of get an idea of what kind of new stuff we can

369
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
expect to come or if even say like, no, we're done.

370
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
We think we're in a good place now with it.

371
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And I don't think that's the case, but to try to see where their minds add with regards

372
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
to what more they're going to add.

373
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Would you see the update from last epoch a few days ago about their one-year roadmap?

374
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I wish I had a chance to.

375
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm definitely going to dive into that before the weekend.

376
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I just been slammed.

377
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah.

378
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So it is a spoiler alert if I tell you a little bit about it right now.

379
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Go ahead, please, too.

380
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So in every single quarter, they're making significant improvements to the end game.

381
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Like my title, my title is like last epoch update and my thumbnail was end game, end game,

382
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
end game.

383
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
There's this every quarter, end game, end game, end game, changing this, adding this,

384
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
this new thing, da da da da da.

385
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And again, I'm not trying to ask like, question, like put a gun to their head or whatever,

386
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
but I wanted to, I don't know if it would be rude to draw an analogy to that and be like,

387
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
you just saw last epoch update and it looks like there's a title wave of many end game

388
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
updates coming in their future roadmap and it looks good.

389
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I mean, that's, that makes me happy as a player because like they talked about in your

390
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
interview, there's a huge difference between what's fun to do one time and what's fun to

391
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
do repeated times.

392
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And a lot of people rip through the campaign and do a couple of echoes.

393
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Like, okay, then what?

394
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
But I think these constant updates to end game are going to, are going to do well over

395
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
there.

396
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And I want to ask them, is there ever going to be a roadmap for Diablo IV that looks like

397
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
that end game, end game, end game, end game, every single time end game, end game, end game.

398
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But what, yeah, what are my questions would have been?

399
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Do you guys plan to do a roadmap?

400
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah.

401
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Give it to me straight because let's be honest, you're the, you're the voice of reason,

402
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
you're the sweet little angel, everyone loves you.

403
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And I'm like, you know, like on the shoulders and I'm like the devil with the pitch fork,

404
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
is it, is it very rude if I ask a question like that?

405
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Give it to me straight.

406
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I don't know if I might, might have cut up there for a moment, but I, I actually did

407
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
want to ask if they were going to do a roadmap.

408
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I don't think they will and I think the reason is they don't want to pigeonhole themselves.

409
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
They might even touch about this in the past.

410
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I think I anticipate the answer to be that if they're not going to do a roadmap, it's

411
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
because they don't want to pigeonhole themselves into a specific path.

412
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And then if something else comes up, right, and some other fire they have to put out,

413
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
they got to rearrange the roadmap.

414
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Now they're going to piss people off because they have to push things off.

415
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I think that will be the reason they would not want to do a roadmap, but I still, it

416
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
was a question I did want to ask.

417
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I don't think it necessitates, you know, framing in the context of another game.

418
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,000
If you want to, you could, but odds are they probably haven't seen that video either.

419
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
But I mean, roadmaps in general, I think is totally fair play to ask.

420
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Okay, I'm going to ask it maybe in a, in a quote unquote, softer, softer way.

421
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Okay, what else?

422
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What other pressing topics are we missing?

423
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I mean, I have four pages here.

424
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't think this is ever going to happen, but I forgot if I managed to ask this, but

425
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I want to ask whether the scope and size of seasons we've seen in two and three is about

426
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
what we can expect going forward.

427
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So whether the vision for what seasons are has changed since launch.

428
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Okay.

429
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Without being able to find the question specifically, so I'm going to kind of ramble here the question,

430
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
but basically we've seen in the past couple of seasons, there's the season launch and

431
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
then there's like maybe one or two things that happened during the season.

432
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I see there are like the Abattoir of Zier or like a mid summer or sorry mid whatever mid-winter

433
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
event where there's like a couple points that happened throughout a season that I guess

434
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
is intended to bring people back.

435
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Just I'm wondering like what is their intended cadence of I guess content roll out like

436
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
is it again is what we have seen sort of what we can expect going forward or do they plan

437
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
on having more content beats throughout a season or fewer kind of what they're thinking

438
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
there.

439
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Actually, I want to know what your thought is, what do you want to see in a season?

440
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Do you like everything happens on day one and then nothing changes for the rest of the

441
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
season or do you like to see some other little content drop, you know, two weeks in a month

442
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
in or what would you like as someone who plays these games a lot?

443
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Well, let me tell you something CJ that happens to me a lot.

444
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I don't know if this happens to you, but one thing that I get spammed all the time on

445
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,000
the internet is Rax's opinion doesn't reflect the community's opinion because he plays

446
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
the game all day.

447
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So Rax doesn't speak for us and whatever he says can be taken with a grain of salt and

448
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
is not going to help the community.

449
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I hear this shit and I on every platform every single time.

450
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So what the mid-season events have been are fun little very low time required, very

451
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
low effort, cutie, patuity things to get some cosmetics.

452
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
That's what they have been.

453
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And I think that the majority of the people that play casually, which is I understand

454
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:40,000
is 95% of the people that play the game probably really like that and that event probably

455
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
kind of aligns with what they're looking for.

456
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So does a mid-season event need to change from their perspective?

457
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Maybe not.

458
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
The thing for me about what has not drawn me to them is the events and mostly the rewards

459
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
have not seemed very great.

460
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Like for example, if I got to, if I did the winter event and it let me transmog as a snowman,

461
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
like I'm actually a snowman on my horse, I would have done that because I mean I can be

462
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
a snowman.

463
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
But what they currently have doesn't entice me to log in and complete the event for me

464
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
personally.

465
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And it's not because I just play in them.

466
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
People say, oh, it's because Racks plays in them.

467
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I like events that are timed and have some kind of a little competition to them.

468
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It doesn't even have to take a lot of skill.

469
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It could be, I don't know, who finds the most Rudolph, the Red Nose reindeer things in

470
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the snow for the event and you win a prize.

471
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And maybe there's a cap on how many noses you can find per day so that way the casuals

472
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
don't miss out.

473
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But I love what P.O.E. does.

474
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Like P.O.E. takes their game, gives you a completely different version of the game and

475
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
has a little bit of a race to it.

476
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Bro, I'm never going to win those events ever.

477
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm never going to win prizes.

478
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And I think that that's way more fun than the season events that Diablo 4 is doing.

479
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So that's a complicated answer in that what they're doing right now is probably fine

480
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
for the masses.

481
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But if you want my answer, I haven't been enticed to play them at all for those reasons.

482
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
How do you feel about it?

483
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeah, so I mean, I guess if we're speaking about what things we have gotten, I would say

484
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
for the most part, they're okay.

485
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Like, I don't love the season events.

486
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I don't hate them.

487
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's something to do.

488
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It doesn't take particularly long.

489
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's not exactly thrilling.

490
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
It comes in at a point in the season where we're pretty much already kind of done.

491
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And it's just sort of maybe giving us a couple more hours of play time.

492
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
On top of that, so we've had that and we've also had Avatar of Zer that also released later

493
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
in the season.

494
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
That was in season two.

495
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Season three, we had the gauntlet come in later on.

496
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
In both those cases, that was content also not for me.

497
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So it's not something that I engaged in for very long either.

498
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I do like that there is stuff to come back for, but I think I'm like you and that I would

499
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
like it to be something that I guess I personally would be more invested in.

500
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So what would make you more invested in them?

501
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
That's a great question.

502
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And I think, I don't know how familiar I was with Hell Divers.

503
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And I know anytime I bring this up, people are like, it's an entirely different game.

504
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It's an entirely different show.

505
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Okay.

506
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,000
But to me, it is like the perfect example of live service done perfectly because it's

507
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
a game that cannot exist without it being a live service.

508
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It justifies in every way it being a live service.

509
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
They're content roles.

510
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And so I'm not saying that this is what they should do in RPGs, but just to frame what

511
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
they do in Hell Divers too.

512
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
They have a patch.

513
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They have a patch once a week with generally there's new content that rolls out on a pretty

514
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
regular basis.

515
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And they have stuff in their patch notes, but they also have stuff that's not in the patch

516
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
notes.

517
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And that tends to be like balance changes towards their weapons and stuff.

518
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
That's definitely in the patch notes.

519
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But then new enemies popping up, that's just sort of people discover it while they're

520
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
playing the game.

521
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And they sort of like have little teasers going up to it like a week before like, oh, on

522
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
this planet, I saw a mech and I could get in the mech guys.

523
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm actually driving a mech.

524
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
What the hell?

525
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
They added mechs in the game.

526
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And like two weeks later, they give us this major mission to actually unlock the mechs

527
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
for everyone.

528
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So they sort of tease it in the game.

529
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
First, people are like discovering stuff in the game and say, oh, what's this cool stuff?

530
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And so the game is changing and evolving over time.

531
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And it's not all just like one patch where they say, this is everything that's coming.

532
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And now there's nothing left to get excited about and discover.

533
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So for me, I've been loving Hell Divers.

534
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Like I don't really play games outside of stream.

535
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And I've been playing a ton of Hell Divers with my friends and having a blast.

536
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So I don't know.

537
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I really like the way Hell Divers is doing things.

538
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I wonder if there's any way to integrate that kind of stuff or something of that into an

539
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
ARPG.

540
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So you like the main thing for you is the element of surprise and discovery.

541
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You don't quite know what you're getting into and you have the feeling that when you're

542
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
playing, you might uncover a little diamond in the rough kind of thing.

543
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, that's definitely a part of it.

544
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And I think in the ARPG sense, we don't want to be changing builds because in an ARPG,

545
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
you are investing heavily into creating your build.

546
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So it's not like, oh, this new weapon.

547
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And now I need to like redo all my character or whatever.

548
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But like if it's content that we're doing like a dungeon or an enemy type or a raid or

549
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
you know, whatever, sorry, raids, not the word, you know, what is some kind of boss or

550
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
an Uber, like new things to engage with as opposed to things that are changing our build,

551
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
right?

552
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Like we want to stick with the same build that we're building up because we're investing

553
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
time into it.

554
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
But if we're getting a balance change every week, then it's like, well, why am I even

555
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
bothering to grind up all this gear?

556
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
It's going to get nerfed next week.

557
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But I do think there's places, especially with this big open world of Diablo IV, justify

558
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
the open world, make things happen that attract us to different places to go there, you know,

559
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
check out whatever dungeon that is or whatever pit runner.

560
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I don't know.

561
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah, the, I'm trying to think of analogies in Diablo IV.

562
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I have been surprised a few times.

563
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I didn't know, I remember in the vampire theme, I didn't know how the ambushes that the

564
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
ambushes were going to happen.

565
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I almost died.

566
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Yeah, that was cool.

567
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And I was testing on the PTR and I ran into a goblin pack.

568
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
They didn't put that in the patch notes.

569
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh, yeah.

570
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So that, but those were probably kind of like maybe too small in scope for what you're

571
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
talking about.

572
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You're looking for something a little bit bigger than that.

573
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But I, I mean, as someone who degenerately blast the game, you definitely, you definitely

574
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
notice those things.

575
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Surprise, they didn't put other kinds of goblins in the game.

576
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Maybe that's another thing I could ask them about.

577
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I don't imagine maybe over time that something's a little, little do you know?

578
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You want to know another thing that I really enjoy in games.

579
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
It's in, it's in like all the different games.

580
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's in POE, it's in Elden Ring, it's in Diablo III.

581
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I like it when you're playing the game and there's like a very rare chance or like a secret

582
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
that opens a portal somewhere entirely different.

583
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And it asks you the question, do would you like to go in here instead and see what's in

584
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
here.

585
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And when it's like, you know, it's challenging or it's rewarding, then it can be really

586
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
fun.

587
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Like when the vault spawns or the POE side areas, when I went through the campaign as a

588
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
beginner, you know, you see the side area, you really want to go do it.

589
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It looks fun.

590
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You know, you find out later, all you just skip everything and just run through it.

591
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But the idea of it is there, Elden Ring, you open a chest and it teleports you to an

592
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
end game zone and there's like a big drag in in front of you.

593
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's like, ah, should I really go fight him?

594
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Probably not.

595
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I told him he might drop me like his tooth or something and then I can kill everybody.

596
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I wonder if that would be another kind of thing that you're describing.

597
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Can you give a like imagine we're running nightmare, you're running nightmare dungeons in season

598
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
for it and on your 40th one, it just drops a gold portal and it just says leads to a place

599
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
that does not exist.

600
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It doesn't have to be the cow level but anything.

601
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And you'd be like, holy shit, what is this?

602
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I have never seen this.

603
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Okay, let's go in.

604
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Let's see what we have here.

605
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I think that would be absolutely amazing.

606
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And I guess so question for you and for, you know, Chad as well, because I know some

607
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
people they want everything to be launching at the start of the season.

608
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
But what if that happened like a month in like no announcement from Blizzard, but one month

609
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
in to the new season racks is playing and suddenly a portal opens and no one knows what

610
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
the hell this is.

611
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Everyone is seeing this for the first time on racks of the stream and he goes in and

612
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
it takes him to the cow level, for instance or whatever, something else.

613
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And now all of a sudden people are like, well, there's this new level and people are

614
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
going to start logging people who like they were done with the season.

615
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Now they're going to start logging back in to try to find this, this new secret level.

616
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Oh, data miners.

617
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I don't think a data miners.

618
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Who the thing about data at the interesting thing about data mining is, um, so

619
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
there's a massive push to, you know, find the cow level and we have like, I think we

620
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
progressed as far as we can into the into the quest or whatever.

621
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And but the thing is, is what data mining is, there is no data mine for an area called

622
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
the cow level or anything with a mysterious name or mysterious mobs.

623
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Like they've looked at it very, very thoroughly and it's just not there.

624
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So it's kind of hard to, I don't, I don't know how you hide

625
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
anything from the internet anymore.

626
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
They did this already with sellers.

627
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I would say yes on a very, I wouldn't say on a minor level, sellers are cool, but

628
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
you kind of have to, the thing about sellers is you got to, again,

629
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
when I see a seller nowadays, now that I played the game for a while, I'm not dying.

630
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:48,000
To dive into that seller, I got bigger fish to fry the surprise that could be

631
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
waiting in the seller is usually not worth the time invested to check it.

632
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
It's it. That's why I don't, I don't know.

633
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Do when you see a seller, CJ, if you're doing hell tide, if you're trying to get

634
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
some boss mats, if you're leveling up your nightmare dungeons, do you get on your

635
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
pony and ride over to a seller to go check it out for a surprise that might be in

636
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
there?

637
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Sell large, what, what is this?

638
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
The little, the little random, I'm trolling you.

639
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah, no, I don't, I don't care at all about sellers.

640
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Yeah.

641
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Okay.

642
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You got me on that one.

643
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I was like, what?

644
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah, I think it's a great point.

645
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
We're like, if they are going to add these, these transformative things, they,

646
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
they need to be significant enough that we would care about them, right?

647
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Like if, if, you know, a month into the season, they add like a flower in a

648
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
town, like, it's not something that's big and exciting.

649
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah.

650
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Exactly.

651
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Okay.

652
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Before I let you go, are there any final things?

653
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Because I got one thing I have to do before we start here is I have to

654
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
organize these probably by order of importance.

655
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Because I don't think I will get through like, I don't know, like any of this,

656
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,000
but I'll try.

657
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Is there any other critical question that you would like to get an answer on that

658
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
didn't get to yesterday that we haven't already covered?

659
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I'm going to think of that a moment longer, but I will also say, I ordered my

660
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
questions in order of importance.

661
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And I realized I should have also kept in mind how long each of these

662
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
questions would take to answer.

663
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Because I had to start triaging throughout the interview and skipping some of my

664
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
important ones just because I knew that they would be really big answers.

665
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And so I was jumping down to still important, but very shorter questions.

666
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So something just to bear in mind, I guess, as you're also asking those,

667
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I don't know if I don't think I got to ask about map overlay.

668
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I know some people still care about that.

669
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's probably going to be a shorter answer.

670
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, PVP again, not a super priority thing, but I did kind of want to ask,

671
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
are you guys happy with where PVP is now?

672
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Or do you have any plans to expand on in the future?

673
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Trade, you've opened up trade in season four, any plans to give us some tools

674
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
or something to increase the quality of life of trade.

675
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So we have to go to external websites.

676
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I have a, that's my number three.

677
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I will get to that is social features trading group finder, clans,

678
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and asking about, you know, trying to avoid third party sites.

679
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Beautiful.

680
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yep, I have that.

681
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So I can do like quick hits here.

682
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So the quick hits I have are how do they feel about loot filter?

683
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
How do they feel about PVP?

684
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
How do they feel about SSF?

685
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
How do they feel about offline mode?

686
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
How do they feel about

687
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
ladders?

688
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
We can put...

689
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Here's one question I wanted to ask.

690
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I mean, it's kind of low priority, but I wanted to ask the

691
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
mic you borrow before he left, tweeted that Diablo 5 will come much faster than Diablo 4.

692
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Do you think I would ever get an answer to the question of,

693
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
have you guys already started to work on Diablo 5 or plans about what Diablo 5 would be?

694
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I mean, even if the answer is yes, do you think that will ever...

695
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Do you think we'll all even get a yes or a no answer out of them for that or no?

696
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
They wouldn't say whether they start or work on Diablo 5.

697
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
They might start, they might say they've been thinking about it,

698
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
which I mean, honestly, whether they've started working on it or not,

699
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
like it's an easy answer to say, well, sure, we've thought about Diablo 5.

700
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You might want to ask,

701
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
bring up the Ibarra quote specifically and ask what they think about that or what they think he meant about that.

702
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Might be a way to allow them to say something on the topic.

703
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I'm just going to eat it.

704
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Just get rid of it.

705
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I ain't got no time for any wishy washi questions that aren't going to get an answer.

706
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Another thing that I saw a lot of people,

707
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:04,000
another thing that I saw a lot of people ask about was the campaign.

708
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
So a lot of people liked the campaign, probably like the most polished,

709
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
polished experience that Diablo 4 delivered and the campaign is one and done.

710
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Now, people don't...

711
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
There's some people despise the thought of doing the campaign again,

712
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
especially like the escort quest with the camel or whatever that was pretty brutal.

713
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
But I wonder if Diablo 4 could be a game where you could actually

714
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
choose and it would be a legitimate choice where you could benchmark, okay,

715
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,000
what is leveling up and hell-tight in the overworld look like after you spend three hours doing it?

716
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You are essentially at this level with this kind of gear.

717
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And then you time a campaign run for three hours and you expedite the camel quest or whatever

718
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
make it get rid of a lot of the stuff that no one wants to do a second time,

719
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
but for the most part, to keep the whole campaign intact.

720
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And then after you get done with that, you're at about the same spot and let people choose.

721
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Do you want to do the campaign or do you want to do the overworld?

722
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Because right now, if you do the campaign, you're just a million years behind.

723
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
That's actually a really clever way of doing it because yeah,

724
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I'm my first thought upon hearing like the campaign, just exactly what you said.

725
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I'm like, oh god, like don't make us have to do the campaign again.

726
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
But that's actually a really clever way of working it in where it's still more efficient to just

727
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
slam the health hides. But for those who want to do it, you're not going to be terribly far behind.

728
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
All right, man. Well, I appreciate you as a person.

729
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I appreciate your professionalism in the interview.

730
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I think you cracked the egg and got into actually a lot of really good topics.

731
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I know a lot of people are big fans of yours. You've been doing this for a long time.

732
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
So big respect, man. I'll try to do round two of this and see if we can get

733
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
see if we can get some more questions answered here.

734
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Well, your axe. Appreciate you. I look forward to your interview.

735
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Best of luck. You're going to kill it and I'll be watching.

736
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
All right, man. Guys, round of applause for CJ.

737
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Here we go with round two of the interview for Blizzard. Thanks, man.

738
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Okay. I need, okay. So a lot of these questions up here, I think, are important.

739
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
What I need you, I don't think I have, I only have 16 more minutes, not even 16.

740
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So I have the top questions for you. The important thing here is the order.

741
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm going to ask these questions first. It's just follow up to CJ's interview.

742
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
So I'm going to, I'm going to ask these questions first.

743
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Actually, don't really care about this. I'm not going to have time. Let me just delete it.

744
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,000
The top questions for YouTube, I'm asking the social features is way too important.

745
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I must ask it. Here's the,

746
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:30,000
this is supposed to be here. Social features is going to get asked 100%.

747
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I already asked this question. I can delete it.

748
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
This is really not that important. Just delete it.

749
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Maybe I can put it down here. Let me organize this for a second. Give me a moment.

750
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Um, okay. Let me look at this.

751
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:02,000
This is probably lower priority. I'm going to put this lower. I don't really care about

752
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,000
how Microsoft, I don't need this question anymore. Let's put this here and delete this.

753
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I really want to, I really want to talk about this. I really want to talk about the target audience

754
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
of Diablo 4. If they were willing to talk to me about it,

755
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm going to move this lower. Maybe here.

756
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Let's go like, um, let's go like that. Okay.

757
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Okay.

758
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I didn't go here.

759
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
It's actually a way I want to know when Ubertoon Lord is coming out.

760
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Did I put the campaign somewhere else?

761
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Um,

762
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
got another question that we need to ask. Yeah, map overlay. Another question that we need to ask.

763
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Is

764
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
something about balance.

765
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
This is kind of like a generic question.

766
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,000
We can keep it, but maybe I put it much lower. Let's cut this out.

767
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,000
This I think is a very, this is a very good question.

768
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I really want, I really want to ask about this.

769
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Okay.

770
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Um,

771
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set a timer for 40 minutes.

772
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And then when I get to 40 minutes, I'm going to go to the quick hits and I'm going to ask all of them.

773
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Just real quick,

774
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
knee jerk reaction to what do they think about these things.

775
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
So let's set it for 40 minutes.

776
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And then I'm going to ask all of them.

777
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
What time is the interview in 11 minutes?

778
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Okay.

779
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Okay, I think this is important.

780
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I already asked all of these. So I'm

781
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
consolidating my list significantly.

782
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Social features. I need this to go here.

783
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
This needs to be tabbed over.

784
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
All right.

785
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Okay.

786
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Okay.

787
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Okay. So let's look at the order here that I have and let's see if this is

788
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
pretty good or not.

789
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
So the first thing I want to talk them about is pinnacle content.

790
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I'm going to ask this first.

791
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
They talked about it a lot in CJ's interview.

792
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I want to ask them, is there ever going to be skill involved in the endgame?

793
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Or is it all going to be about gear?

794
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Along with that, let's ask for a roadmap and is there main focus the endgame?

795
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
That's the thing I care about probably the most.

796
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I think I can delete this question.

797
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
This is so, I don't do that.

798
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
They always say that they deeply care about feedback.

799
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And one super mysterious thing about Blizzard is how do you actually receive the feedback?

800
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Do you guys have meetings about it?

801
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Can you walk me through like to someone is Adam?

802
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
God, how many atoms are there?

803
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
There's Adam Jackson.

804
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
There's Adam Fletcher.

805
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
How many atoms and Joe's are there?

806
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Is there a team that gathers it all and then you look at it and then you have a meeting about it?

807
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:19,000
I want to know how do they process feedback and how do they test things?

808
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I want to hear from them how they do it.

809
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
The state of nightmare dungeons, they made them better.

810
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
You can teleport to them.

811
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
You buffed Glyphdxp.

812
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
They're putting more things to do in them like events.

813
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
You lower the cast time to 0.75 seconds.

814
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
They said in CJ's interview that they want to iterate on nightmare dungeons.

815
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I want to ask them, have they considered more qualitative ideas,

816
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
not only with the current state of nightmare dungeons, but in the future?

817
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
For example, can we carry multiple objects?

818
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,000
If you have two rocks and two pedestals, if you go rock, rock, you're already guaranteed to backtrack.

819
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Stuff like that.

820
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Is there any reason why we can't reduce the cast time further?

821
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
You miss 100% shots you don't take.

822
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
It's not necessarily that I mind freeing prisoners.

823
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It's I mind freeing seven prisoners.

824
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Why is there seven of them?

825
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
How about like three where I just click them and they're free?

826
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
And then the slay all with one monster behind.

827
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I know that there was a fix for little things to follow you,

828
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
but that doesn't work all the time.

829
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And it bricked some of our nightmare dungeons.

830
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Don't get into drama questions.

831
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Right, I do.

832
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I don't think any of this has any drama to it.

833
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Wait, there's no drama here.

834
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Okay, I'm done.

835
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So they're setting up and their discord is broken.

836
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Their discord is broken, so we're going to do it in Zoom.

837
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So they're going to send me a Zoom link.

838
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
That there's something wrong with discord.

839
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So we're going to Zoom.

840
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Okay.

841
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,000
They're they're not trying to back out.

842
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
No, they're not trying to back out.

843
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Yeah.

844
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Yeah, M3X did Seattle.

845
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Um, all right.

846
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Okay.

847
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yeah.

848
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Let's see how Zoom is going to go.

849
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,000
All right.

850
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Let me, I guess we're going to join now.

851
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Let me, uh, let me switch my screen real quick and see if I can join the Zoom link.

852
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Be right back.

853
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Alrighty.

854
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Click on this.

855
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Open the Zoom meeting.

856
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Here we go.

857
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Join.

858
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
That should work.

859
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Let's try that.

860
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Okay, I'm in.

861
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
But let me see.

862
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I think I have to start virtual camera on OBS.

863
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Let me start the.

864
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
There we go.

865
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Does that work?

866
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
There.

867
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Well, kind of.

868
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I'm not going to move this down.

869
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Maybe.

870
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
There.

871
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
That actually kind of worked.

872
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Okay.

873
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
All right.

874
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It was a mic issue that was disabled Adam Jackson's mic.

875
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I'm flexible, man.

876
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I am flexible.

877
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
We do whatever.

878
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Whatever works.

879
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I'm big chilling over here.

880
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Big chilling over here.

881
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
All right.

882
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Um,

883
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
yeah.

884
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I'm sitting here.

885
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Let's see if Adam and Joe can come in here.

886
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,000
All right.

887
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Well, while we're waiting here.

888
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I guess there's, I guess there's no issue in me.

889
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Coming back here, right?

890
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Okay.

891
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Okay.

892
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Let me see here.

893
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Let me get rid of this webcam.

894
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Maybe.

895
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Let me get rid of this.

896
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,000
All right.

897
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
What's up?

898
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
All right.

899
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
And I wonder if I can show.

900
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Hey, what's going on, man?

901
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,000
What is up?

902
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
What is up?

903
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
All right.

904
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Can you?

905
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It's happening.

906
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Can you guys hear him fine?

907
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Is he fine?

908
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Up or down?

909
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
How?

910
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
How is it sounding guys?

911
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Can you talk for a second, Joe?

912
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Do you just testing the ups and downs?

913
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Now what's what's up?

914
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
How do I sound, chat?

915
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yeah, I can see it's way too low.

916
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I'm going to turn you way higher.

917
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Let's try again.

918
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I can just start.

919
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I can just start screaming.

920
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Hey, how do I sound right now?

921
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Okay.

922
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Is that better, guys?

923
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Up more, up more.

924
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Okay.

925
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We're going.

926
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I have you at 100.

927
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Okay.

928
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
This is dangerous.

929
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I'm going to.

930
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
This is going to get dangerous when I get excited about something.

931
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
So we're going to watch up it up.

932
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:05,000
All joys me.

933
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Hey, thanks so much for coming on here, man.

934
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I'm really excited.

935
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Yeah, this is going to be a blast.

936
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I'm looking forward to the conversation.

937
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Hell yeah.

938
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Where's my partner in crime?

939
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Where's Adam?

940
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Is he Jackson?

941
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
You want to know what he's faking all of these technical issues?

942
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And he's just like, you want to know what?

943
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I'm going to call him sick and I'm just going to have Joe solo this.

944
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Yeah, it's fine.

945
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Let's do it.

946
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Just sign him up for a whole bunch of stuff.

947
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Okay, so what I'm going to do here,

948
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
try my best to be as prepared as possible.

949
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Cool.

950
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
But of course, I'm probably not prepared at all.

951
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So that's just the way life goes.

952
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
No, no, no, no, it's all good.

953
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Hey, and one thing up front right up top here is like,

954
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I have a lot of things I want to say, but it's okay if you want to interject.

955
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
So if it's not rude, I'm not going to take this being rude.

956
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,000
So if there's the things you want chat for or things you want clarification on,

957
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
like please, please, please interrupt me.

958
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,000
It's all good.

959
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I feel like I feel like I want to give that preface to everybody I talk to now on stream, right?

960
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I would never interrupt that sweet and jellic mella fluis voice speaking of that.

961
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I'm going to ask for questions.

962
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And people hear me, okay, I've spent the last 45 minutes troubleshooting my mic and

963
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
expend the worst.

964
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It's okay.

965
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Dude, is that a paper towel roller by your bed?

966
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
How do I get one of those?

967
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I have kids.

968
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
They're very messy.

969
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It's part of the life.

970
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Dude, that is that's the most ingenious thing I've ever seen.

971
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
We're pretty creative over here.

972
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
You can hear me, okay, though.

973
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I'm very concerned about this.

974
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Expond.

975
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Okay, thank God.

976
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I mean, chat, can you hear them?

977
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Sounds perfect for me.

978
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
How is it for you guys?

979
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
All right, cool.

980
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Because I changed, I fucked up all my computer settings and now everything's terrible.

981
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
But as long as it works, I'm happy.

982
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,000
All right.

983
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,000
All right.

984
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Okay, I'm starting a 40 minute timer.

985
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Then we'll do rapid fire at the end to try to hit as many as possible.

986
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
That sounds good.

987
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Sounds good to me.

988
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Thank you so much for being here, guys.

989
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
All right, yesterday, C.J. Riker did an interview with them.

990
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So he asked a bunch of great questions.

991
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I want to do some follow-ups to some of the questions that you guys talked about.

992
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
So one thing, the topic that I think you guys probably covered the most in the interview,

993
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
you asked for a different parts was about aspirational and pinnacle content.

994
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Some of the things that you said that was Uber Lilith at the start of the

995
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Diablo IV was all mechanical mastery.

996
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
If you don't dodge the waves, you're dead.

997
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
There's pretty much nothing you can do about that.

998
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
And a lot of players didn't have fun just, you know,

999
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
getting crushed by her waves.

1000
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Talked about there's different lovers to pull on the difficulty.

1001
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
You can make players weaker like Nightmare Dungeons sigils.

1002
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
You can make monsters hit harder.

1003
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
You can give them more health, more crowd control.

1004
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And I heard you say that the decisions that you make before you go into the encounter

1005
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
should matter more because it's an ARPG.

1006
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
It's about hunting loot.

1007
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
It's about getting powerful.

1008
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And then you go in and you have a big advantage.

1009
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And you finally overcome the difficulty.

1010
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And another thing that I heard you guys say is when you guys introduce very difficult

1011
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,000
events like the Avatar of Zier, for example, when you properly advertise it as something

1012
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
that's very difficult, you didn't get any negative backlash or too much negative backlash

1013
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
for the difficulty of it because it was properly labeled.

1014
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So with that huge preface in mind, my question is,

1015
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
do you guys have plans in the future of Diablo 4 to build in these very,

1016
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:45,000
very difficult encounters that do require skill, that do require you to go in with an event

1017
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,000
or with a boss, learn their mechanics, and that is going to be another supplement

1018
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
besides getting gear to winning.

1019
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Thoughts on that?

1020
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Yeah, sure.

1021
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So I can just kind of, I'll start off.

1022
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So yeah, everything we talked about yesterday, you just did a good job of covering again.

1023
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I appreciate that. But when we think about what the future of aspirational content

1024
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
needs to look like at the game, we do want to leave opportunities for this kind of a

1025
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,000
mechanically complex content players to engage with and we experiment with it a few different ways.

1026
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So I don't think that the L-Eco-Low-O-Think counter, it's a really good example of us

1027
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
like diving really hard into mechanical mastery works for players to really have to be very,

1028
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
very active in terms of their dodges, nor survive.

1029
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
But we do want to continue to experiment with these ideas and try more things,

1030
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
particularly when they are advertised in the appropriate place.

1031
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Adam, do you have thoughts on this?

1032
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Yeah, originally I did and it was like a very long-winded answer,

1033
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
but I don't want to take up too much time on this. I guess what I'll say is,

1034
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
you know, everything kind of exists on a spectrum when we're talking about things like

1035
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
difficulty or a lot of game design topics and ideas.

1036
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Like in this spectrum in my mind, it's like, you know, how hard should the theme be versus how

1037
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
how much should your gear going into it matter, right?

1038
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I think we're still trying to find out what the best answer is for the things that are really,

1039
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
really hard like Uber Lilith or these crazy difficult fights.

1040
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
One of the things that we're doing in season four that we started doing in beyond that one of

1041
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
our encounter designers came up with a great idea was adding this, I think you probably

1042
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
seen our A-Rex, but that's a second debuff idea where you can screw up getting hit by a wave

1043
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
a couple times, but then after that you're probably just going to get one shot and die.

1044
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And so that gives us this kind of happy medium between pure one shot mechanics and things where

1045
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:41,000
you have to be perfect in your dexterity versus the other way where you can just like out gear

1046
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
everything. There's some other things that you can go into of like, you know, the difference of

1047
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
the most powerful, at least powerful mid-powerful builds and how we do difficulty, maybe we'll

1048
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
get that a different answer, but that's the TLDR. I think we're still trying to figure out what is

1049
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
best for our game and what our players like. You know, in my heart of hearts, I'm more like U-Rex,

1050
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I love the very, very crazy hard things. I don't mind one shots personally in my games, but I

1051
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:11,000
don't think it's best for this game. It's not millennium. We have to play it. Yeah, I don't think

1052
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,000
that it's best long-term, but having a little bit of that kind of stuff sometimes I think is okay.

1053
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I think it's more how much and how we introduce it and how we frame it to people. That's the

1054
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
simple answer. Okay, so kind of like one thing that you guys are liking is kind of like the soft

1055
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
and rages where over time eventually it gets so difficult that you're eventually going to lose.

1056
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Yeah, 14 does a good job with this as well. Like they have this idea, like, you know, if you

1057
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
miss up a mechanic, you get a guest deck and deep off, it can escalate and get worse and worse

1058
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
as the fight goes on. It's an interesting way to allow for some mistakes or current for some

1059
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
learning to happen, but really like and to punish you, but not immediately spike you in any encounter.

1060
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Awesome. So one thing that some other games doing is they release road maps of kind of like in

1061
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
the same topic of end game of things that Cali, stop it, sit down. Sorry about that.

1062
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,000
So for Diablo IV, will we ever see road maps come out kind of showing like detailing what might

1063
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:15,000
be coming in the next six months to a year? I know that there is some challenges with that.

1064
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Like if you guys change your mind, then like the community gets really mad at you. What are your

1065
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,000
thoughts on that? I think it's important that can be knows that we are identifying problems, you know,

1066
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,000
and that we we are listening, as I've said before. And I think that a road map does a good job of

1067
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
expressing some of this information, but it does to your point does lock us into a schedule. So I think

1068
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
that we're kind of like thinking about how we want to approach like explaining these sorts of things.

1069
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
You'll recall back in like season two, I mentioned at the very end of actually between when we were

1070
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
wrapping up season two and AOC was out and we were getting ready to begin talking about season three,

1071
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I mentioned that we had identified a lot of itemization issues and things we wanted to make

1072
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:58,000
upgrades to and I'm going to have updates which turned into the season before and season four.

1073
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Now I want to make it clear that we identified a lot of the issues that players have been talking

1074
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
to us about for a while, but we weren't able to like immediately resolve those sorts of things.

1075
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,000
So I don't want one thing I occasionally see from players when they see a long road map is they'll

1076
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
see something that they care deeply about it like really really towards the end of a year and they'll

1077
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,000
ask them like well, do they not think this is important? Do they not care about this? And I think

1078
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
that there's a way for us to talk about these things that players feel they they they have confidence

1079
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,000
like that we are looking at these problems and we do have plans. So I think we're just working

1080
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:37,000
through exactly the way that we want to approach this. Yeah, I think I'll try me in a little bit.

1081
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,000
One of the things that you're going to hear is a constant theme from me and other designers say

1082
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,000
this with different words, but there's this idea that there's there's rarely really perfect solutions.

1083
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
There's really only tradeoffs in the world and this is actually comes from an economic term.

1084
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
This says that there's never solutions only tradeoffs, but you know when you ask us things like,

1085
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
you know, why don't you do X or Y or why don't you provide road maps the way that our brains

1086
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
immediately go as well? There's pros and cons and which decision is best trying to get the most

1087
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
pros that we can with the least cons that we can, right? It's simple example of road maps is the

1088
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
pro of road map is everybody's on the same page. We showed out, hey, we care about these things and

1089
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
the community knows what to expect, right? Obviously that is a desirable thing to do, but there's big

1090
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,000
cons that maybe we have that you don't see and this is where most design discussions end up of people

1091
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:29,000
asking, that's what do you think it's developers? Is that we try to explain the cons to you so you

1092
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,000
understand the full picture? You know, the cons of a road map is we're locked in now. We promise

1093
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,000
things to you that we may not be able to do for whatever reason when things end up changing down

1094
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:45,000
the road, right? Life has a way of screwing with your plan, especially when you try to plan things

1095
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:51,000
more long-term. This isn't just a game design, but anything. So we try to keep promises and keep

1096
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,000
promises like one of my things I'm really passionate about as a designer is when it comes to

1097
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
interacting with the community, making promises and then keeping them. So I'm extremely careful

1098
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
of the promises that I mean this is just my strategy of how to build trust with people and the

1099
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
community and just life in general is I'm very careful of what promises I make and then I make

1100
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,000
damn sure when I do that I keep them. And so to do that the longer our road map goes out the higher

1101
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
chance we're not going to keep those promises. Some things, for example, that we've ceded in the past,

1102
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,000
um I remember it was either our season one or season two campfire chat. I made a list of things

1103
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
that our team wants to do longer term. One of those things on those lists was making scaling

1104
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
mechanics for legendaries that kind of suck. And we finally we're doing that in season four, right?

1105
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
You know your earthquake legendaries all of those we finally made them scale with your weapons

1106
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
and make the damage go up. I also talked about at the time and we haven't delivered on this yet

1107
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
in my opinion, but making ultimate meaningful and scale in a similar way. It's on our radar,

1108
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
something I want to do, haven't done it yet. I didn't give a date because I don't know when the

1109
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:54,000
day is because our timelines and schedules and priorities change quite a bit based on community

1110
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
feedback. You know, if I made the promise like, hey, we're definitely fixing ultimates,

1111
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
then we're born when it happened because I have to spend my team's time on doing that other thing,

1112
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
but this other thing came up that I think is way more important for the game. And that's just kind

1113
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:13,000
of how the nature of our job goes. Thank you for the super detailed answer and that is a perfect

1114
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:21,000
segue into my next question is kind of like an edition of Mythbusters kind of. So a lot of people

1115
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
in the community, a lot of the people that are angry in the community about, you know, whatever it

1116
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
is they're angry about at the time, they say that they're passionate about something.

1117
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Passionate. Very passionate. That's the, that's the word we're looking for.

1118
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Structively passionate, yeah. Constructively passionate. So one thing that I, they have like the

1119
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:43,000
mean video of you guys saying feedback, feedback, feedback. And then on the internet from a bunch

1120
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,000
of different angles they say, Blizzard doesn't listen to feedback. They don't do anything. They don't

1121
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:55,000
even test their game where they're beta testers. So I wanted to ask you guys, could you give us some

1122
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:02,000
insights into how your team actually processes and internalizes feedback? Is it like concatenated

1123
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:09,000
for you and you guys have a meeting and you discuss it like that? How do you guys go about testing

1124
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:15,000
things internally to kind of debunk all of these myths that you guys are just working by yourselves

1125
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
and never listening to anything? Do we know it's not true? You want to go first Joe or?

1126
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Yeah, I think we both probably have different things you want to say about this. So I think that

1127
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
the point on feedback, I think you're that that's being brought up, there's like kind of two

1128
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,000
things like one are the designers in a corner entirely by themselves, like just making decisions

1129
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
with no information being good at them. And the other version is like, is the team listening to

1130
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
the community, right? And then how do we process these sorts of things, right? So the

1131
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
starting from the does the team listen to the community like side of this thing? You know, we are

1132
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,000
always reading everything on that it's getting posted on right, we're getting everything it's posted

1133
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
on the forums, we're going through our socials on a regular basis, we have teams and people like Adam

1134
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Fletcher, you know, the community director, he's going through and like kind of gathering a lot of

1135
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:11,000
this information for us and and in places where we don't like I personally can't read every thread

1136
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
in every social media site, right? I can't, but I can't because I there's other things I also do as

1137
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
part of my job, but I do read a lot of stuff, right? And a lot of things get sent to me. So a lot of

1138
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,000
that stuff can get like kind of pulled together for like reporting purposes and brought to us, right?

1139
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And I think that's really, really useful. We also have a lot of internal feedback that we get

1140
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
from the from the team, like so when we start working on something, we we were able to like kind of

1141
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
give a presentation to Dio for all that team to get an idea of what we're trying to do. We have

1142
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
regular play tests, we're like a large people all get a chance to kind of give us feedback on a

1143
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
regular basis and we can keep checking in with them as time goes on. So that's I think that's a

1144
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
a starting point for these things, but it's it's really important to us that we are like hearing

1145
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
things from the community because that's kind of telling us like are the like are the changes that

1146
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
we're making right now? Are they effective? Like are people having a good time with these things?

1147
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Because we can look at all kinds of data determined things, but like here when people talk about it's

1148
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
also really, really important when they have when players have needs that aren't met, you know,

1149
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
it's our job to find ways to kind of like bridge the gap there, make sure that they're they're

1150
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
they're being heard and the game is going to be more fun for them, but what do you want to talk about?

1151
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Yeah, so firstly, I would say different game companies, different teams and even different teams

1152
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:24,000
within a bigger team have different cultures and ideas in ways that they process feedback. So

1153
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I'll tell you what I do on my team and kind of what D4 kind of does is a larger team, right?

1154
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So on the live team, we are probably the most interactive with feedback because we're doing

1155
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
the live changes. We have to be very connected to the game to make the decisions. So I give this

1156
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:47,000
speech a lot to the people on in my group of your job as a designer is to go and find the problems

1157
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
with the game and then you are the filter when the community comes in and brings up things,

1158
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
whether it's a streamer giving things, I post things all the time from streamers, I post things

1159
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
all the time from Reddit threads, I post things all the time from our forums, anywhere that you can go

1160
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
out and go and also personal play experience, nothing replaces that as well. So we actually

1161
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
dedicate every day at least some amount of time that everybody in my group is either playing an

1162
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
internal build of future things coming out in the game, which I'm playing through season 5 right

1163
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
now and I'm really far in it, or they're playing their live character in the live game because

1164
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
you need to understand the game and understand the problems. And the way that I do things,

1165
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
what I've been trying to tell my team and I think we're pretty good at, is while you are

1166
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:31,000
parsing all this feedback, you are and playing the game yourself, keep a running list of notes

1167
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,000
of crap that sucks that you want to make better or ideas that other people had that you think are

1168
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
good ideas that you want to make better. Now of course not every idea is equal right you don't copy

1169
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
every Reddit thread and every single thing that someone says, we are the filter of trying to figure

1170
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
out, remember I talked about those trade no perfect solutions only trade offs, this is where we're

1171
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
like hey they brought up an idea and we think it's good now we need to explore if I can actually

1172
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
work in the game and this is where we come up with our list of things and priorities that we're

1173
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:01,000
going to do, that's a starting point. The other, that's one of a few starting points, the first

1174
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
starting point is you know community feedback, our own play experience. Another one is telemetry

1175
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
and that's just a fancy word for data. We have the ability to see data all over the game of how

1176
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
many people are equipping different legendary aspects, how many of people are engaged with certain

1177
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
types of content, we can see what's working, what's not working, what people are actually doing

1178
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,000
versus what they say, usually what they say will match with what people are doing but there's

1179
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
a mismatch that we have to have a discussion of like hey how important is this actually?

1180
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
And then another way is internal testing tools, again we have a group that give us presentations

1181
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,000
and people who their job is to look through data and do focus sessions and all kinds of other

1182
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:45,000
fancy tricks to come up with stories and understanding the different types of players we have

1183
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
of what they're doing and how they work and they give us presentations on different topics that

1184
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
we're interested in or they find their own topics of things that maybe we didn't think of that we

1185
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:58,000
may have missed. And then last but not least we have internal people you know we have a big team

1186
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:05,000
of people working on this game and we have certain feedback avenues via emails or channels that we

1187
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
give feedback to each other because on new stuff we can't rely on telemetry or the community

1188
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
or all those other things and that's where things are a lot harder. I think Joe went into this yesterday

1189
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
a little more deeper so I'll just go also over it but this idea that Diablo is a freaking huge game

1190
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
that takes forever to play and really truly understands our systems are so interconnected

1191
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
so there is no substitute for actually going through that 80 plus hour experience and playing

1192
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
everything. The part that makes that really hard and where I think the community gives us a hard

1193
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
time sometimes I think a little bit of his warranty but it's just a cursed problem is what I call

1194
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
it which is another concept I'll go into later is that to really test our game you need to

1195
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,000
spend your life playing our game in many ways or a lot of time more times more hours than what

1196
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
you normally would expect someone to work at a job right so we can't tell people hey you must

1197
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
spend all your life playing this game but also by the way you have to design and create the new

1198
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,000
things too right so that means that internally it is really hard to play test the full amount of

1199
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
our game as a designer we have to rely on we have people in QA and other playtesters that do play

1200
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
this content we either direct them of things we want to test and play or they just find things on

1201
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
their own that they think hey they bring it up to us okay we think this is a problem and we have

1202
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
to purse that but there isn't enough time for a single design or every designer to play the game

1203
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
fully all the time but we do still play it a good amount and we use those internal feedback mechanisms

1204
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
to make things the best that they can and this is where I think there is that little disconnect

1205
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
sometimes with the community where yeah we would love to polish things and play it now I would

1206
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
love to play season five two hundred hours before it comes out I only get it for you know 50 hours

1207
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,000
right and we have to use our guts and existing ideas and telemetry to figure out if the decision

1208
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,000
would make a right and then we use after we launch the game to really fine tune and make it perfect

1209
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:51,000
right and that's kind of the overall process of how things work yeah one last thing I want to add

1210
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
here too is that even we're just thinking about like a feature like we're talking like adding one

1211
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
thing like to be like the pit for example good example because it's it's to come in new coming out

1212
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
in season four if you sit down you play the pit for an hour one day you're going to feel a certain

1213
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
way about your experience playing the pit you're going to feel differently if you play that for

1214
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
two hours a day five days straight you know and you and you experience it through that entire process

1215
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
you're going to have a different relationship with the content at that point and players are going to

1216
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
go you know 10 20x that number by time they're done playing in season potentially so like what's

1217
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
really really important that we get the reps in on these features make sure they're they're really

1218
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
resonating and they're singing they're doing everything they need to do right so I think if there's

1219
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
there's a lot truth everything that happens talking about everything is a lot trade-offs there's a lot

1220
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
of things we need to do and this this kind of links to the PTR the PTR feedback for season four was

1221
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,000
hugely valuable because now suddenly we're able to like take take what we already know about the

1222
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,000
season and then multiply that like 10 20 50 fold as we get tons of players going in checking things

1223
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
out not just from the telemetry but also just the feedback we're getting from content creators from

1224
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,000
players themselves like we've got a lot of really good data for that so it's been it's been very useful

1225
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:58,000
for the same reason to add and talk about yeah I mean I go go ahead sorry no go ahead one last real

1226
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,000
quick thing is this is where you get things that seem obvious to players that were bad ideas but

1227
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
sounded of really like really good ideas worst in the room talking about it that simple example

1228
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:14,000
given season four is when you temper your items or things and there's like a really nice thing

1229
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:20,000
that plays and you can see it it's visual yeah skip it easily right that kind of stuff is where

1230
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
sometimes things fall through the cracks of hey doing this 2,000 times is actually terrible because

1231
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
you've got to wait forever versus well we want to have a moment of celebration and for the cool

1232
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:36,000
thing to be cool balancing these things is what can be harder to do internally we're obviously we've

1233
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
messed up enough times and this is true for every game company so I'm not afraid to admit it but like

1234
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
you know we've made that mistake enough times that we now we're very cognizant of it like we make a

1235
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
new feature or a new activity like hey how does this feel if you're doing it for 200 hours is this

1236
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
still going to be something that people want to go through right that's a question now that we ask

1237
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:56,000
all the time but even then there are times where we have to kill otherwise good ideas or we have

1238
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
the fluts a little bit because we do need some presentation or some tutorialization or some other

1239
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:07,000
thing to balance that even if it makes the you know 2,000 times experience a little bit worse right

1240
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
the answer's not always so obvious I guess but we we are receptive to like when the community tells

1241
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,000
us clearly hey no we want it to be this way we're gonna do it that way I mean it was a lot of

1242
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,000
great points I mean the the I'm very glad that I asked that question because the thing that

1243
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:30,000
is refreshing to me the thing that I I wanted to hear more than anything is that you guys have a

1244
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:36,000
chance to actually play through the game and not only to hear that you guys play the game as almost

1245
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:42,000
part of the job description but it sounds like you actually put a big effort into that that I

1246
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,000
mean that makes me feel that makes me feel great honestly that's that's so great to hear I'm so

1247
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:55,000
glad that's part of the process um talking about some of the current uh modes in the game let's talk

1248
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
about you talked about yesterday the state of nightmare dungeon CJ did a ton of iteration on it now

1249
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,000
we can teleport to them you just buffed glyph XP you said that you'd like to add more fun things to

1250
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:12,000
do to them in the future you guys made events better now I saw goblin packs I think on the ptr when

1251
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
you put the vampire ambushes that was good you reduced the cast time down to point seven five

1252
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:23,000
seconds so we're gonna have new things coming out for it um my question is is going forward it looks

1253
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:30,000
like you guys made a ton of qualitative changes to it like you just make it a little bit easier to

1254
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
access all of these different things rather than riding around on your pony to every single thing

1255
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and everything takes forever when you are designing future things is that kind of at the front of

1256
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:46,000
your mind with things like oh maybe at nightmare dungeons we can carry multiple objects because if

1257
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
there's two rocks and two pedestals if you go rock rock you're guaranteed to backtrack I mean I

1258
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,000
have two hands and then have you thought about reducing the cast time even further I know that one

1259
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:03,000
comment was if the cast time is so low then people may not even see that they interacted with something

1260
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
but maybe that could be updated via like a like a little quest thing oh quest pick up two rocks oh

1261
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:16,000
it highlights oh now pick up one rock and another part of it was it's not it's not just that I have a

1262
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
problem-freeing prisoners I have a problem going to dead man's dredge and the quest objective is

1263
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I have to free seven prisoners like how many people got caught here is qualitative stuff still at

1264
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,000
the front of your mind when you're iterating on these things and in the future events that you're

1265
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:39,000
going to make so I think that there's a couple different pieces to pick apart here right so I

1266
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
with nightmare dungeons they're building upon the the dungeons we had in Diablo 4 right and these

1267
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
were supposed to be these really like kind of interesting little content things you can find all

1268
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
over the world they all had little bit like little bits of like environmental storytelling objective

1269
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
big storytelling some side quest point to these dungeons as well and we want players to feel like

1270
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
they're kind of they're going on a little bit of adventure when they go into these we didn't we

1271
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
didn't initially make the content in these spaces to feel like there's like blast corridors if

1272
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:12,000
that makes sense right so I think that as we as we think about what different players are looking for

1273
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:18,000
and what what we can do to improve the experience for everybody we don't want to lose the kind of like

1274
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,000
um the contextual unlike fantasy underpinnings of what players are doing they go into these spaces

1275
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
to your point like you know it's not that you hate freeing prisoners no but you don't like that it

1276
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
might take you know point seven five seconds to do it is there's one question maybe and then

1277
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
there's another one where it's like we don't want a free seven so you kind of want to be like a faster

1278
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
more punchy experience but it's not that you don't like having to click those objects as part of

1279
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:45,000
your experience going through a dungeon I think that like there's uh I think there's an expectation

1280
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:50,000
when players are like doing some of these actions there's a response so having just a quiet like

1281
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,000
a quest tick for some things I'm not saying that this is a we would only ever make this decision

1282
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:00,000
and a quest tick for things like freeing a prisoner it is it is feedback is it as impactful as having

1283
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
the moment where you get to see your character unbinded on the binds I'm not so sure you know but

1284
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
in the end is that value it's to Adam's point earlier about like you know it's about making trade-offs

1285
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
is the is the idea for the player who does care does care about like kind of going slowly

1286
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
to space and trying to find the collectibles and trying to do all these things for that player is

1287
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
it is it going to be a big miss for them if they click on stuff and just kind of like it has a quick

1288
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
update doesn't feel like anything has really changed so it's where like where we want to optimize

1289
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:30,000
things I think when you look at content like the like the pit you know um and it's a lot of things

1290
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
we didn't help out as well no we've made a lot of attempts trying to make sure that the content

1291
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
feels like there is less friction you know it's going through so like when you get into a flow state

1292
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:43,000
that you're happy with uh you can kind of maintain that that that pace so and we made a number of

1293
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,000
changes you already called out tonight we're done it to also kind of support this so I think it's

1294
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,000
a question like how much further do we want to go within nightmare dungeon specifically right

1295
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
because I think we've already said that we're looking at this for other other pieces of content

1296
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
um I don't know where we're going to fall necessarily for the uh for the the channel time for

1297
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
clicking on objects and freeing them it could be that it comes out a little bit lower

1298
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
it could be that we decide we want to make changes to make it more more instantaneous we haven't

1299
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
really made a decision you know we'll continue to be looking at feedback as we play and also from

1300
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
like different players like players which are just playing the uh the apple for the first time

1301
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
want to kind of hear what their experience is like as well

1302
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:25,000
awesome uh so here's kind of like a here's kind of like maybe a huge question but it asks very

1303
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:31,000
directly um so what is kind of the future of the overworld in Diablo 4 when we first released it

1304
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
was kind of the main thing you used it to do everything and kind of the first experience was

1305
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:43,000
that 50 to 100 grind now one to 100 is much easier and the focus is probably you know having

1306
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
enjoying that journey going to the pit and anything in the future that you're going to release

1307
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:52,000
a lot of the things that seem to come out though the abattoir and the challenge riff thing

1308
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:58,000
and the pit they're all instant things are there big plans for the overworld is that still like

1309
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:07,000
the defining characteristic of Diablo 4 are we moving away from that so we you know Diablo 4 and

1310
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
the fact that we have this like big contiguous sanctuary is still a really big part of Diablo 4

1311
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,000
now uh i think that we want to continue to expand the the lamass the areas where players can

1312
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
explore that's still an important part of things but in terms of how players are engaging with

1313
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,000
the experience overall we do expect that um one of the one of the downsides of the uh of the

1314
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,000
the open world uh is that it is a it's a fixed layout right so if we think about like the

1315
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:36,000
sorts of things the players like to play in a in a in a like a replayable content fashion right

1316
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
it's not normally in place where you like really want to keep running through exactly the same

1317
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,000
galaid and the fractured piece are exactly the same area you know of kristin it's it's usually

1318
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,000
you're trying to like find like different things to kind of engage with and like our dungeon systems

1319
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
are places where you can really do a lot more of that i think we push it really well within

1320
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,000
health tides you know there's lots of things happening in health tides uh they're pretty

1321
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
procedural in terms of how things are spawned in and like what sorts of events you might find as

1322
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
you're kind of wandering around uh but in terms of like having a lot more like flexibility to

1323
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,000
create different experiences we have that really more in other systems but i think for this is

1324
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
like uh going back to some things i talked about the other day there's sort of like the experience

1325
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:19,000
the player has with diablo is a is a big game right and uh and i don't say that to suggest that any

1326
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,000
any any ones needs are less important just that there are a lot of different needs different players

1327
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
have different expectations so when some players come into diablo like they're here because they want

1328
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
to go through like this epic story you want to play their they really want to play a sorceress

1329
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
and they want to like see what happens a little if they want to go explore all they want to find all

1330
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
the things and all the zones uh and they want to get really really powerful and then they're going to

1331
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
they're going to take a break until the expansion comes out that's just the way that they sort of play

1332
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,000
these games it's how they that's how they play right for those players these moments is the explore

1333
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
the world it's really really important because that's their experience with diablo it's like their

1334
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
exploration of the overworld i'm going and finding all these side quests talking all these characters

1335
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,000
and that's their relationship with the game for players who play seasonally you know they it's

1336
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
once you've kind of like uh uncovered all the applications that you found all these things

1337
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
and done this stuff you don't there's not usually a lot of reasons why you want to go and have

1338
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,000
that same moment of discovery again you can't really recreate it we talked for a while about like

1339
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,000
moving little statues for pound season to season so you have to collect them again it's it's

1340
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,000
another another one of my brilliant ideas so uh we didn't we didn't do it of course right but like

1341
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
we had the idea of like every season we'd move where the uh the little statues to be found so

1342
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:26,000
players have to go find them again but then the next conversations immediately like well okay so

1343
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
people are going to go on to max or whatever and they're going to go immediately see where the

1344
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
node map is for the next set of alter-lilits they're going then that's now their new homework they

1345
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
have to do at the beginning of every season they have to run around on their horse and go play

1346
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
every single one of these and it's like is that fun now if clearly not for that for that player

1347
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,000
it but it wasn't it was necessarily horrible the first time players do this like that's like that's

1348
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
like that's part of the fun of like almost like an open world game in any way it's kind of like

1349
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
exploration and finding things so i know that i'm i'm getting to go long but so i think that the

1350
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
the the underpinning point here is that the the overworld diablo 4 so really really important

1351
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
as we think about how to make the best use of it for uh like replayable content you know how

1352
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
tides a good example of this blood harvest is really really uh really really helpful for kind of

1353
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
giving us some like ideas of what players are really excited about things that we could do better

1354
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
like the like kind of light social gameplay of some of the creatures and things um and i think we

1355
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
have other ideas we can team to explore in that direction i think legion events and boss events

1356
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
of things we can team to like kind of iterate on and think more about you know but uh i think that

1357
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,000
in terms of creating like like really compelling replayable content i think it's going to end up

1358
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:32,000
in more of the space where you have like more procedural control over how like the dungeon is

1359
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
formulated or like what players can expect to encounter as opposed to these these more fixed outdoor

1360
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:44,000
locations does that answer your question? Yeah so i guess laughing at me i didn't answer the question

1361
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:50,000
no no these are such in-depth answers i'm i'm just scared i'm looking over at my questions i'm

1362
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,000
i'm never gonna i'm trying to figure out how to skip around for all and so i guess so i'm so sorry

1363
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:01,000
no no no this so the the main takeaway that i'm getting there is the overworld is an

1364
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:07,000
a super important part of it like a first players experience discovering everything but then it's

1365
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:12,000
hard to recreate that magic for the people that comes season to season to season and that's why

1366
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,000
it goes more to instance the stuff is kind of i guess the summary of the story of that's the

1367
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,000
reason yeah i think we're also just on a regular basis looking for new ways to engage with the uh

1368
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
with the open world in ways they're gonna be fun for seasonal players as well like so we're

1369
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
we're continuing to find like just experimenting with things see what makes it like fun and new for

1370
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:36,000
players okay i promised i would ask this so there uh maybe there might be a player out there that

1371
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:41,000
you guys have heard of and have maybe added i don't know it hundreds of hours of over time to the

1372
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:52,000
team rob and rob yeah you familiar so he had a rob love rob he is a good guy he's a good guy he

1373
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
had uh two questions about the pit these will probably a little bit more straightforward but um

1374
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:05,000
i guess for for endgame activities is do you guys ever think about or worry about i guess

1375
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:12,000
fishing so like it gets to a point in the pit where oh you're fishing for the right mob type or

1376
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,000
you're fishing for the right boss or and then you just leave kind of like what happened in Diablo 3

1377
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:23,000
or oh i'm gonna go get aha very on and hopefully that it procs the the amazing shrine for me so

1378
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:30,000
then i can finally win and do you guys off the top of your head know about how much the health

1379
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:36,000
and the pit was buffed by and i i'm guessing that the main idea for there is not only to add difficulty

1380
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:42,000
but to actually because the the when you were going through the pit the bills are so strong that you

1381
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,000
delete the the rift part of it in two minutes like clockwork every time and the monsters don't even

1382
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:53,000
get to do anything so i assume like the part of the reason for buffing it is to actually even let

1383
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:59,000
them get a hit on you and see what they even do yeah uh i can take the first part of the question

1384
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:05,000
at least i'm actually able to do what's the other part um so talk about fishing um yes uh

1385
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
fishing for stuff keeps me up at night and i hate the problem and it's a really hard problem to

1386
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:15,000
solve um remember that no salute you know rarely perfect solutions only trade off staying right so

1387
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:21,000
this very much applies to this type of problem right a core thing that we want our game is and when

1388
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,000
it comes to combat and effects and legendary powers unique powers and whatever is we want to push

1389
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,000
y'all bull make cool shit right so i wanted to respect your need to make cool stuff right and that

1390
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,000
involves doing things that aren't necessarily completely deterministic because i think completely

1391
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,000
deterministic things after a while get kind of boring right when you know that you're going to

1392
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:44,000
get this the fact or accept all the time or you do this and get this like we do it a lot by the way

1393
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
so i'm not saying that's not a good design but just you need to have some spiciness some really

1394
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:55,000
cool crazy things right and that that unique uh uber unique power is one of those um on the flip

1395
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:02,000
side though it means that when you make really hard content uh doing things like wanting to make

1396
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
cool stuff uh fishing gets in the way of that a lot of time especially in randomly generated

1397
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
content which is what you know the pit is in many ways so that is why we have to do things that we

1398
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
that by the way we as designers don't like like removing the fun shrines or the things that are

1399
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,000
going to break because then you just find the shrines that you know break the game in whatever way

1400
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
and that's all that you're doing and that becomes the game yeah um this is a core thing about ARPG

1401
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:28,000
that i in my opinion after working on it now for years and i've been involved in pretty much

1402
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:34,000
every game genre extensively as a player and many as a designer um i think ARPGs are one of the

1403
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
hardest if not the hardest genre to design for uh MMOs are really high up there too um there's a lot

1404
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:44,000
of other genres i think are very difficult but ARPGs are a special slice of of awfulness when it

1405
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:50,000
comes to trying to make things fun and also make them interesting um and this is one of the reasons

1406
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:56,000
why so as far as like this exact design of the spear uh we're keeping it in for now um i would be

1407
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,000
very sad if we had to redesign it because it's the only way to get through high pit tiers that would

1408
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:05,000
make me personally sad but because that is the most difficult thing to do uh we may have to make a

1409
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,000
tweak to it but we're not doing it yet we're gonna see how it plays out um but i think that the

1410
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:15,000
conversations more interesting of conceptually like you know is this a problem yes absolutely

1411
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
does it mean that we can't do things that would otherwise be cool and awesome for your average player

1412
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
yes absolutely but we also think it's best for the game because i think fishing for the right

1413
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:30,000
pile set the right mob like restarting a thing over and over to be able to progress is not fun

1414
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
and therefore we have to design the rest of our game knowing that that is a thing um yeah i was

1415
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:39,000
adding that to like i think that you know we definitely see fishing as a problem so much so that we

1416
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000
built the gauntlet you know for the trials feature we're fishing specifically as the thing we're

1417
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,000
trying to account for or we said all right if we if we have a competitive content feature players

1418
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:52,000
going to engage with and it's randomized then players aren't really competing until they find

1419
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
exactly the right seed that they manage to roll to compete against because that's the actual

1420
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
optimal seed that they need to compete to compete on it's only against this monster family or only

1421
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
with this dungeon tile out or only with this like these set of shrines whatever it is so instead what

1422
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
we did is we made a highly deterministic content type that changed it or weak and players went

1423
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
to say like well why is it so fixed like this is boring like i want i want something like i want

1424
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:18,000
to do that's different changes every time but then you kind of fall back to that same point that

1425
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
brought up about like curse like these trade-offs for all the problems that we have then we have

1426
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
we have to decide like all right so we okay with the idea that like players are going to go into

1427
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
a like a gauntlet run and they're going to have a wildy disparate experience potentially between

1428
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
our person a and person b and they are just continually running the other content over and over again

1429
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
in the hopes they eventually get a good seed and that might be the way that they're able to place

1430
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,000
because the difference could potentially be vast between one thing in the next so it's uh you

1431
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,000
know it's copkate space something we definitely think about the other part of your question was uh

1432
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:51,000
what do we do about the uh what do we do about uh like how scaling in the fit the HP uh how much

1433
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:57,000
did it go by yeah so we did make some big changes there uh so basically what was happening in

1434
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:03,000
the ptr is that uh monster scaling monster health scaling was pretty mild uh in the pit going

1435
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
to the first hundred levels it was basically virtually nil you know from level 100 on

1436
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:13,000
more or less right so we ended up putting it in a place where uh like the tier 200 pit is

1437
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:19,000
like okay so like uh like around tier 150 pit is like close to where a oz was you know for like

1438
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,000
tier 25 uh uh uh uh uh a oz runs and tier 200 goes beyond that so it's pretty it's pretty

1439
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,000
considerable the scaling has been increased we still want to be gradual as you're kind of progressing

1440
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,000
through uh because we want you to feel that you have a place to push it's not like so like

1441
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,000
because a oz was 25 tears extremely extremely chunky when you went from tier to tier as you got

1442
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,000
deeper and deeper inside here it's a little more gradual as you go further and further and further

1443
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,000
and we think that's going to be good experience overall um because it's ultimately a lot of the

1444
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
material to really want from the pit you can gain by the time you're like doing like tier 60s you

1445
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
start to get like little bits of the desire that you need to kind of start finishing off your masterwork

1446
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
items and then that gets more and more efficient as you go deeper and deeper you know but there's uh

1447
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:03,000
what we do want to have these like really really difficult challenges we made it we made a a decision

1448
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
at the launch period of the game where we took nightmare dungeons uh difficulty and we kind of

1449
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
scaled it in a different way you know whereas like initially they were extremely challenging going

1450
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
up to tier 100 and we ended up making a reduction in their difficulty uh going into season one uh

1451
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
where we basically rebalanced things such that like the tier 75 old nightmare dungeon was the new

1452
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,000
tier 100 nightmare dungeon and players no longer had that like that measuring stick that really

1453
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
really difficult content anymore because we can't take it away if we want that to still be there

1454
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:37,000
in the pit I mean I think if tier 200 is far beyond abattoirs year 25 especially with some of like

1455
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,000
the balancing and the bug fixes to a lot of different builds I actually I don't know maybe I'm

1456
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,000
wrong but I expect that to be pretty challenging I don't think people are gonna do that as a cake walk

1457
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:53,000
um okay so we have eight minutes left I'm I already cut off my timer there's no way I can get to

1458
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:59,000
99% of these questions so uh how do we feel about maybe doing a little rapid fire

1459
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:06,000
just that okay sure yeah this was talked about yesterday if I remember correct this was the

1460
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:11,000
so these are the top top questions from youtube so I promised I would ask them so here we go

1461
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:16,000
um this was the number one question by far and it was touched on a little bit yesterday

1462
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:22,000
is there an armory coming I heard yesterday I think if I remember what you correctly you said

1463
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:28,000
that armory is great the team the team likes it had to prioritize some things will an armory be

1464
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:35,000
coming to Diablo 4 so we can save our builds uh if you can answer it yeah I mean this is a problem

1465
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
that I think that uh the players have I think I've already mentioned that we're like we're in the

1466
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
business of trying to like solve uh player problems uh it's a thing we're really excited about

1467
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
it's the thing we it's the thing we would like to do and that's all I can say right now

1468
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:56,000
they're excited about it guys okay uh there's lots of different ways to expand the game and as uh

1469
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Joe put it yesterday different slices of of the pizza to give you power again from youtube it seems

1470
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,000
like the most requested way that people would like to expand power or change their builds is to have

1471
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:15,000
this skill tree expanded is that something that we can look forward to at some point coming to Diablo 4

1472
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:21,000
is the team passionate about expanding the skill tree in multiple ways maybe you'll even give us

1473
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:28,000
an ultimate button so we can get another skill you never know uh yeah I'll I'll take this one

1474
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I guess and let's say some more uh I would say I we have nothing to announce about the

1475
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,000
guppies to the skill tree it is a little bit more of a complicated problem because we want the

1476
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:42,000
skill tree to remain as an easy gateway for new players and returning players to come back and

1477
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,000
kind of know what that is and we didn't want the complexity and have to of our game to be there

1478
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
so it comes with some nasty trade-offs that I'm not sure that we're willing to make but we are

1479
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,000
open to the idea of adding some more depth to the skill tree but we don't want it to be super

1480
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:02,000
complicated it's not going to be the P o e in cyclopedia we don't we don't want that at least

1481
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,000
not for our game we want to be crafting in other places yeah if I could show like the like seeing

1482
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,000
how different players like again there's a lot of people like this is their first Diablo game

1483
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:16,000
like seeing what players did with the skill tree in testing yeah I think they're very surprising to

1484
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:21,000
you in your audience they take they take all the generators and max from the 5 absolutely yeah and

1485
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:26,000
other things like that um it's it's a tougher problem that I think a lot of people give it credit for

1486
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
and I don't know that the juices work the squeeze if we go too far but

1487
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
hearing that people want more we've heard that loud and clear but nothing to announce in the near

1488
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:41,000
in the immediate future okay the next one for repeated and summoning content now and in the future

1489
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:46,000
of the game are there plans to let people just resummon these bosses without resetting the instance

1490
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:51,000
because that eats up a lot of time for the people that do want to farm up a bunch of things and

1491
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:58,000
kill some bosses yeah this is a really this is a really good idea um there's a lot of things

1492
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,000
they get cleaned up oh when a plate when players were set a dungeon that makes it a lot easier for

1493
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:07,000
us to do this in the first place uh let me take that back to team I don't I don't know that we've

1494
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:11,000
talked deeply about like exactly when we could deliver something like this but we definitely see it

1495
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
as a we definitely see it as a something that you can improve so yeah we'll we'll take that back

1496
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:25,000
all right um last one from youtube here will the campaign receive further attention so

1497
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:31,000
will well first of all obviously probably the story continues with the expansion but

1498
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:38,000
another way is currently when you start up a new season of Diablo you can you can go through the

1499
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:43,000
campaign again if you want or you can probably now go farm in Helltide and the Helltide is going to

1500
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:49,000
level you a million times faster for a million million more rewards it's not close at all

1501
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:56,000
and some games let you force you to the campaign some games in the before you don't have to

1502
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:02,000
if you guys thought about maybe editing the campaign slightly for a replay maybe taking out like the

1503
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:08,000
camel escort for for example and maybe benchmarking oh how long does it take to do a campaign just

1504
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,000
normally playing what is it three hours for us I don't know what it would be and then benchmarking

1505
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:18,000
what it would be to do it in Helltide and kind of have them at the same point at the end of those

1506
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:25,000
journeys um to allow players a real choice in how they want to start out their new season because

1507
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:31,000
the campaign was such a fan favorite on the launch and it was very well done sure so I think if

1508
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:35,000
there is a like the quest team has a lot of really cool ideas of things you want to do to allow

1509
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,000
for players to like replay the campaign or to make it uh to kind of edit it a little bit in some ways

1510
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:46,000
you suggest I think that uh it's a thing that we're thinking about as we go uh but the we know that

1511
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:53,000
we want to make sure that we are prioritizing the piece of the game that need work first if that

1512
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
makes sense like I think that the idea of being able to replay a campaign is it's very very exciting

1513
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:02,000
uh and I think if there's really neat things we can do and we do have plans in the future for

1514
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
uh for this stuff as well I don't want to like make it sound like we're not committing to anything

1515
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
and we kind of do we want to do something like this it's just that there's a lot of other

1516
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
we're like replay features like health hide for example that we thought are we're going to

1517
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
get a great position to like lift up and make feel like more exciting for players so that's been a

1518
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
more of a priority for us but I do think that there's opportunities there for sure

1519
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:23,000
something there I want to point out this would help when the communities discussing things or

1520
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
when you even are with us is this idea of opportunity cost I don't know if you know what

1521
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
are you familiar with that term racks yeah economic yeah get up something to gain something else

1522
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
cool then then I don't have to explain it but yeah the opportunity cost comes very heavy into play

1523
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:41,000
when we talk about features and suggestions and things from players I think a lot of times it

1524
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,000
can be frustrating as a member of a community because I'm a member of gaming communities too so I

1525
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
know how it is I'm like hey you know this thing we obviously it sounds like a good idea and we all

1526
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,000
agree it's a good idea why don't the devs do it right away and most of the time when that is true

1527
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,000
it's because of opportunity costs it's that the excited opportunity cost or something that you

1528
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
didn't realize makes it harder than it seems um but opportunity cost you here it's like do we do

1529
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,000
boot re-border do we redo how all the boot works in the game and your entire leveling experience

1530
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,000
with our updates to the helltide or do we make a campaign have parity with not doing campaign to

1531
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:16,000
level up right now campaign campaign have parity the non-campaign obviously is a good thing but I

1532
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,000
would argue very heavily that loop being better in a loop based game is more important and impacts

1533
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
more people in a better way more in a more long term way and then there the list goes long

1534
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
long forever forever of the things that you could do versus what you have to decide to do and then

1535
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:35,000
the other part um kind of alluded to your last question about uh re-summony bosses is that I would

1536
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,000
say in that one like yeah obviously good idea better player experience in there I would say the

1537
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:44,000
reason why we're not doing it just knowing how the game works a little bit more is it's our game

1538
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,000
wasn't structured that way and we have to do a lot of things to make it structured that way and the

1539
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:53,000
ants did actually do it is harder than most people would think and that is why um both of these things

1540
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
are obviously good ideas that we would want there's different reasons why we haven't done them yet

1541
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
doesn't mean they won't happen but it means that it's why they're not happening now or yet um

1542
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
and that's a better way to frame it when people are talking to each other because like hey what should

1543
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:12,000
the devil to fourteen do first or now or hey you know maybe this is a little bit harder could you

1544
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
explain why x harder would be a good question for an interviewer for example right because then

1545
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:20,000
you're going to get actual insight into why rather than just complaining that it's not happening

1546
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,000
are you providing uh rags feedback on this i mean i might be giving feedback on the

1547
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:30,000
feedback that's part of my job too but i mean i like productive conversations is why and i think the

1548
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,000
community would rather have more productive conversations then their only avenues to complain

1549
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
and not know why things aren't working the way that they want to i think people want to know how

1550
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:41,000
things work i think they want to know how things work i want to educate people so that we can

1551
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:46,000
have better conversations about games i mean i i'm gonna lose or guys i'm always here if you guys

1552
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:56,000
ever want to talk which we're we're we're actually at time um i have one more all right i mean

1553
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:02,000
probably probably the the one that i i'm just going to ask a fifteen-part question then to

1554
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:10,000
to abuse the one more i guess i love it gamer at heart probably probably the the most important one

1555
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:18,000
that's still left on the list is about social features so there i have three main topics of so

1556
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
i just i can't believe how many questions i put here that was so stupid and me i mean there's

1557
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:30,000
no no chance at all anyway um social features so the there's three main things trading group finder

1558
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:37,000
clans so with trading um what are your guys thoughts on putting an auction house

1559
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:43,000
esk type of thing just to allow trading and to avoid third-party sites obviously not a real money

1560
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:52,000
auction house um people are begging for a group finder um i don't know why people have kudis

1561
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:59,000
i play by myself but i guess people want it and then clans i understand uh i understand there's

1562
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:04,000
a big difficulty with clans not just implementing them like they were implemented in diablo three

1563
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:10,000
but diablo three clans mean absolutely nothing it's just a second friends list there's no

1564
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:15,000
achievements to do there's nothing to unlock there's nothing to work toward but then if you put

1565
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,000
that in the game opportunity cost the thing that the economic principle we keep talking about

1566
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:25,000
then if you build that in the game then people have to belong to a clan

1567
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:32,000
and otherwise they feel left out which then leads me to another one of my million questions about sss

1568
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,000
but whatever so for social features trading group finder clans what are your guys' thoughts on

1569
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:44,000
those three for diablo four let's get going so uh for trading okay uh trading in season four

1570
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,000
players can trade legendary unique uh there's so i can have to like uh go and actually meet up

1571
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:52,000
to do those trades there's not gonna be an i'm a trading function there are things we talk about

1572
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,000
with the guards like the trade chat channels make it a little bit easier to navigate um in terms

1573
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:01,000
of like creating like an actual auction house user interface it's a thing a team is discussed uh

1574
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:06,000
it's not that we've land on we really want to see what the reaction is for players uh in season four

1575
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:11,000
and what the experience is broadly for players in season four how many players are actually trading

1576
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
you know because i imagine there's gonna be it'll be different for different types of players right

1577
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
um but i think there could potentially be room for an investment there because we don't want to

1578
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:22,000
just push players just to like third party sites but we were at a point where we're like well do we

1579
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:27,000
really want to like go and make a whole if it would be an opportunity cost would be a big investment

1580
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:32,000
to go make an auction house uh for diablo four for example um without knowing exactly what the

1581
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,000
desire for it is going to be and we didn't want to like wait to like let some of these things be

1582
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
tradable in the meantime uh so that's the hell version we're not opposed to what we want to see

1583
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:44,000
have things going season four uh for the with the guards to the uh like uh group finder i think

1584
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,000
is the way that you call it um we do want to make sure that there are easier since

1585
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,000
for players to use to find parties of players who are doing things that interest them uh we do have

1586
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
a social team on diablo four they've been thinking about clan stuff things like this things that

1587
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
make socialization more easy between players uh i think they'll be saying stuff to share in the

1588
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
future so there's things we're thinking about and there are uh and then with regards to uh

1589
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:11,000
last one clans of course clans uh we also have ideas of things we want to do to update parts of

1590
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,000
the clan functionality to make it just a little more engaging to give more purpose to parts of clans

1591
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:19,000
you know this is a thing that we are we have designs for and things we're thinking about i can't

1592
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
announce anything today just to say that we recognize there's some parts the social features in

1593
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
diablo four that can be leveled up made better and there's process we see players going through

1594
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,000
as part of regular play and seasons we want to make easier and more streamlined for them

1595
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:38,000

1618
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,000
pretty disheartened man i had so many more questions

1619
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,000
oh i had so many more questions man

1620
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
i

1621
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
feel like i feel like i spent too much time talking

1622
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:27,000
like i spent too much time maybe phrasing the question maybe

1623
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
then i could have gotten a couple more in

1624
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:41,000
and i purposely didn't i purposely didn't like i wanted to have a conversation with them

1625
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:47,000
about every topic but if i have a conversation with them about every topic i only get to ask two

1626
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
question

1627
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,000
man dude i wouldn't ask them so many more questions

1628
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I super over prepared for that, I guess.

1629
02:08:47,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Well, did you enjoy the conversation?

1630
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I'll tell you the most shocking thing to me.

1631
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I literally said it in the interview.

1632
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:10,000
They block out time for the developers to play the game because they said the only way

1633
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,000
you're ever going to know anything is by playing the game.

1634
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I thought that was pretty good, man.

1635
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:41,000
What's the cliff note version?

1636
02:09:41,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Okay, so, should I close it one second?

1637
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:09,000
The TLDR version.

1638
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:24,000
The TLDR of pinnacle content and will skill ever play a factor is, I think the way I would summarize their answer is, yes, they're will, but they're still trying to find out what the right level is.

1639
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,000
The roadmap, they said, has a lot of pros and cons.

1640
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:36,000
The pros have to outweigh the cons, but they feel committed to giving the community promises that they keep.

1641
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:51,000
When I asked them, how do you actually, how do you, by the way, there's so many people subbing and doing super chats and somebody gifted 50 subs, Mr.

1642
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:59,000
G point gifted 50 subs.

1643
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Thank you.

1644
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
So many people are subbing and stuff.

1645
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I actually, I don't know how this happened, but it actually got, actually closed the notifications somehow.

1646
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,000
That was an accident when you reopened this.

1647
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Thank you guys.

1648
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Sorry, I was just a thousand percent focused on trying to suck blood from a mummy trying to get everything I could out of that.

1649
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:31,000
There's a million people that subbed with prime and 56 month resub from maximum.

1650
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
That's crazy.

1651
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
So there's so many of them.

1652
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Thank you guys.

1653
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Make sure I didn't miss anything crazy.

1654
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Thank you guys.

1655
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Sucking blood from a mummy.

1656
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Never heard of that.

1657
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Like a mosquito sucking blood from a mummy.

1658
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Extracting water from a stone.

1659
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Same analogy.

1660
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
You sure sucked them hard, racks.

1661
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Thanks, man.

1662
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I sure sucked them.

1663
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
All right.

1664
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I thought, I thought I almost threw this question out.

1665
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I actually thought this was the best question I asked them.

1666
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Because they did say we read the Reddit threads.

1667
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
We watched the streams.

1668
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
We watched the YouTube videos.

1669
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
We read the comment sections.

1670
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,000
We go to the forums and they said we play the game.

1671
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:28,000
That's the only way you will ever really know to play the damn game.

1672
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:37,000
I thought that was the best part.

1673
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
On Nightmare Dungeons, I essentially just cried and asked them.

1674
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Stop making me free seven prisoners and reduce the time further

1675
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
and let me carry multiple objects.

1676
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:51,000
And I think the answer was maybe.

1677
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Overworld's future.

1678
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
This is maybe the answer that kind of surprised me a little bit.

1679
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I was kind of, I mean, what they said made perfect sense.

1680
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:09,000
They said the overworld is super fun kind of the first time through afterward.

1681
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,000
You can't really recreate the magic.

1682
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
We need to just get you to the events that you want to do.

1683
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Like, I can't argue with that logic.

1684
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
That makes sense.

1685
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:31,000
But I did kind of expect them to, I guess I expected Diablo 4 to double down on the overworld's future kind of more than what I heard.

1686
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I was actually kind of, this is probably the most surprising answer to me that.

1687
02:13:39,000 --> 02:14:02,000
The overworld in general is not not totally a one and done, but that's, that's what I got out of their answer.

1688
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
You think you want it, but you don't.

1689
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Well, I just got done playing 130 hours of Elden Ring.

1690
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,000
And all I did was roam around in the overworld.

1691
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:19,000
And all I ever think about in my life is when am I going to play Elden Ring again?

1692
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:24,000
And when am I going to do new game plus and 30 more playthroughs of it?

1693
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I understand it's a different kind of game.

1694
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
This is an air PG. You don't have to tell me.

1695
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I played it trillion different games.

1696
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:39,000
But my point is World of Warcraft, one of my fun is, one of my favorite things, World of Warcraft, get on the pony and ride around and go see what we can discover.

1697
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:44,000
And there's, you know, there's so many things to go do.

1698
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I wouldn't say that overworld is, I think I want it, but I don't.

1699
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:54,000
In fact, I think one of the most fun game modes in the game is in the overworld, Helltide.

1700
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I think Helltide is more fun than Nightmare Dungeons.

1701
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:07,000
It might be more fun than the Pit, but probably not. The Pit is probably more fun currently, but it's way more fun than World Bosses and it's way more fun than Challenge Riffs.

1702
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:13,000
So, I don't know.

1703
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:21,000
I don't, I don't think, I don't think they should abandon the overworld.

1704
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:30,000
That is not how I feel about it.

1705
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:39,000
These were Rob's questions.

1706
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:46,000
They actually said this in CJ's interview.

1707
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:53,000
They said this that the Diablo 3 had some cool things that they could borrow from and some things that they didn't like.

1708
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:58,000
So they actually kind of pseudo admitted that it is kind of like Diablo 3.

1709
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:03,000
But I wanted to ask them, where do they, do they often take inspiration from the past games?

1710
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:15,000
And they said yesterday on CJ's stream that there will be new things that are, and this is a quote, distinctly Diablo 4 fresh and exciting.

1711
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:18,000
I wanted to ask them about this.

1712
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I wanted to ask them, are you actually innovating on ARPGs?

1713
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Distinctly Diablo 4 fresh and exciting.

1714
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Do you actually, are you actually planning to release new things that really the ARPG world has not seen?

1715
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Because that would be exciting.

1716
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I wanted to talk to them about set items.

1717
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,000
They talked about it yesterday on CJ's stream.

1718
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I had more questions, man.

1719
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
I wanted to talk to them about rune words.

1720
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
They said that they like rune words.

1721
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
They were working on it and they're going to come into Diablo 4.

1722
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
But I still have questions.

1723
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I wanted to talk about charms.

1724
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
I asked all the questions from YouTube.

1725
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I forgot to write their, I forgot to say their names.

1726
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I should have said their name.

1727
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I forgot.

1728
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I should have said their names.

1729
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:30,000
The interview is over, yeah.

1730
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Seeing names adds time.

1731
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
And then I was out of time.

1732
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:41,000
And then I said, well, probably the next best thing I could ask is about social features.

1733
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:47,000
It didn't sound like they have anything coming for trading anytime soon.

1734
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
It sounded like they actually, I was surprised.

1735
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:53,000
They actually sounded like they had something for Clans coming.

1736
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:59,000
And they didn't sound like they had anything for trading.

1737
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:10,000
What did they say about GroupFinder?

1738
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
What did I think about the interview?

1739
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Well, I liked the Callie literally just walked up to me and farted.

1740
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Thanks for that, Callie.

1741
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Thank you.

1742
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Did you see Callie trying to crawl on me the whole interview?

1743
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
No, it's not even a drive-by.

1744
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
She runs up far, so then she sits there and wags her tails.

1745
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
She doesn't go anywhere.

1746
02:18:39,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Nothing to announce, but it's being discussed.

1747
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:07,000
What is my overall opinion about their answers in the interview?

1748
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:17,000
It's hard to judge because it's hard to judge like being in the moment.

1749
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I probably have to go back and rewatch it to get the full to absorb the full amount of information.

1750
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:29,000
But it felt like they were being very honest.

1751
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I don't know.

1752
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I thought that they were giving good answers to the questions that I asked.

1753
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Adam Jackson said at the end was exactly how I feel where he said,

1754
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:49,000
it's not really that valuable for you to ask me like a yes or no question.

1755
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:56,000
And I give you the answer and you post it somewhere and no one ever knows the why behind anything.

1756
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:06,000
So what would be much more helpful is having in-depth conversations about opportunity costs.

1757
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I'm glad that I studied economics in college because they were actually talking about a lot of economic principles.

1758
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Is like do you know what an opportunity cost is?

1759
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Yes.

1760
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
I love economics.

1761
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I love math.

1762
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
So that helped.

1763
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:39,000
One time the one time college actually pays off.

1764
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:43,000
They were talking about their problems, their problems.

1765
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:53,000
But that's exactly their problems by transitivity become our problems.

1766
02:20:53,000 --> 02:21:01,000
If Blizzard has a problem, it's going to become our problem.

1767
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:09,000
If Blizzard has a problem implementing something, it will become our problem as players.

1768
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:21,000
If someone has a super chat here, never call yourself a loser Ryan, you are awesome.

1769
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Thanks for saying that man.

1770
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
I'm a loser.

1771
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I just sit around and play games all day, but I appreciate the sentiment.

1772
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
What did I major in in college?

1773
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Math.

1774
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I almost got a triple major.

1775
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I almost triple majored in math, stats, and economics.

1776
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I also went pretty far into psychology as well.

1777
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:50,000
I like school.

1778
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:55,000
I always, my corporate job for 10 years always gave tuition reimbursement.

1779
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,000
So I always went to school.

1780
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:05,000
So I got my bachelor's in math and then I had, I put a huge emphasis on stats, economics, and psychology.

1781
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I got my first master's in PNC insurance, the CBCU, and then I actually went for a second master's.

1782
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I'm about a third of the way done with it with an MBA.

1783
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I just like school.

1784
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
A lot of people hate school.

1785
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I loved it.

1786
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I like to go and learn.

1787
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Not from MIT, from the University of Nebraska.

1788
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,000
You got a triple major math computer science and drugs.

1789
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Well, one of them will make you way more money than the other.

1790
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Just watch Breaking Bad.

1791
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I'm a corn husker.

1792
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Yeah, we have the, we used to have the best football team ever in the history of football.

1793
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:46,000
And now we have the worst team ever in work garbage.

1794
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
We don't, we don't, we don't talk about the current day.

1795
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Don't, didn't we get the number one pick though?

1796
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
We got the, got like the top court.

1797
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:04,000
We have like, now we have like the godliest quarterback ever and we have the rest of our team sucks.

1798
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:10,000
You graduated with your cyber security degree this December, hell yeah.

1799
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I didn't go to high school.

1800
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
I went to school.

1801
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
High.

1802
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Yeah, we have real.

1803
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:20,000
So we have, we have Nebraska has racks.

1804
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:30,000
That's a Y equals MX plus B.

1805
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Good old algebra.

1806
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Yeah, did you hear what they said?

1807
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:44,000
You should hear how most players built, you should see the data on how most players built a skill tree.

1808
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Like what's the dumbest thing that they could do?

1809
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,000
What do they do?

1810
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Put five points in every generator and Joe was like, yes, I was like, Jesus Christ guys.

1811
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Maxroll.gg. What is wrong with you guys?

1812
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:11,000
So yeah, if you guys like college football, the Nebraska corn huskers are going to be super interesting to watch next year.

1813
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Because we have the greatest quarterback ever and our, the rest of our team is absolute YMCA rejects.

1814
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:23,000
So how far can one god quarterback take a team of losers?

1815
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
It's going to be like space jam.

1816
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:30,000
It's going to be like space jam, but for football.

1817
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I'm sorry to say racks, but ever since you stop making barb guides, you stop following Maxroll.

1818
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,000
If I don't write the guide, you don't want to read it.

1819
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:57,000
I can tell you the people that write the barb guides over there like snail and is it sloth master and snail?

1820
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:01,000
They put a lot of effort into those guides, man.

1821
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:04,000
They put a lot of effort into those guides.

1822
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:14,000
You can snail is a many, many, many time rank one Diablo 3 player on almost every single class.

1823
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
He's one of the greatest players ever.

1824
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:20,000
You can read a guide from snail and feel good about it, man.

1825
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,000
He's one of the greatest Diablo players of all time.

1826
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:34,000
It doesn't have to be me.

1827
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Who writes the sorcerer builds?

1828
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,000
You ever heard of a guy named North War?

1829
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
North War.

1830
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Everybody follows North Wars builds.

1831
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Nobody does more math in Diablo 4 than North War.

1832
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Nobody.

1833
02:25:53,000 --> 02:26:01,000
He is the best sorcerer guide writer in the world by a huge margin.

1834
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,000
It's not even close at all.

1835
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
There I am.

1836
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
There's no way.

1837
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:11,000
It's not even close.

1838
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Rob's the math guy too.

1839
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Rob's the math guy.

1840
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
You guys remember Rob was on Maxroll for three years.

1841
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Rob's the math guy too.

1842
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Rob's the math guy.

1843
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
What changes are coming?

1844
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
I didn't catch the stream.

1845
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:41,000
It wasn't really an interview about, it wasn't really an interview about changes really.

1846
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:47,000
It's not like a spoiler thing where they can like, announce a bunch of new things on the stream.

1847
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:51,000
It's kind of understanding how are they going to make the game.

1848
02:26:51,000 --> 02:27:02,000
The high level takeaways are challenging content will be in the game, but it's never going to be all skill based again.

1849
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Mechanical mastery is out and your gear is going to be a huge portion of you winning.

1850
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:13,000
What I took from that.

1851
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:20,000
They're really unsure about road maps, but they have no problem making certain promises and keeping them.

1852
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Kind of sounded like a note to me from the road maps.

1853
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
That's how I interpreted the answer.

1854
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:31,000
They said that they block out time for the team to play the game.

1855
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:37,000
For example, he's going to have about 50 hours in season five.

1856
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:42,000
He said that that's by far the best way for the team to learn the game.

1857
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I don't think there's any other way you could in there's no other way to approach the question.

1858
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,000
The only way you will learn is by playing the game.

1859
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:57,000
You will never learn by sitting in an ivory tower theorizing about the game.

1860
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:02,000
This was very refreshing to hear.

1861
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:07,000
This was just me essentially just complaining and I want more qualitative stuff.

1862
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Kind of like maybe this was just me bitching about everything.

1863
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:19,000
The overworlds future was surprising to me.

1864
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,000
This is the most surprising answer.

1865
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:32,000
I said the overworlds really fun to explore the first time or two and then people want to get to their events.

1866
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:37,000
That's probably true.

1867
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
I mean we have a big overworld here.

1868
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:44,000
There's got to be something we can do with it.

1869
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
You're coping.

1870
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:52,000
They said no to instant interactions.

1871
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I don't know if they said no.

1872
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,000
They said that they thought that they could bring it down further.

1873
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I'm pretty sure they said that right that they'd look into bringing it down further.

1874
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Well no guys.

1875
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:11,000
It's not that the overworld is not going to expand.

1876
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:18,000
It's very logical that with the expansion there will be new zones and things to ride around in.

1877
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:23,000
It's not that the overworld is never going to get bigger.

1878
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:30,000
What I was asking them is the overworld is going to be a defining feature of the game.

1879
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Are we going to be spending a lot of time in the overworld for future activities?

1880
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:48,000
What they said was the overworld is kind of a one or two time thing where it's interesting and then people want to get to where they want to go.

1881
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Certainly the overworld will be expanded upon, but that's not the same as is it a defining feature.

1882
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Okay.

1883
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Let's do some polls about how you guys felt.

1884
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:59,000
How did you feel about the interview?

1885
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Everything about it.

1886
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:07,000
How it was done, the questions and the answers.

1887
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Everything is a whole.

1888
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:18,000
You thought it was godly, you thought it was great, you thought it was me, you thought it was terrible, you thought it was horrendous.

1889
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Create the poll.

1890
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Let's pace the poll if you want to vote.

1891
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:29,000
There it is. I pasted it a million times results.

1892
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Let's see.

1893
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:33,000
How did you guys feel about it?

1894
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:46,000
The whole entirety of it, how it was the everything about it, me, all blizzard, everything lumped into one.

1895
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:55,000
All right.

1896
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:13,000
It's pretty good. I'll take that.

1897
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:17,000
That was what I was going to ask from you guys.

1898
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:20,000
What band the 22 people?

1899
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:26,000
I wouldn't give them a band somebody for having an opinion that didn't align with mine.

1900
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:36,000
If people state their opinions and they're different than mine, as long as they aren't being toxic about it, I don't have any problem with them.

1901
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:48,000
It's when people voice opinions to me and they're being toxic about it that I swap them away.

1902
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:57,000
What feedback do you guys have about how it could have been better?

1903
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:02,000
It's really not up to them to do better. It's up to me to do better.

1904
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:16,000
So it could have been a longer interview. What can I do better?

1905
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I need to ask questions quicker.

1906
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Not be a simp. I was being a simp for Diablo 4.

1907
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:35,000
You know, I hear some content creators get called this.

1908
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Some content creators get called a simp. I actually don't get that too much.

1909
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I'm kind of surprised to hear that.

1910
02:33:50,000 --> 02:34:02,000
It's usually just not feedback that I get very often.

1911
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Joe needs to talk less, but here's the thing though.

1912
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:17,000
It's kind of like Adam said at the end of the thing.

1913
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:30,000
I think it is much more helpful to have insights and deep dives into conversations than to do the rapid fire.

1914
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I could have asked 50 questions if I would have done it.

1915
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Will there be charms in Diablo 4?

1916
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Will there be set items in Diablo 4?

1917
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:47,000
But last epoch has set items and they're terrible.

1918
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Diablo 3's entire game is based on overpowered sets and it pretty much ruined the game.

1919
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Diablo 2 has some godly sets and some of them are completely useless, even after the repass of what they did of them.

1920
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:09,000
So when you tell me set, if they would say yes, sets are coming into the game, that doesn't tell me anything.

1921
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:13,000
What I want to know is what do you think about sets?

1922
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Let's have a conversation about what works about sets and what doesn't.

1923
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:27,000
That's the important thing to me.

1924
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:47,000
So when you say Joe talks too much, I would not coach him to talk less because I want to have conversations about it.

1925
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:51,000
One hour is too short of a time to ask detailed questions.

1926
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Most of the segments should be rapid fire, otherwise you don't cover anything.

1927
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
If you had two or three hours, it would have been a different story.

1928
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Barely any questions were covered.

1929
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Yeah, I think that's the main point of feedback is more time.

1930
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Well, some of the questions that I started off with, which I thought were the most important, they already discussed it yesterday.

1931
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:24,000
And I cannot assume that people watched Ryker's interview like I did.

1932
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:30,000
So I wanted to start off with, here's what you guys said already.

1933
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Okay, here's what you said yesterday.

1934
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Now here's my question, here's the part that I'm missing here.

1935
02:36:45,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Yeah, I mean, again, if I could have had a conversation about things when Adam Jackson was talking about balancing the campaign, I mean, I have a pretty simple solution, which I, which I think is, I mean, again, opportunity cost.

1936
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:08,000
How long does it take them to do it versus what's the benefit added?

1937
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:19,000
I can go through, I can go through halty and play for whatever, five hours.

1938
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:31,000
And I'm level 65 and I have a full set of basic ancestral gear and I have two or three legendaries that are good for me.

1939
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:34,000
That's where I get in five hours or something.

1940
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:47,000
And then I go play the campaign and the campaign takes me five hours. And when I'm done with it, I'm level 43 and I have mostly yellows and two legendaries.

1941
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:58,000
And then I say, okay, if you design, redesign the campaign completely with all the new smart loot and this or that or this or that, then it's a huge undertaking, right?

1942
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:04,000
So what about this? Lead the campaign as it is. Forget it. Just leave it as it is.

1943
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:23,000
And the only thing that you do is cut out some of the ridiculous parts like maybe walking around the snake 300 times or the camel escort quest where you're sitting there for 20 minutes, the slowest camel ever following it.

1944
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:39,000
And then you say, all right, the time now is four hours or something or whatever it is. And then you benchmark that compared to about where would you be gear wise and XP wise.

1945
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:54,000
At the end of the run, you could do it. You could do it very cheaply actually. You could just play the campaign. You kill Uber, you kill Lilith at whatever level 42.

1946
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:20,000
And once you kill Lilith, you go to level 60 in world tier four, you just you just ding 60 boom you're 60. You're in world tier four and you get a little good Lilith drops Lilith's goody bag and she drops you a decent set of eye level, whatever 800 and sustrel gear put it on. It's about the same.

1947
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:34,000
That requires almost no changes in the campaign, nothing you didn't change anything. And when you kill Lilith, you just ding roughly the level and roughly the gear that you would have had if you would have played in hell.

1948
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:43,000
That sounds lame though, but that sounds lame to you. People love the campaign.

1949
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:52,000
The whole point is to give another choice. People who say that's lame, that's you.

1950
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:58,000
I would personally love that.

1951
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:01,000
See.

1952
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Some people in Diablo 4 would rather do the campaign again and arrive at the same spot than run 15 helltides.

1953
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:33,000
You're not in the what? Let's not leave it up to interpretation. No guessing. Let's just ask the question.

1954
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Assuming reasonable campaign changes, meaning you don't have to wait for the camel for an hour, which is more fun to level if you arrived at the same point for the same amount of time.

1955
02:40:52,000 --> 02:41:01,000
I don't expect I'm not expecting this poll to be lopsided. I'm expecting it to be a balance.

1956
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Hell tide blasting or the campaign.

1957
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Let's see if I'm wrong. Let's just see what happens. What would be more fun for you?

1958
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I spammed it. What would you rather do if you arrived at the same point and they made some basic quality of life changes to the campaign?

1959
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Okay, I didn't actually expect the campaign to win, but...

1960
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:43,000
This is what I expected it to not have a landslide victory for either of them.

1961
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:52,000
So what someone says is stupid to you is way more fun for 420 people, KW.

1962
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:05,000
You

1963
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
You

1964
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Guys, another thing is

1965
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:56,000
This is this if they took this development time other than the opportunity cost of development time on some other feature.

1966
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:12,000
This situation is just a win for everybody. Even if you're just hell tide blasting, it does not hurt you for the campaign to be an equally viable option for the people that want to play this game.

1967
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,000
What's the problem?

1968
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:22,000
And guys, some people say, Rax, your solution is really lame.

1969
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:26,000
You just beat the campaign, you ding 60 and you get a goody bag.

1970
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Yeah, I mean, that's pretty lame. That's not as good as them redefining the whole campaign and putting in special loot drops to align and making it perfect.

1971
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:46,000
But the entire point of why you wouldn't get this change is the dev time opportunity cost, right?

1972
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:58,000
It takes a million years to fix that, whereas if they just did a gooy bag and made you ding a certain level, then they could implement it maybe in a day.

1973
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:02,000
And then if they can fix it later.

1974
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Right now you're not going to get night now if you do the campaign, you don't get anything. You don't get jack shit.

1975
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:13,000
You don't get any XP and you don't get anything. It's a huge, huge, not even close to hell tide.

1976
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Stop wasting time on meaningless garbage. Jesus, the game has much bigger problems than this.

1977
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Some of you guys.

1978
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Some of you guys.

1979
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:41,000
I know fourth grade was hard.

1980
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:50,000
It's hard to cover a lot of different ideas and aspects of a topic.

1981
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:55,000
I know that that can get really complicated for some people.

1982
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I can see the smoke coming out of some of their ears from all the way over here.

1983
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:13,000
That's why I'm saying fussy. That's why I included this portion to expedite the campaign on a replay a little bit.

1984
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:16,000
We don't have to walk the camel again.

1985
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Wait, there's a fourth grade after fifth grade.

1986
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Fourth grade is coming, man. And for some of the people in chat, it's where their journey ended.

1987
02:45:46,000 --> 02:46:05,000
I like the camel. Don't take it away from us. Well, we just proved today that Satan does exist. Drag a shot right there.

1988
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:11,000
He's a shot right there. Like the camel. Satan does exist, guys.

1989
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:33,000
They should have an uber fight of the camel and you have to walk him across the desert in it's kind of like a Mario Kart race.

1990
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:40,000
The timing is really, really precise. You need like frame perfect inputs to get the camel to turn left and right.

1991
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Yeah, and there needs to be landmines.

1992
02:46:51,000 --> 02:47:00,000
And if you successfully beat it, then you unlock a key to go into the catacombs to fight uber tomb lord.

1993
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:06,000
And uber tomb lord's mount is the camel.

1994
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:39,000
The inner US already over. Yeah, if you blinked, it's already over. Rob just sent me a clip. I don't know what this is. Let's just click it.

1995
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:49,000
So we ended up putting it in a place where like the tier 200 pit is like around tier 150 pit is like close to where AOS was.

1996
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:58,000
You know, for like tier 25, AOS. Yes. And two or 200 goes beyond that. That is insane. Scaling has been. Oh my god. Thank you so much.

1997
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank

1998
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:58,000
you super and deeper deeper. Thank you super and deeper. You know but there's you but we do want to have these like really really difficult. So we have these like really difficult. So we have these like really difficult. We do want to put these like really difficult. So we ended up putting it a place where like the tear to you."PIG and PIG smiles. If the, if the barb is happy. Then we're happy. If the barb is happy. Then we're happy.

1999
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:05,000
We got a message from Adam Fletcher.

2000
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I know that you had a ton of additional stuff.

2001
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Maybe we can do this again sooner rather than later and we can hit up even more of your

2002
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
questions.

2003
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:20,000
All right.

2004
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:24,000
I mean, I got questions.

2005
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:31,000
I can come up with another hundred questions.

2006
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Adam to save the day.

2007
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
Rob probably loves the camel.

2008
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:51,000
He better not.

2009
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Maybe better not.

2010
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Okay.

2011
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Should I call Adam and Joe?

2012
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
I guess three later.

2013
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Let's go.

2014
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Let's go again.

2015
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Part two.

2016
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Okay.

2017
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:30,000
I didn't know this.

2018
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,000
It's Rob's birthday today.

2019
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,000
I have nine, huh?

2020
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:40,000
It's his birthday.

2021
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:48,000
31.

2022
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:56,000
That's one foot in the grave.

2023
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Should I just when DM's interview starts, should I call them?

2024
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Be like, what?

2025
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:02,000
No.

2026
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:03,000
You guys got your schedules confused.

2027
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
This interview was my interview.

2028
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Part two.

2029
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,000
DM's is later.

2030
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:08,000
The back.

2031
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:09,000
Okay.

2032
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:10,000
And then DM's going to be like, what the hell?

2033
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,000
I'm kidding.

2034
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,000
I'll just send DM my questions.

2035
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:15,000
He'll do a good job.

2036
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Excuse me.

2037
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:20,000
I'm 34.

2038
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:21,000
How are you even alive?

2039
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:25,000
I'm 37, by the way.

2040
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
There's DM right there.

2041
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Please no.

2042
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
DM.

2043
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
I'm sure you have a list of questions.

2044
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Would you like another list of questions that I didn't get to get to?

2045
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:41,000
To add to your list?

2046
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Dude, 45 minutes, man.

2047
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Is not enough time.

2048
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Send them your way.

2049
02:51:58,000 --> 02:51:59,000
You'll carry the torch.

2050
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:00,000
All right.

2051
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Fix this document.

2052
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:04,000
In fact, I'm going to do it right now.

2053
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:07,000
I already asked this.

2054
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:11,000
I already asked this.

2055
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Well, let me do it this way.

2056
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:17,000
I already asked about aspirational content.

2057
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:22,000
I already asked them about the roadmap.

2058
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:25,000
I already asked them about feedback.

2059
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:28,000
I already asked them about the state of nightmare dungeons.

2060
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:34,000
I already asked them about the overworld future.

2061
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:38,000
I asked them about the pit.

2062
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
Didn't ask them this.

2063
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:45,000
These are all done.

2064
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:51,000
I already asked those.

2065
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
This was kind of asked already.

2066
02:52:53,000 --> 02:53:04,000
I wanted to prod at them deeper, but I'm just going to delete this question.

2067
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
I'm not sure if DM was aware of this.

2068
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Maybe this question doesn't make any sense anymore.

2069
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:12,000
I'm just going to delete it.

2070
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Charms.

2071
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:14,000
This is a good one.

2072
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
That's a good one to ask.

2073
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:17,000
All right.

2074
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,000
All right.

2075
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:24,000
I already asked.

2076
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:33,000
I asked all of these.

2077
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:34,000
So this is all.

2078
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:38,000
I already asked this.

2079
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:42,000
I already asked this.

2080
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Didn't ask that.

2081
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
I want to know this.

2082
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:53,000
I want to know what their target audience is for Diablo 4.

2083
02:53:53,000 --> 02:54:00,000
This is already listed above.

2084
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Okay.

2085
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:02,000
Yeah.

2086
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Here you go.

2087
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Anything in anything in orange.

2088
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:32,000
I already asked.

2089
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:37,000
CJ had some extra questions as well.

2090
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:38,000
Okay.

2091
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Let me share this with DM here.

2092
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:55,000
All right.

2093
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:59,000
There you go, man.

2094
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:00,000
He has it.

2095
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
There you go.

2096
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Yeah.

2097
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:06,000
That's another question.

2098
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:07,000
I should have asked.

2099
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Why is everything red?

2100
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I asked about the armory and they gave me a little smile and they said, we like the idea

2101
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:27,000
of the armory and we know people want it.

2102
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:32,000
That's usually their cutie-pity way of saying that it's probably maybe coming soon.

2103
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:42,000
That maybe season five.

2104
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
How am I feeling about the pit difficulty?

2105
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Yeah.

2106
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Like I said, live on the interview, if tier 25 is 150 and 200 is beyond, Abattoir tier 25

2107
02:55:52,000 --> 02:56:00,000
with the bug fixes and with the balance changes, that should be in theory extremely difficult.

2108
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:15,000
When will North War release his guides?

2109
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:18,000
I know he has a lot of guides to work on.

2110
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:24,000
I don't know the exact timing, but I do know that I don't know the exact timing, but I do

2111
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:27,000
know that the Maxwell people have been blasting.

2112
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Obviously, before the season comes out on Tuesday, the Maxwell team has been blasting

2113
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:40,000
to get the D4 guides out.

2114
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Please tell me I will not be playing hardcore in Diablo 4.

2115
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:55,000
I'm 1,000% going hardcore SSF and it is very, very likely that I will die, very likely.

2116
02:56:55,000 --> 02:57:00,000
I did a couple of practice runs on the PTR with the no cheat death changes.

2117
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
I did not survive a single run.

2118
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,000
I died on every single time.

2119
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:08,000
And I know Diablo 4 pretty well.

2120
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:12,000
You want another cute thing about me playing hardcore next season?

2121
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:15,000
I have never fought an Uber boss.

2122
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
I've never fought Uber and Dariel.

2123
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:20,000
I've never fought Uber.

2124
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
I don't even know their names.

2125
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:23,000
I'm a fighting man.

2126
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I never fought Uber or Zero.

2127
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:27,000
I've never fought them.

2128
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Not even one time to test them.

2129
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Now I will, I fought.

2130
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Is there a 200 version of Dariel as well?

2131
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:46,000
Okay.

2132
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
I will almost certainly die.

2133
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:52,000
I didn't survive one speed run in the PTR.

2134
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:56,000
I died on every single one.

2135
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:03,000
I'm probably going to play, well, first of all, I'll play every class because again, I've

2136
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
said this like five times today, but I'm a loser.

2137
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:14,000
So I'll play everything except maybe Rogue, but maybe I'll play Rogue too.

2138
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
I'm probably going to start Necro.

2139
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
I haven't started Necro.

2140
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:24,000
I don't know if I've ever started Necro and I really want to play with the minions.

2141
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:27,000
I think the minions are going to be fun as hell.

2142
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:28,000
Why not Rogue?

2143
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Rogue didn't get many like exciting changes.

2144
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:52,000
I tried several speed leveling things and I died on every single one of them.

2145
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,000
I hate minions.

2146
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:56,000
It's not that I hate minions.

2147
02:58:56,000 --> 02:59:06,000
It's I hate minions where I'm a babysitter and not the commander of the undead.

2148
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:11,000
If my minions are dumb as hell and not and I have to do a ton of things to make them do

2149
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:22,000
anything, then yes, I hate minions.

2150
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
What time is DM's interview?

2151
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:27,000
I don't know.

2152
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:30,000
He tweeted it, didn't he?

2153
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:31,000
I'm such a Twitter new.

2154
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:36,000
I don't even know how to look people up here.

2155
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Search, search, Darth, Micro here.

2156
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:51,000
One PM Pacific.

2157
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
One PM Pacific.

2158
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:58,000
So exactly 24 hours from now.

2159
02:59:58,000 --> 02:59:59,000
I believe.

2160
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:34,000
And I hype for May 14th.

2161
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
I am just going to be fun.

2162
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:39,000
I'm almost certainly going to die, but I don't care.

2163
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:40,000
I'll just make another character.

2164
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
We go again.

2165
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:54,000
You watch the interview already a second time and I was too hard for myself.

2166
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,000
My phrasing was well done.

2167
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Makes for saying that, man.

2168
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Appreciate it.

2169
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Yeah, I just didn't.

2170
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Time was the limiting factor there.

2171
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Is there any need to keep aspects on old characters to migrate them over to the new system in season

2172
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:23,000
four?

2173
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:28,000
You can mind the new system is very seamless, right?

2174
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
You run around, you pick up legendaries.

2175
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Okay, you take a look.

2176
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:35,000
If it's not better than yours, essentially if it doesn't have a greater ethics, you just

2177
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:36,000
salvage it.

2178
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Is this going to chain?

2179
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:42,000
Is this going to start chain upgrading your codex of power seamlessly?

2180
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:46,000
I don't think you need to save stuff and salvage it and anything like that.

2181
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:50,000
I think you just play and your codex is going to get filled out pretty easily.

2182
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Yeah, that's a good way to phrase it.

2183
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:08,000
One of the biggest values there is the humanizing of the Blizzard entity or the Diablo 4 entity.

2184
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:13,000
You get to speak to the people in plain English.

2185
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:19,000
The real advantage here, the difference between this and a campfire chat for me is they're

2186
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:26,000
willing to just sit there and say, what is the community want to talk about?

2187
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:32,000
And I tried to make my questions a little bit pointed.

2188
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:40,000
If I leave the question super open ended, then we can get a very, very high level glazing

2189
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:43,000
of ideas.

2190
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:48,000
But if I say, I want to talk to you about pinnacle content.

2191
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:51,000
You said this didn't work.

2192
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:59,000
You said this is going to be a bigger factor than x is going to be a bigger factor than y.

2193
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:07,000
Have you considered z specifically for this content and what does the team think about that?

2194
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:12,000
Then we can start to dig at what are we actually getting at here?

2195
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:32,000
Right, when you leave it very open, it's not even like a negative.

2196
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:40,000
When you leave a topic wide open, they will respond similarly to how they have always

2197
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:41,000
responded.

2198
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:42,000
Right?

2199
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:47,000
If I say, what did you guys think about the PTR?

2200
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
They have already said a hundred times.

2201
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
We really liked the PTR.

2202
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:54,000
We got so much feedback.

2203
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:58,000
Thank you for participating on the PTR.

2204
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:06,000
But I could ask them, what kind of feedback from the PTR seem to be the most valuable to

2205
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
you?

2206
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:14,000
What kinds of things surprised you when you started that can catenate the data and start

2207
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:18,000
to make some decisions about it?

2208
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:19,000
That's better.

2209
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:25,000
We're actually going to learn something out of it.

2210
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
Rax plays soft course.

2211
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:30,000
You can do community, duriel and and arial runs.

2212
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:44,000
The problem is, the problem is, when I, if I do that, whenever

2213
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:52,000
I have ever done a community run, I have always required myself to pay my own way, unless

2214
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:55,000
someone comes into my stream and says, Rax, I'm literally quitting.

2215
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:58,000
I'm going to go play a wow season of discovery.

2216
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
If you want my 50 mats, you can take them.

2217
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
If not, they're going to rot in my chest.

2218
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:03,000
Okay.

2219
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:06,000
If you're actually quitting, whatever, I'll take them.

2220
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:14,000
But in general, if I just log in, what you guys will do because you guys are so nice,

2221
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:21,000
is you guys will pay for me to run duriel 10,000 times until I have every uber unique

2222
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
because you're very nice.

2223
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:32,000
But if I do that, I'm missing the most important thing about my stream and as a player, I miss

2224
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:35,000
being relatable.

2225
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:40,000
If I just use streamer privilege to just get handed everything, first of all, the game

2226
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:43,000
is boring because I didn't earn anything.

2227
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:47,000
The second thing is, I'm not relatable.

2228
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:51,000
You guys don't have, a lot of you don't have a thousand million people that are willing

2229
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:54,000
to just hand you everything.

2230
03:05:54,000 --> 03:06:06,000
When you're trying content and you have a stick and I have X-caliber, it's not relatable.

2231
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:09,000
That's why I don't do that.

2232
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:26,000
Or if I participate in community events, I pay my own way every time.

2233
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
Am I not trying to be Rob?

2234
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:32,000
Guys, I'm not needling Rob or people are saying ask me, Gold.

2235
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:38,000
I'm not giving this answer to disrespect other people or their decisions.

2236
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:45,000
I was asked a question, I'm responding to the answer for me.

2237
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:56,000
They can do whatever they want.

2238
03:06:56,000 --> 03:07:08,000
Interview already happened.

2239
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Here's an interesting thing.

2240
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
We just made this.

2241
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:15,000
This is going to be the timestamps of the interview on YouTube.

2242
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:22,000
This is interesting because let's look at the time spent on each topic.

2243
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
The problem is, this question had a lot of setup.

2244
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:30,000
I spent at least one minute setting up the question from CJ's interview.

2245
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:37,000
Let's say about four minutes on road map, four minutes on political content, four minutes

2246
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:43,000
on road map, 11 minutes on feedback from the community.

2247
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:55,000
Wow, 11 minutes.

2248
03:07:55,000 --> 03:08:01,000
We spent one, we spent one fourth of the time talking about how they process feedback and

2249
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:08,000
how they test the game.

2250
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:12,000
Armory 42 seconds.

2251
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:22,000
This was the rapid fire thing though.

2252
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:25,000
You got to talk faster, ask speed run questions.

2253
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
I mean, I was trying, man.

2254
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:28,000
I was trying.

2255
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:46,000
I wasn't yapping fast enough.

2256
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:50,000
What stood out the most, probably the feedback section, the fact that they said that they

2257
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:55,000
build in time for all the developers to play the game to learn the game.

2258
03:08:55,000 --> 03:09:01,000
I would say that was the best news for me out of all of it.

2259
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
I think that let's do one more poll.

2260
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:07,000
I don't want to become a poll Andy.

2261
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
I do have a question.

2262
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:17,000
For those that watch the interview, let's see, what was the best information about or

2263
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:22,000
from the interview?

2264
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:30,000
The devs play the game every day.

2265
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:33,000
What are some other choices?

2266
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:44,000
The pit actually having difficulty.

2267
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:47,000
The overworld being dead.

2268
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:52,000
It sounded like an armory is coming.

2269
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:59,000
Armory coming we think.

2270
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:00,000
For towels next to the bed.

2271
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:41,000
Yeah, they actually feedback listen to from all sources.

2272
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:42,000
I mean, that's good enough.

2273
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:44,000
We don't have to fish for these.

2274
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:46,000
Let's just go with this.

2275
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:51,000
Which of these four, would you say was the best news that out of these four choices,

2276
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
to spam the poll in the chat?

2277
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:58,000
If you care to answer.

2278
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:13,000
All right.

2279
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:32,000
So people are what I'm gathering from this is people are excited about different things.

2280
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:35,000
It was a little bit more balanced than I thought it was going to be.

2281
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:16,000
I wonder why that is.

2282
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:18,000
Why would they block that?

2283
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:21,000
It's like to protect the integrity of the poll or something.

2284
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:06,000
Devs play the game every day is not a best info.

2285
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:09,000
That is their obligation.

2286
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:14,000
I don't know if every gaming studio blocks out a certain portion of their day every day

2287
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
to just play the game.

2288
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:22,000
I wouldn't say that's an obligation is a stretch, but I'm glad that they do it.

2289
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:38,000
The people actually think that the devs don't play the game.

2290
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:42,000
I think most people thought that the devs play the game, but there's a huge difference

2291
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:51,000
between playing the game and your entire dev team as part of their daily job plays 50

2292
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:59,000
hours of the new season each before releasing it to the public.

2293
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:13,000
I think that's not those are not the same thing.

2294
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:14,000
I was not expecting that.

2295
03:14:21,000 --> 03:14:26,000
What is SSF?

2296
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:27,000
Solo self-found.

2297
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:31,000
All right.

2298
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
There's so many people here.

2299
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:37,000
I would love to just blast all day, but I actually think I'm going to relax a little

2300
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:38,000
bit.

2301
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:42,000
I could stream all day, guys, but I think I'm going to wrap it up here.

2302
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
I'm going to raid Rob because it's his birthday.

2303
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:45,000
Let's raid Rob.

2304
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:46,000
Wish him happy birthday.

2305
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:49,000
See what he thinks.

2306
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:50,000
Really appreciated you guys being here.

2307
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:52,000
You guys left a lot of comments.

2308
03:14:52,000 --> 03:15:02,000
I took the top five comments on YouTube and I blocked out time to ask your questions.

2309
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:06,000
Probably the most insulting thing, the thing that pisses me off that people talk shit

2310
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,000
about me all the time, and that's fine.

2311
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:09,000
You're a streamer.

2312
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:10,000
That's what's going to happen.

2313
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:16,000
The one thing that pisses me off the most is when people say that I don't care about

2314
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:17,000
the community.

2315
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:20,000
I don't represent the community in any way.

2316
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:22,000
I don't give a shit about the casuals.

2317
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:25,000
I only care about the blasters.

2318
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:27,000
It's complete horse shit.

2319
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:32,000
That's why I let you guys post all of your questions.

2320
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:41,000
And when I'm running out of time, I asked every single one of your top five questions.

2321
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
I didn't do it as a PR move.

2322
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:46,000
I did it to make sure that your questions got answered.

2323
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:50,000
That's the thing that if you really want to piss me off is saying something like that

2324
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:51,000
to me.

2325
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
One guy, know it happens a lot, my friend.

2326
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:54,000
Trust me.

2327
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:57,000
You wouldn't believe how much people talk shit about me.

2328
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
But I'm not going to focus on that.

2329
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:02,000
Today was a great day.

2330
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:07,000
But remember this, for all the people that say I don't care.

2331
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:11,000
I asked the top five questions from YouTube and I didn't have an opportunity to ask many

2332
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:12,000
questions.

2333
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:19,000
Rob's still streaming.

2334
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:20,000
Yeah.

2335
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:21,000
Okay.

2336
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:24,000
Thank you so much, guys.

2337
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:25,000
I appreciate it.

2338
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:29,000
Tomorrow, I'll probably play Diablo IV.

2339
03:16:29,000 --> 03:16:30,000
I haven't played in a long time.

2340
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:33,000
I mean, I'll be honest with you.

2341
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:37,000
The five-year-old in me just wants to keep playing Elden Ring.

2342
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:41,000
But I'll probably play Diablo IV.

2343
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:46,000
My theory crafts and things might look at some Max Roll builds.

2344
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:54,000
I need to make a tier list.

2345
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:55,000
It's just so hard to say, man.

2346
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:58,000
It's so hard to say that the tier list, I'm going to make it just because people like the

2347
03:16:58,000 --> 03:17:00,000
video, but it's so hard to say.

2348
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:03,000
I'll see you tomorrow, Frosty.

2349
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:08,000
Frosty, hopefully you got some ultimate mean content from that.

2350
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:11,000
You already know Frosty is brewing something.

2351
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:14,000
Thanks for being here, guys.

2352
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:17,000
By the way, there were a million superchats, subs.

2353
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:20,000
Flip said, hey, I am watching your Elden Ring playthrough.

2354
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:22,000
You can only play the game once for the first time.

2355
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:23,000
Thanks to the creators.

2356
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:26,000
I can watch someone else experiencing for the first time.

2357
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:28,000
Thank you for uploading it to YouTube and bless you.

2358
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:30,000
Thank you, man.

2359
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:32,000
Flip I hope you're here.

2360
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:36,000
If you're not here, I'm going to private message you just to make sure.

2361
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:39,000
Sorry, I didn't see that until now.

2362
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:44,000
Everybody on YouTube, thanks for all the subs, thanks for the likes, thanks to the superchats,

2363
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:45,000
thanks for everything.

2364
03:17:45,000 --> 03:17:47,000
Sorry, I was super tunnel visioned on the stream today.

2365
03:17:47,000 --> 03:17:50,000
I wasn't even looking at the notifications today.

2366
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:53,000
I'll do better.

2367
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:57,000
I got to the end of the Final Fantasy VII rebirth and then I just stopped playing it.

2368
03:17:57,000 --> 03:18:03,000
I'm literally at the point where the bad thing happens and I'm at the point where the bad

2369
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,000
thing happens and I just stopped playing.

2370
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:11,000
I don't know, it's just not the same as Final Fantasy VII, man.

2371
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:12,000
Have a great night guys.

2372
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:13,000
See you tomorrow.

2373
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:18,000
See you tomorrow.
