1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Just getting music on here.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Justango, how are we doing, buddy?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm good, guys.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Can I ask you guys a question?

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Do you guys ever wake up in the morning and ask yourselves,

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
why am I not playing Elden Ring?

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Every morning.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He's locked in, chat.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Two bits.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How are we doing, buddy?

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You weren't a fan of Elden Ring?

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Really?

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You weren't a fan of Elden Ring?

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Really?

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Really?

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Really?

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Right.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Could see you ever 다음, buddy.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you.

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you.

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you.

24
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you.

25
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you.

26
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you.

27
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you.

28
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you.

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We're on here.

30
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We have fun.

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Thank you.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Thank you.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you.

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you.

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll give you all the answers.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's on our radar.

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, I want to get inside the minds of the devs.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I want to know their approach to things.

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't want to know.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm not going to ask yes or no questions.

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When can we save builds?

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I think they already answered that.

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
They said that they like the idea of an armory.

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They like the idea of an armory.

50
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And...

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It just wasn't the top priority for them to get into the game.

52
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But maybe I can reiterate that it was the top question.

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, let's not use the ats because that's stupid.

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What is it?

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
CP max 205 or something?

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
CP max 205 or something?

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And then Sergeant Turtle 3 3.

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Every single one of these questions I already had on my list except this one.

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Are there questions related to endgame improvement?

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, so I guess I can walk you guys through my questions that I have so far.

64
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You would be shocked.

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I actually spent a lot of time on this.

66
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm trying to be as prepared as possible.

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm going to need to clean this up and potentially grab more questions from you guys.

68
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

69
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Actually, let me change my mind.

70
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let me do a little bit more work here and then I'll ask you guys because it's not quite

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
complete yet.

72
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

73
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So they talked about set items yesterday.

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They said that set items are a fan favorite.

75
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They said that there is, if you think about a character's power, it's a slice of pizza.

76
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
A slice goes to skills and paragon and uniques and aspects and the affixes and whatever.

77
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If sets come into the game, then it's going to take up a slice of the pizza.

78
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So, how much of the pizza should it take is what they were talking about.

79
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So, one thing that they said is there's no point to implement set items if they're too

80
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
weak.

81
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I strongly agree here.

82
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Look at the super shitty sets.

83
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I love pizza.

84
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's what I took it from as well.

85
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's what I took from it as well.

86
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So, if you look at like Last Epoch, for example, they released sets.

87
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Most of them are completely worthless.

88
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I actually just filter out set items in my loot filter.

89
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I just filter them out.

90
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
A lot of them in Diablo 2, you find a lot of low level set items.

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They're useless.

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You just go into the Black Marsh, you get your, what's it called?

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Your stealth.

94
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Then you make your two spirit items.

95
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And we ain't got no time for any of these sets.

96
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But they also said Diablo 3, too strong.

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And I agree.

98
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So, the thing that I wanted to ask them about is.

99
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If set items come into the game.

100
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Where do they feel.

101
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is the right amount of power.

102
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And item slots taken.

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I can give them three examples of sets that I think worked beautifully.

104
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So, in Diablo 3, a good example of a set is maybe Captain Crimson's.

105
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
All guilds.

106
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And, uh, Guardians.

107
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They barely take up any slots.

108
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And they're.

109
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They have different use cases.

110
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So, Guardians is for early game.

111
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Crap and Crimson's is if you want cooldown.

112
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And all guilds is if you want damage.

113
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And another really good example, in my opinion.

114
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Is Diablo 2's Tal Rasha set.

115
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And the reason why is it's.

116
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's an end game godly set.

117
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But not game breaking.

118
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And two pieces are.

119
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Very rare, but not impossible to find the amulet and the chest.

120
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The chest is super difficult.

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But the amulet is very accessible.

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The.

123
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is my example of the three best sets I've ever seen in a game.

124
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you guys agree that these sets would.

125
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
These sets are well designed.

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Don't break the game and add some flavor to the game.

127
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Can you move away from turning D4 into D2 and D3 questions?

128
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
DF.

129
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I got four pages of questions here.

130
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I got four pages.

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm asking questions about Diablo 4.

132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The questions are about Diablo 4.

133
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But I will draw analogies to many other games.

134
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I even have a question about Diablo 4 specific unique ideas.

135
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I've put in a shitload of effort into this document, man.

136
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Trust me.

137
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not talking about the other games.

138
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But we can bring up tons of analogies to other games.

139
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The interview.

140
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There was an interview yesterday from Riker.

141
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We're going to.

142
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We're going to talk about.

143
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We're going to talk about that.

144
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Okay.

145
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Here's my question on rumors.

146
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They said yesterday.

147
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
They like rune words and they see a future.

148
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
See a future in D4.

149
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They are.

150
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They are.

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They initially had rune words coming in.

152
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But they didn't have time to finish them.

153
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But here's the problem.

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Here's the thing for.

155
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Here's the thing for me about rune words.

156
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Rune words to me again is an iconic system.

157
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Iconic system of D2.

158
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But the announcement that they had for rune words.

159
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wasn't rune words.

160
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It was like.

161
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It was like a prefix and a suffix.

162
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And it was like.

163
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
A totally.

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
New system.

165
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
With the same name.

166
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So my question is.

167
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
When the team talks about.

168
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The work that you've already done on rune words.

169
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You.

170
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You.

171
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You.

172
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You.

173
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You.

174
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You.

175
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You.

176
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And.

177
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You.

178
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't have a specific kind of statement.

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm going to try it Pavlik.

180
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
More人民.

181
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Which has a specificAttackgebra and a way.

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Do you try critically.

183
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But if.

184
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And.

185
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The.

186
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Can it.

187
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You.

188
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Your privilege.

189
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Thanks.

190
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The other main meta monesses.

191
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The.

192
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You tá.

193
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The.

194
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Open Up.

195
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The.

196
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
For BIOS platform.

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
이쪽.

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This.

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Um.

200
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The IP.

201
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
On.

202
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Your hac.

203
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
with a different direction.

204
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Because this is the thing that threw off the community the most

205
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
when they initially announced this.

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
They said, RuneWords are coming to Diablo 4,

207
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and then they showed us what it looked like,

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and it wasn't RuneWords at all.

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It wasn't.

210
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So I want to know,

211
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
it sounds like it may be coming sometime in the future.

212
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
If it comes in the future,

213
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
are you starting with kind of Diablo 2's base of that system

214
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and expanding upon it and changing it and making it

215
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
work in the Diablo 4 universe?

216
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Or are you actually going to give us something different?

217
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The interview's in one hour exactly.

218
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay.

219
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
On Riker's interview,

220
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
they took 15 minutes answering each question.

221
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, I watched Riker's interview three times over.

222
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I watched it three times.

223
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm pretty, I would like to think,

224
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
hopefully this is true.

225
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'd like to think I'm pretty prepared today.

226
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I watched it three times.

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's why the title of this is

228
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
CJ's Questions in the Beginning.

229
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I want to,

230
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
and I messaged Blizzard.

231
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I said,

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I would like to continue some of the conversations

233
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
that you guys had.

234
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The interview's in one hour, guys.

235
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,000
One hour.

236
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
They did,

237
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
they talked about all of these.

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
They talked about all of these

239
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
in Riker's interviews, guys.

240
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I know.

241
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I watched it three times.

242
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I know.

243
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I have a different question.

244
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Riker asked,

245
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
are Rune words coming in Diablo 4?

246
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And their answer was,

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
they like Rune words

248
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and they see a future in Diablo 4.

249
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's not my question.

250
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
My question is,

251
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
when Rune words come to Diablo 4,

252
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
are they going to be Rune words

253
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
or are they going to be something different?

254
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Because when they initially announced it,

255
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
it was something different.

256
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's why I want to talk about it, Karaman.

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's why,

258
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that's why it's my first question.

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's exactly why it's up here.

260
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
They talked about aspirational

261
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and pinnacle content

262
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
like three different times.

263
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So,

264
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
so,

265
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
yeah,

266
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,000
yeah,

267
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
both.

268
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It would be both.

269
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay,

270
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,000
charms.

271
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let's say

272
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
last epoch

273
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
we get our,

274
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,000
so,

275
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
so,

276
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
PoE

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
D3

278
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
don't have them.

279
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
D2

280
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
has them

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
no in,

282
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
with no

283
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
with no

284
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
dedicated

285
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
inventory.

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Last epoch

287
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
has them

288
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
with a dedicated

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
inventory.

290
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Will they

291
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,000
ever

292
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
come to

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
D4?

294
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
If yes,

295
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
would they have

296
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
a dedicated

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,000
inventory?

298
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I already

299
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
have that

300
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,000
as a question,

301
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Luna.

302
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
When is Diablo

303
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
coming to Diablo

304
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
for?

305
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:37,000
if Joe is smart,

306
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
he would be,

307
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
he would be in the chat

308
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
taking notes

309
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
to prepare.

310
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,000
there.

311
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So,

312
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
let me,

313
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
let me,

314
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
let me,

315
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
let me clarify

316
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
this situation

317
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
here,

318
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,000
guys.

319
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
never actually,

320
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,000
like,

321
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
individually or

322
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
one-on-one

323
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
too much,

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
but I have

325
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
been talking

326
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
to more

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Joe than

328
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Adam,

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,000
but some

330
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Adam as

331
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,000
well.

332
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I've been

333
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
talking to

334
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,000
them for a

335
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
long time.

336
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Me,

337
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Joe,

338
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and Adam

339
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
had a

340
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
lengthy

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
conversation

342
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
about how

343
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,000
great

344
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Elden Ring

345
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,000
is and

346
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
how all

347
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,000
great

348
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
all the

349
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Souls games

350
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
are.

351
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
By the way,

352
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I think both

353
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Joe and

354
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Adam beat

355
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
every single

356
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Souls game.

357
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Bloodborne,

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
all three of

359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the Dark Souls,

360
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and Elden Ring.

361
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So,

362
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
they're gamers,

363
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,000
right?

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I am not

365
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
going into

366
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
this interview

367
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
with a

368
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
machine gun

369
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
looking for

370
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,000
blood,

371
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
right?

372
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm not

373
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,000
looking to

374
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
embarrass them.

375
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm not

376
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
looking to

377
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,000
put,

378
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
you know,

379
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
uneasy

380
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
pressure on

381
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,000
them.

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What I want

383
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,000
to do is

384
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I would just

385
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,000
like to get

386
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
some answers

387
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,000
for the

388
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
public on

389
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
the most

390
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
pressing

391
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,000
questions,

392
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,000
right?

393
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I want to

394
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
know,

395
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
what is

396
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,000
in their

397
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
minds and

398
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,000
on the

399
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
team's

400
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
minds for

401
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
the future

402
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,000
of the

403
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,000
game.

404
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So,

405
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
that way,

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,000
we can

407
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
estimate

408
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
what we

409
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
are going

410
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,000
to be

411
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
getting out

412
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
of Diablo

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,000
4.

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Honestly,

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I think

416
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
this interview

417
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
might have

418
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
some impact

419
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
for some

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,000
people on

421
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
whether they

422
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,000
buy the

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
expansion or

424
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,000
not.

425
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Because if

426
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
people like

427
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
what they're

428
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,000
hearing about

429
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
the future

430
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,000
of Diablo

431
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
4,

432
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
maybe they

433
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
will have

434
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
more confidence

435
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
in purchasing

436
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,000
the expansion.

437
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You know

438
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,000
what I

439
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,000
mean?

440
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So,

441
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
this interview

442
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
is not

443
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
my personal

444
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
opportunity to

445
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
get answers to

446
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
these questions.

447
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This interview

448
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
is to go

449
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,000
out in

450
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
public with

451
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,000
a bunch of

452
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
lovely people

453
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
like yourselves

454
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and ask

455
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,000
them some

456
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
deep questions

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and see so

458
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
everyone else

459
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
can hear all

460
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,000
the answers.

461
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm not

462
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
going in

463
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
here for

464
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
looking for

465
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
blood

466
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
necessarily.

467
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You lost

468
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
10 million

469
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,000
runes today.

470
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Can't you

471
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,000
just go pick

472
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
them up

473
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,000
though?

474
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,000
No.

475
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Maybe just

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
some bruising.

477
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Any question

478
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,000
regarding

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
PvP?

480
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
No.

481
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Let's put

482
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,000
this in

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
here.

484
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:57,000
could ask

485
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,000
that.

486
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Give me a

487
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
second here.

488
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Rob sent

489
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
me a message

490
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and said,

491
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Rax,

492
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
if you can

493
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,000
squeeze these

494
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
two questions

495
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and get

496
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
them in.

497
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
so let's

498
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
try to

499
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,000
ask them.

500
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Yeah.

501
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So,

502
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,000
okay,

503
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,000
let's go

504
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
up here

505
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,000
for a

506
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,000
second.

507
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay.

508
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Let's go

509
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
up here

510
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
for a

511
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,000
second.

512
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Okay.

513
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Let's go

514
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
up here

515
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,000
for a second.

516
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Okay.

517
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh,

518
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,000
then,

519
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I have

520
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Ru application

521
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
of the

522
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,000
name.

523
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You.

524
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You.

525
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You.

526
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You.

527
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You.

528
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You.

529
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You.

530
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You.

531
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You.

532
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You.

533
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You.

534
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You.

535
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You.

536
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You.

537
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You.

538
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Right here.

539
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Got five questions in.

540
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Well, I have one, two, three, four, five, six.

541
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I have six, well, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

542
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I have seven questions that came directly from CJ's interview follow ups to questions that

543
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
CJ asked.

544
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And then I have two other additional things.

545
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And then I have many, many.

546
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Here's another five questions.

547
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I really want to know this.

548
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
A lot of people in the community say Blizzard never tests anything that they, that they do.

549
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
They just throw stuff into the game.

550
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We're the beta testers, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

551
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And I think we, I think people deep down know that that is not true.

552
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So I would like to know how does testing work for Blizzard?

553
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You have an idea for something.

554
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, we're going to do the avatar.

555
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Fine.

556
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You put together like the monsters and the layouts and maybe you get it into like a testing phase.

557
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Then like what, what happens?

558
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What is the internal process for testing?

559
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
What's that?

560
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Another question that I wanted to ask at some point.

561
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I can delete all of this.

562
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Another question I wanted to ask is Microsoft's impact.

563
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I don't really know, though, because the problem with this kind of a question,

564
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
the impact on game development, here's the problem, though.

565
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I don't know if we're ever going to get an answer here.

566
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Because if Microsoft negatively impacted their development, they would never say it.

567
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
They're either going to say, Microsoft is great, we love them,

568
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
or that's not true and they're not going to answer it.

569
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I guess we could ask it a different way, though, that's not offensive.

570
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Maybe we could say the Microsoft takeover.

571
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And then I guess we could ask them, have they mostly been hands-on,

572
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
helping you guys, providing resources, providing guidance,

573
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
guidance, or are they very hands-off, letting you guys do your thing,

574
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
they trust you, or is it kind of like a mixture?

575
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:44,000
See, there's two people.

576
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
They already said the Microsoft impact is positive.

577
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
They already said that Microsoft is hands-off.

578
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Not even the internet can agree.

579
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay.

580
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay.

581
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Hey, CJ, can I call you?

582
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
CJ is here.

583
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Wait a minute.

584
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Can I, uh, do you want to chat on Discord for a second?

585
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I watched your interview three times, by the way.

586
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Okay.

587
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You call me, CJ.

588
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You call me.

589
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Okay.

590
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
CJ is here.

591
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Okay.

592
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Let me turn off the music, guys.

593
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Remind me to turn it on.

594
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
CJ is Riker.

595
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Let me message him.

596
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Hmm.

597
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Hmm.

598
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Hmm.

599
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Hmm.

600
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Hmm.

601
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Hmm.

602
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Hmm.

603
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Hmm.

604
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Hmm.

605
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Hmm.

606
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Hmm.

607
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Hmm.

608
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Hmm.

609
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Hmm.

610
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
This will also give me a good chance to, uh, test my Discord audio here.

611
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Hello.

612
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Hello.

613
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Can you hear me?

614
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Hey, Ryan.

615
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,000
How you doing?

616
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yo, can you get, okay.

617
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He's got to be too low, right?

618
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I turned him way up.

619
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Can you give me another one here, CJ?

620
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Check one, two testing one, two.

621
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
How's the volume there guys up down or perfect?

622
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay.

623
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I I'm, I'm actually getting every answer.

624
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Uh, okay.

625
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Let's go up slightly more.

626
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Last try one more time.

627
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Check one, two.

628
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It could also be, maybe I'm a little on the low side.

629
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
How's that?

630
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah.

631
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Okay.

632
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We're good.

633
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Hey man, I watched your interview yesterday.

634
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I don't know, man.

635
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You have like, you have like a flow, like it, you've done this before.

636
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You have like a flow to the conversation that, uh, I don't think I'm going to be able to match, man.

637
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm just rough around the edges.

638
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm just, I'm just diving right in, man.

639
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Now you're going to have a different style and I think it's going to, it's going to be really good that we're each going to have like different kinds of interviews that are going to get different kinds of answers.

640
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Like there are some questions that, um, cause we did like, I kind of what you got, what you're doing here.

641
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We're getting some questions from the audience and I'm like, that's a racks question.

642
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You guys can go ask that tomorrow where I know it's like, it's a bit more granular.

643
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It's a bit more, uh, on point.

644
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So yeah, no, I think, uh, I I'm excited to see, uh, what you, cause you also have Adam Jackson, right?

645
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:48,000
They're bringing in, they know, they know what to expect from you to cover those, those really specific, uh, you know, class, uh, uh, talking points.

646
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh God.

647
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't even want to know what that means, but, uh, um, yeah.

648
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So I watched your interview.

649
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I really liked it again.

650
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I added another page and a half of followup questions to your questions.

651
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Your, your questions were good, but yeah, like, I guess, I guess with my questions, like listening to how you brought them up, I have some like very, very pointed questions.

652
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Like, how do you feel about this?

653
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Um, I guess two questions for you.

654
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
How did you feel about, uh, the interview in general?

655
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And was there any really pressing thing that you wanted to get out of your interview that you didn't have time for that you want me to revisit today?

656
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh, that's a great question.

657
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Uh, I mean, I got through maybe half of the questions.

658
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I was like triaging them as I was going through them.

659
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Um, uh, just cause I was, I was happy with the interview overall.

660
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I, I recognized, uh, that I asked some big questions, especially upfront that necessitated very long answers.

661
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And that's something I need to think about going forward is being able to maybe pepper in the smaller questions, uh, upfront that can give smaller answers just to get more in there.

662
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Like I would have loved to, you know, have hours to talk with Joe, uh, and get through everything and also ask those followup questions and stuff.

663
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But, uh, I know the Microsoft one was something that was high up on the list.

664
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't know.

665
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Like I, I was hearing your concerns and I had those, I was going through that same theory crafting of what can they answer?

666
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
What are they going to answer?

667
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So yeah, possibly one way of framing it would be what if anything has the deal with Microsoft allowed you guys to do now that you couldn't do before.

668
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Cause obviously they're not going to crap talk Microsoft.

669
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Uh, but it's kind of one way to see if their day to day is being impacted, uh, at all by this kind of stuff.

670
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay.

671
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Uh, keep going.

672
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What, what else, what else would you have asked?

673
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This is good.

674
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh, let's see.

675
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Um, one answer that would have been a big, I skipped it.

676
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Cause it would have been another big answer would have been, well, what's like the most challenging part or what has been the most challenging part, uh, to what I'm doing.

677
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm doing a big part, uh, to work on a D four to date that can help give insight.

678
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Like I like to ask questions that get insight into.

679
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Their process.

680
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Cause sometimes, you know, they'll do something and we'll react to it and be like, it'll be obvious on our end or it'll seem straightforward on our end.

681
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But it's cause we don't understand the thinking that went in, went into something.

682
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So I like to ask questions that make me understand what they're thinking.

683
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So sometimes things that seem simple and easy for us to do, like, well, you know, this was easy.

684
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Why don't you just do this?

685
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It's like, Oh, actually that was really challenging to, you know, put together, which could also shed insight into, well, going forward.

686
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Why don't they just do this?

687
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It's just a flipping a switch.

688
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Right.

689
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It's like, well, actually, you know, this and that.

690
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You know, I actually, I actually agree with you.

691
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So a lot of, a lot of people, well, actually not a lot of people, that's not the right way to phrase it.

692
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But some people think that when we have the opportunity, and this is like a rare thing, I don't think I've ever been able to speak to Blizzard freely, openly.

693
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And they're just like, you know, throw whatever you got at us.

694
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And you can look at a snapshot of Diablo four at any point in time and say, I like this.

695
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't like this.

696
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Will you buff this build?

697
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Won't you buff this build?

698
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
This balance is off.

699
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Da da da da da.

700
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But that doesn't help me project how I think the game will be in the future.

701
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The thing that will help me do that is, what do you guys think over there when you're in your chair?

702
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We can see all the Reddit threads of what people think you think.

703
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But what I want to know is, what do you actually think?

704
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And then all of a sudden we can start to figure some things out that will actually happen in Diablo four rather than focusing on a snapshot in time.

705
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's a great way of framing it.

706
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah.

707
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I also like to avoid any questions that are just basically thinly veiled suggestions, because we have our ways to pass our suggestions onto them, right?

708
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
We have platforms.

709
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
We can make a video with suggestions.

710
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
The devs see that.

711
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They hear that.

712
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
An interview is kind of like wasting time basically passing along a suggestion when we know we can get that feedback to them.

713
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah.

714
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You know, I actually watched your interview multiple times.

715
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I watched a little bit of your follow up conversation as well.

716
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
One of the first things that I was going to ask them, you actually touched this multiple times in different areas in your interview.

717
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But talking about kind of like the really end game, the aspirational content.

718
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I heard them say Lilith is was mechanical mastery.

719
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It wasn't based on gear and that it, you know, I agree that most people thought that that wasn't fun.

720
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
But I don't know if it wasn't fun because of the hit boxes of the waves or because it was just challenging.

721
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But then later on, they talked about again, you ask them again about the aspirational or the pinnacle content.

722
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And you said, well, they can make players weaker.

723
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
They can make monsters hit harder.

724
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
They can have more health.

725
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But in general, for it to feel like an ARPG, the decisions that you make before you go into a fight should matter more than in the fight itself.

726
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Because otherwise you're playing like a souls like game.

727
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But they did mention that when they do have aspirational or pinnacle content, if they properly label it to the community, then the backlash actually really isn't there as long as it's properly advertised.

728
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But I would say like, again, my my follow up question to that whole idea there is what about skill, though, because the Uber Lilith was the moment in the game where I feel like I actually triumphed over a tremendous challenge, a peak ahead of me in my Diablo four journey that I finally overcame that I didn't just win because I found a shackle or I got a perfect role.

729
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I actually had to learn some mechanics, play well and win.

730
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I wanted to ask them, is there any plans for stuff like that in the future?

731
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It doesn't have to be a one shot, crazy hitbox, things like that.

732
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But it sounded to me like they were kind of moving away from that entirely.

733
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And that that honestly makes me sad.

734
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I think that's definitely worth asking.

735
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah.

736
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Whether they're planning to add any skill based end game or pinnacle content.

737
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:33,000
One question that I didn't have a chance to ask was, what is your philosophy towards adding new end game activities to kind of get an idea of what kind of new stuff we can expect to come?

738
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Or if even say, like, yeah, no, we're done.

739
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You know, it's this kind of we think we're in a good place now with it.

740
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And, you know, I don't think that's the case, but to try to see where their minds add with regards to what more they're going to add.

741
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Did you see the update from last epoch a few days ago about their one year roadmap?

742
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I I wish I had a chance to.

743
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm definitely going to dive into that before the weekend.

744
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I've just been slammed.

745
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah.

746
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yeah.

747
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Um, so it is a spoiler alert if I tell you a little bit about it right now.

748
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Go ahead.

749
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Please do.

750
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So it in every single quarter, they're making significant improvements to the end game.

751
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Like my title, my title is like, uh, last last epoch update.

752
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And my thumbnail was end game, end game, end game.

753
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,000
There's this every quarter end game, end game, end game, end game, changing this, adding this, this new thing, dah, dah, dah, dah.

754
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And again, I'm, I'm not trying to ask like question, like put a gun to their head or whatever, but I wanted to, I don't know if it would be rude to draw an analogy to that and be like, we just saw last epochs update.

755
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And it looks like there's a tidal wave of many end game updates coming in their future roadmap.

756
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And it, it looks good.

757
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I mean, that's, that makes me happy as a player because like they talked about in your interview, there's a huge difference between what's fun to do one time and what's fun to do repeated times.

758
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Hmm.

759
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And a lot of people rip through the campaign and do a couple of echoes.

760
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's like, okay, then what?

761
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I think these constant updates to end game are going to, are going to do well over there.

762
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And I want to ask them, is there ever going to be a roadmap for Diablo four that looks like that end game, end game, end game, every single time end game, end game, end game.

763
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But yeah, one of my questions would have been, do you guys plan to do a roadmap?

764
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah.

765
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Give it to me straight because let's be honest.

766
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Let's be honest.

767
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You're the, you're the voice of reason.

768
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You're the sweet little angel.

769
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Everyone loves you.

770
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And I'm like, you know, like on the shoulders and I'm like the devil with the pitchfork.

771
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Is it, is it very rude if I ask a question like that?

772
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Okay.

773
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So I don't know.

774
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
My mic might've cut up there for a moment, but I, I actually did want to ask if they were going to do a roadmap.

775
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Um, I don't think they will.

776
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And I think the reason is they don't want to pigeonhole themselves.

777
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
They might've even touched upon this in the past.

778
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I think I anticipate the answer to be that if they're not going to do a roadmap, it's because they don't want to, uh, pigeonhole themselves into a specific path.

779
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And then if something else comes up, right.

780
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And some other fire they have to put out, they got to rearrange the roadmap.

781
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And now they're going to piss people off because they have to push things off.

782
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I think that will be the reason they would not want to do a roadmap, but I still, it was a question I did want to ask.

783
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I don't think it necessitates, uh, you know, framing in the context of another game.

784
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
If you want to, you could.

785
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Um, but odds are they probably haven't seen that video either.

786
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Um, but I mean, roadmaps in general, I think is, is totally fair play to ask.

787
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Okay.

788
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm going to ask it maybe in a, in a quote unquote softer, softer way.

789
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Um, okay.

790
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
What else?

791
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
What, what other pressing topics are we missing?

792
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I mean, I have four pages here.

793
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I don't think, uh, this is ever going to happen, but, um,

794
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I, for sure.

795
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I forgot if I managed to ask this, but I want to ask whether the, the scope and size of, uh, seasons we've seen in two and three is about what we can expect going forward.

796
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Uh, also whether the vision for what seasons are has changed since launch.

797
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Okay.

798
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Uh, without being able to find the question specifically.

799
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Uh, so I'm going to kind of ramble here, the question, but basically we've seen in the past couple of seasons, uh, there's the season launch.

800
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Uh, there's the season launch.

801
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And then there's like maybe one or two things that happened during the season.

802
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's either like, uh, the abattoir of zeer or, uh, like a mid summer or sorry, mid whatever mid winter event.

803
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Or there's like a couple points that happened throughout a season that I guess is intended to bring people back.

804
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Uh, just I'm wondering like, what is their intended cadence of, I guess, content rollout?

805
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Like, is it again, is what we have seen sort of what we can expect going forward?

806
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Or do they plan on having more content beats throughout a season or fewer, uh, kind of what they're thinking there.

807
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Actually, I want to know what your thought is.

808
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
What, what do you want to see in a season?

809
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Do you like everything happens on day one and then nothing changes for the rest of the season?

810
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Or do you like to see some other little content drop, you know, two weeks in a month in, or what would you like as someone who, you know, plays these games a lot?

811
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Uh, well, I, but let me tell you something, CJ, that happens to me a lot.

812
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I don't know if this happens to you, but one thing that I get spammed all the time on the internet is.

813
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Rax's opinion doesn't reflect the community's opinion because he plays the game all day.

814
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So Rax doesn't speak for us and whatever he says can be taken with a grain of salt and is not going to help the community.

815
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I hear this shit.

816
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Um, and I've on every platform, every single time.

817
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Um, so what the mid season events have been are fun, little, very low time required, very low effort cutie patootie things to get into.

818
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And get some cosmetics.

819
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That's what they have been.

820
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Um, and I think that the majority of the people that play casually, which is, I understand is 95% of the people that play the game.

821
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Um, probably really like that.

822
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And that event probably kind of aligns with what they're looking for.

823
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So does, does a mid season event need to change from their perspective?

824
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Maybe not.

825
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:03,000
The, the thing for me about what has not drawn me to them is the events and mostly the rewards have not seemed very great.

826
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Like for example, if, if I got to, if I did the, the, the winter event and I'd let me transmog as a snowman, like I'm actually a snowman on my horse.

827
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I would have done that because I mean, I can be a snowman, but what they currently have doesn't entice me to log in and complete the event.

828
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
For me personally, and it's not because I just play in them.

829
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
People say, Oh, well, it's because racks plays them.

830
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I like events that are timed and have some kind of a little competition to them.

831
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It doesn't even have to take a lot of skill.

832
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Um, it could be, Oh, I don't know who finds the most, the most, the most, uh, Rudolph, the red nose reindeer things in the snow for the, for the event.

833
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And you win a prize and maybe there's a cap on how many noses you can find per day.

834
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So that way the casuals don't miss out, but I love what POE does.

835
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Like POE takes their game, gives you a completely different version of the game and has a little bit of a race to it, bro.

836
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm never going to win those events ever.

837
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm never going to win any prizes.

838
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And I think that that's way more fun than the season events that Diablo four is doing.

839
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So that's a complicated answer in that what they're doing right now is probably fine for the masses.

840
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But if you want my answer, I haven't been enticed to play them at all for those reasons.

841
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
How do you feel about it?

842
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Um, yeah. So, I mean, I guess if we're speaking about what, what things we have gotten, I would say for the most part, they're, they're okay.

843
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Like the, I don't love the season events. I don't hate them.

844
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Like it's something to do. It doesn't take particularly long. It's not exactly thrilling.

845
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
It comes in at a point in the season where we're pretty much already kind of done.

846
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And it's just sort of maybe giving us a couple more hours of play time.

847
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Um, on top of that. So we, we've had that, and we've also had Avatar of Zeer that also released later in the season.

848
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
That was in season two, season three, we had the gauntlet come in later on.

849
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Uh, in both those cases, that was content also not for me.

850
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So it's not something that I engaged in for, for very long either.

851
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Um, I do, I do like that there is stuff to come back for.

852
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Um, but I think I'm like you in that I, I would like it to be something that I guess I personally would be more invested in.

853
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So what, what would make you more invested in them?

854
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
That's a great question. And I think, I don't know how familiar you are with Helldivers.

855
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And I know anytime I bring this up, people are like, it's an entirely different game.

856
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It's an entirely different genre. Okay, sure.

857
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But to me, it is like the perfect example of live service done perfectly.

858
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Because it's a game that cannot exist without it being a live service.

859
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It justifies in every way it being a live service.

860
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Their content rolls.

861
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And I'm, so I'm not saying that this is what they should do in, in ARPGs, but just to frame what they do in Helldivers too.

862
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
They have a patch.

863
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Uh, they have a patch once a week.

864
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Uh, with, um, generally there's, there's new content that rolls out on a pretty regular basis.

865
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Um, and they have stuff in their patch notes, but they also have stuff that's not in the patch notes.

866
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
And that tends to be like, like balance changes towards their weapons and stuff.

867
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's definitely in the patch notes, but then new enemies popping up that just sort of people discover it while they're playing the game.

868
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And they sort of like have little teasers going up to it like a week before, like, oh, on this planet, I saw a mech and I could get in the mech guys.

869
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I'm actually driving a mech. What the hell? They added mechs in the game.

870
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And then like two weeks later, they give us this major mission to actually unlock the mechs for everyone.

871
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So they sort of tease it in the game. First, people are like discovering stuff in the game and say, oh, what's this cool stuff?

872
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And so the game is changing and evolving over time. And it's not all just like one patch where they say this is everything that's coming.

873
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And now there's nothing left to get excited about and discover. So for me, I've been loving Helldivers.

874
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Like I don't really play games outside of stream and I've been playing a ton of Helldivers with my friends and having a blast.

875
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
So I don't know. I really like the way Helldivers is doing things.

876
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I wonder if there's any way to integrate that kind of stuff or something of that into an ARPG.

877
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So you like the main thing for you is the element of surprise and discovery.

878
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:31,000
You don't quite know what you're getting into. And you have a feeling that when you're playing, you might uncover, you know, a little diamond in the rough kind of thing.

879
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah, that's definitely a part of it. And I think in the ARPG sense, we don't want to be changing builds because in an ARPG, you are investing heavily into creating your build.

880
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So it's not like, oh, this new weapon. And now I need to like redo all my character or whatever.

881
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But like if it's content that we're doing, like a dungeon or an enemy type or a raid or, you know, whatever.

882
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Sorry, raid is not the word. You know, some kind of boss or an Uber, like new things to engage with as opposed to things that are changing our build.

883
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Right. Like we want to stick with the same build that we're building up because we're investing time into it.

884
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
If the game, you know, if we're getting a balance change every week, then it's like, well, why am I even bothering to grind up all this gear?

885
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's going to get nerfed next week. But I do think there's places, especially with this big open world of Diablo 4, justify the open world.

886
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Make things happen that attract us to different places to go there, you know, check out whatever dungeon that is or whatever pit runner. I don't know.

887
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah, the I'm trying to think of analogies in Diablo 4. I have been surprised a few times. I didn't know. I remember in the vampire theme, I didn't know how the ambushes that the ambushes were going to happen. I almost died.

888
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah, that was cool. And I was testing on the PTR and I ran into a goblin pack. They didn't put that in the patch notes. I don't think. Oh yeah.

889
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So that so that but those are probably kind of like maybe too small in scope for what you're talking about. You're looking for something a little bit bigger than that. But I mean, as someone who degenerately blasts the game, you definitely you definitely notice those things.

890
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I'm surprised they didn't put other kinds of goblins in the game. Maybe that's another thing I could ask them about.

891
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Um, I'd imagine maybe over time that something we'll, we'll do. Yeah. You want to know another thing that I really enjoy in games? It's in, it's in like all the different games. It's in POE. It's in Elden ring. It's, it's in Diablo 3.

892
00:50:33,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I forget when you're playing the game and there's a, like a very rare chance or like a secret that opens a portal somewhere entirely different. And it asks you the question, do, would you like to go in here instead and see what's in here? And when it's like, you know, it's challenging or it's rewarding, then it can be really fun. Like when the vault spawns or the POE side areas, when I went through the campaign as a beginner, you know, you see the side area, you really want to go do it.

893
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It looks fun. You know, you find out later, oh, you just skip everything and just run through it. But the idea of it is there. Elden ring, you open a chest and it teleports you to an end game zone. And there's like a big dragon in front of you. It's like, ah, should I really go fight him? Probably not. But if I kill him, he might drop me like his tooth or something. And then I can kill everybody. Um, I wonder if that would be another kind of thing that you're describing. Can you give a, like, imagine we're running nightmare, you're running nightmare dungeons in season four. And on your 40th one, it just drops a gold.

894
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Portal. And it just says leads to a place that does not exist. It doesn't have to be the cow level, but anything. And you'd be like, holy shit, what is this? I have never seen this. Okay, let's go in. Let's, let's see what we have here.

895
00:51:42,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I think that'd be absolutely amazing. And I guess so question for you and for, you know, chat as well, because I know some people they want everything to be launching at the start of the season. But what if that happened like a month in like no, no announcement from Blizzard, but one month in to the new season, racks is playing and suddenly a portal opens and no one knows what the hell this is. Everyone is seeing this for the first time on racks is stream. And he goes in and it takes him to the cow level, for instance, or whatever, something else.

896
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And now all of a sudden people are like, well, there's this new level and people are going to start logging people who like they were done with the season. Now they're going to start logging back in to try to find this, this new secret level.

897
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Oh, data miners. I didn't think of data miners.

898
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Ooh.

899
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:50,000
The thing about data, the interesting thing about data mining is, um, so there's a massive push to, you know, find the cow level and we have like, I think we've progressed as far as we can into the, into the quest or whatever.

900
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And, but the thing is, is with data mining is there is no data mine for an area called the cow level or anything with a mysterious name or mysterious mobs.

901
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Like they've looked at it very, very thoroughly and it's just not there.

902
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So it's kind of hard to, I don't, I don't know how you hide anything from the internet anymore.

903
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:22,000
They did this already with sellers.

904
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I would say yes on a very, I wouldn't say on a minor level sellers are cool, but you kind of have to, the thing about sellers is you gotta, again, uh, when I see a seller nowadays, now that I played the game for a while, I'm not dying to dive into that seller.

905
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I got bigger fish to fry the surprise that could be waiting in the seller is usually not worth the time invested to check it.

906
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It's it. That's why I don't, I don't know when you see a seller, CJ, if you're doing hell tide, if you're trying to get some boss mats, if you're leveling up your nightmare dungeons, do you get on your pony and ride over to a seller to go check it out for a surprise that might be in there?

907
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Sell lar? What, what is this?

908
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The, the little, the little random, the, I'm trolling you. Yeah, no, I, I don't, I don't care at all about sellers. Yeah.

909
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Okay.

910
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
You got me on that one. I was like, what?

911
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
What?

912
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh, yeah, no, I think that's a great point where like, if, if they are going to add these, these transformative things, they, they need to be significant enough that we would care about them. Right? Like if, if, you know, a, a month into the season, they add like a flower in a town, like it's not something that's big and exciting.

913
00:54:43,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Yeah, exactly. Okay. Um, before I let you go, are there any final things? Cause I got one thing I have to do before we start here is I have to organize these probably by order of importance. Cause I don't think I will get through like, I don't know, like any of this, but I'll try. Um, is there any other critical question that you would like to get an answer on that didn't get to yesterday that we haven't already covered?

914
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Uh, I'm going to think on that a moment longer, but I will also say, uh, I ordered my questions in order of importance and I realized I should have also kept in mind.

915
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:40,000
How long each of these questions would take to answer. Cause I had to start triaging throughout the interview and skipping some of my important ones, just cause I knew that they would be really big answers. And so I was jumping down to still important, but very shorter questions. So something just to bear in mind, I guess, as you're also, uh,

916
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:48,000
uh, asking those, um, I don't know if, I don't think I got to ask about map overlay. I know some people still care about that. It's probably going to be a shorter answer.

917
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Um, Oh, PVP again, not a super priority thing, but I did kind of want to ask, are you guys happy with where PVP is now? Uh, or do you have any plans to expand on in the future?

918
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Uh, trade you've opened up trade in season four. Any plans to give us some tools or something to increase the quality of life of trade? So don't have to go to external websites.

919
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I have a, that's my number three. I will get to that is social features, trading group finder clans. Um, and, uh, asking about, you know, trying to avoid third party sites.

920
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Beautiful.

921
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Yep. I have that. Um, so I can do like quick hits here. Um, so the quick hits I have are how do they feel about loot filter? How do they feel about PVP? How do they feel about SSF? Um, how do they feel about offline mode?

922
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:55,000
How do they feel about ladders? Uh, we can put, here's one question I wanted to ask. I mean, it's kind of low priority, but I wanted to ask them.

923
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Mike Ybarra, before he left, tweeted that Diablo five will come much faster than Diablo four. Do you think I would ever get an answer to the question of, um, have you guys already started to work on Diablo five?

924
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Or plans about what Diablo five would be? I mean, even if the answer is yes, do you think that we'll ever, do you think I'll even get a yes or a no answer out of them for that or no?

925
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:28,000
They wouldn't say whether they started to work on Diablo five. Um, they might start, they might say they've been thinking about it, which I mean, honestly, whether they've started working on it or not, like it's an easy answer to say, well, sure.

926
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:42,000
We've thought about, you know, Diablo five. Um, you might want to ask, um, like bring up the Ybarra quote specifically and ask what they think about that or what they think he meant about that might be a way to allow them to say something on the topic.

927
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm just going to delete it. Let's just get rid of it. I, I ain't got no time for any wishy-washy questions that aren't going to get, they aren't going to get an answer.

928
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Um, another thing that I saw a lot of people, uh, another thing that I saw a lot of people

929
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:12,000
ask about was the campaign. So a lot of people liked the campaign, probably like the most polished, polished experience that Diablo four delivered.

930
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And the campaign is one and done. Now people don't, there's some people despise the thought of doing the campaign again.

931
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Especially like the escort quest with the camel or whatever that that was pretty brutal.

932
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:36,000
But I wonder if Diablo four could be a game where you could actually choose and it would be a legitimate choice where you could benchmark.

933
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Okay. What is leveling up in hell tide in the overworld look like after you spend three hours doing it, you are essentially at this level with this kind of gear.

934
00:58:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And then you time a campaign run for three hours and you, you expedite, you know, the, the camel quest or whatever, make it, you know, get rid of a lot of the stuff that no one wants to do a second time.

935
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:16,000
But for the most part, just keep the whole campaign intact. And then after you get done with that, you're at about the same spot and let people choose. Do you want to do the campaign or do you want to do the overworld? Cause right now, if you do the campaign, you're just a million years behind.

936
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:26,000
That's actually a really clever way of, um, of doing it. Cause yeah, my first thought upon hearing like the campaign is exactly what you said. I'm like, Oh God, like don't make us have to do the campaign again.

937
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:36,000
But that's actually a really clever way of, um, yeah, working it in where it's still more efficient to, you know, just slam the health heads. But for those who want to do it, you're not going to be terribly far behind.

938
00:59:36,000 --> 01:00:04,000
All right, man. Well, I appreciate you as a person. I appreciate your professionalism in the interview. I think you cracked the egg and got into actually a lot, a lot of, um, really good topics. I know a lot of people are big fans of yours. You've been doing this for a long time. So big respect, man. I'll, uh, try to do round two of this and see if we can get, uh, see if we can get some more questions answered here.

939
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Love you, Rex. Appreciate you. I look forward to your interview. Best of luck. You're going to kill it. And, uh, I'll be watching.

940
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,000
All right, man. Guys round of applause for CJ. Here we go with a round two of the interview for blizzard. Thanks, man.

941
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Take care.

942
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Okay.

943
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I need, okay. So a lot of these questions up here, I think are important. What I need your, I don't think I have my, I'm only have 16 more minutes, not even 16.

944
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Um, so I have the top questions for you. The, the, the, the, the important thing here is the order. I'm going to ask these questions first. I'm just follow up to CJ's interview. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask these questions first.

945
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Um, um, actually don't really care about this. I, I'm not gonna have time. Let me just delete it. Um, the top questions for YouTube. I'm asking the social features is way too important. I must ask it. Here's the, um,

946
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:34,000
um, this is supposed to be here. Social features is going to get asked a hundred percent. I already asked this question. I can delete it.

947
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Um, this is really not that important. Just delete it.

948
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Maybe I can put it down here. Let me organize this for a second. Give me a moment.

949
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Um, okay.

950
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Let me look at this.

951
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:03,000
This is probably lower priority. I'm going to put this lower. I don't really care about how Microsoft,

952
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I don't need this question anymore. Let's put this here and delete this.

953
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I really want to, I really want to talk about this. I really want to talk about the target audience of Diablo 4,

954
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
if they are willing to talk to me about it.

955
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I'm going to move this lower.

956
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Maybe here.

957
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Let's go, uh, let's go like that. Okay.

958
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Maybe we can go here.

959
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Maybe we can go here.

960
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
It's actually a way.

961
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I want to know when Uber Tomb Lord is coming out.

962
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Did I put the campaign somewhere else?

963
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Um,

964
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:34,000
got another question that we need to ask a map overlay. Another question that we need to ask.

965
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Is.

966
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Something about balance.

967
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Is.

968
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
This is kind of a, like a generic question.

969
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
We can keep it, but maybe I put it.

970
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Much lower.

971
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Let's cut this out.

972
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
This, I think is a very, this is a very good question.

973
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I really want, I really want to ask about, I, I must ask about this.

974
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I'm going to put it, I just, I'm going to press this out.

975
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Okay.

976
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Okay.

977
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Um.

978
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:43,000
What I'm going to do is I'm going to set a timer for 40 minutes.

979
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And then when I get to 40 minutes, I'm going to go to the quick hits and I'm going to ask all of them.

980
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Just real quick knee-jerk reaction to what do they think about these things.

981
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
So let's set it for 40 minutes.

982
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And then I'm going to ask all of them.

983
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
What time is the interview?

984
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
In 11 minutes.

985
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Okay.

986
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Okay.

987
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I think this is important.

988
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I already asked all of these, so I'm consolidating my list significantly.

989
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Social features.

990
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I need this to go here.

991
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
This needs to be tabbed over.

992
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
All right.

993
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Okay.

994
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Man, dude.

995
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Okay.

996
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:01,000
So let's look at the order here that I have and let's see if this is pretty good or not.

997
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So the first thing I want to talk to them about is pinnacle content.

998
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I'm going to ask this first.

999
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
They talked about it a lot in CJ's interview.

1000
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I want to ask them, is there ever going to be skill involved in the end game or is it all going to be about gear?

1001
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Along with that, let's ask for a roadmap.

1002
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Is there a main focus in the end game?

1003
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
That's the thing I care about probably the most.

1004
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I think I can delete this question.

1005
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I don't need to ask that.

1006
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
They always say that they deeply care about feedback.

1007
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And one super mysterious thing about Blizzard is how do you actually receive the feedback?

1008
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Do you guys have meetings about it?

1009
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Can you walk me through, like, does someone, is Adam, is Adam, God, how many Adams are there?

1010
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
There's Adam Jackson.

1011
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
There's Adam Fletcher.

1012
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
How many Adams and Joes are there?

1013
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Does he gather, is there a team that gathers it all and then you look at it and then you have a meeting about it?

1014
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I want to know how do they process feedback and how do they test things.

1015
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I want to hear from them how they do it.

1016
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
The State of Nightmare Dungeons, they made them better.

1017
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
You can teleport to them.

1018
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
You buffed Glyph XP.

1019
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
They're putting more things to do in them, like events.

1020
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
You lowered the cast time to 0.75 seconds.

1021
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And they said that, they said in CJ's interview that they want to iterate on Nightmare Dungeons.

1022
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So, I want to ask them, have they considered more qualitative ideas, not only with the current state of Nightmare Dungeons, but in the future?

1023
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
For example, can we carry multiple objects?

1024
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,000
If you have two rocks and two pedestals, if you go rock, rock, you're already guaranteed to backtrack, right?

1025
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Stuff like that.

1026
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Is there any reason why we can't reduce the cast time further?

1027
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

1028
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
It's not necessarily that I mind freeing prisoners.

1029
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It's I mind freeing seven prisoners.

1030
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Why is there seven of them?

1031
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
How about like three where I just click them and they're free?

1032
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
And then the slay all with one monster behind.

1033
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I know that there was a fix for little things to follow you, but that doesn't work all the time.

1034
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And it bricked some of our Nightmare Dungeons.

1035
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Don't get into drama questions.

1036
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Right.

1037
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I don't think any of this has any drama to it.

1038
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,000
What?

1039
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
There's no drama here.

1040
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Okay.

1041
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Okay.

1042
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Okay.

1043
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Okay.

1044
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Okay.

1045
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Okay.

1046
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There's no ghost anyone who can do this.

1047
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
But it seems to have someism in the for your business.

1048
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Okay.

1049
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,000
You don't have anyuge今日.

1050
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Okay.

1051
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I'm done.

1052
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So they're setting up and their Discord is broken.

1053
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Their Discord is broken, so we're going to do it in Zoom.

1054
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So they're going to send me a Zoom link.

1055
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
There's something wrong with Discord.

1056
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So we're going to Zoom.

1057
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Okay.

1058
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
They're not trying to back out.

1059
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
No, they're not trying to back out.

1060
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Okay.

1061
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Yeah, M3X did, Seattle.

1062
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
All right.

1063
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Okay.

1064
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Let's see how Zoom is going to go.

1065
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
All right.

1066
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Let me...

1067
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I guess we're going to join now.

1068
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Let me switch my screen real quick and see if I can join the Zoom link.

1069
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Be right back.

1070
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
All righty.

1071
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Click on this.

1072
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Open the Zoom meeting.

1073
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Here we go.

1074
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Join.

1075
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Join.

1076
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
That should work.

1077
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Let's try that.

1078
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Okay.

1079
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I'm in.

1080
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
But let me see.

1081
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I think I have to start virtual camera on OBS.

1082
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Let me start the...

1083
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
There we go.

1084
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Does that work?

1085
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
There.

1086
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Well, kind of.

1087
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I'm about to move my...

1088
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Let me move this down, maybe.

1089
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
There.

1090
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
That actually kind of worked.

1091
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Okay.

1092
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
All right.

1093
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,000
All right.

1094
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:07,000
It was a mic issue that was disable Adam Jackson's mic.

1095
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I'm flexible, man.

1096
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I am flexible.

1097
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
We do whatever.

1098
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Whatever works.

1099
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I'm big chilling over here.

1100
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Big chilling over here.

1101
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
All right.

1102
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Yeah.

1103
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I'm just sitting here.

1104
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Let's see if Adam and Joe can come in here.

1105
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
All right.

1106
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Well, while we're waiting here,

1107
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I guess there's...

1108
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I guess there's no issue in me.

1109
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Coming back here, right?

1110
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Okay.

1111
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Let me see here.

1112
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Let me get rid of this webcam, maybe.

1113
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Let me get rid of this.

1114
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,000
All right.

1115
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
What's up?

1116
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
All right.

1117
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
And I wonder if I can show...

1118
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Hey, what's going on, man?

1119
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:22,000
What is up?

1120
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
What is up?

1121
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
All right.

1122
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Can you...

1123
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,000
We're doing it.

1124
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
It's happening.

1125
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,000
It's happening.

1126
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Can you guys hear him fine?

1127
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Is he fine up or down?

1128
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
How is it sounding, guys?

1129
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Can you talk for a second, Joe?

1130
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Just testing the ups and downs.

1131
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
You know, what's up?

1132
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
How do I sound, chat?

1133
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Okay.

1134
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I can see it's way too low.

1135
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
I'm going to turn you way higher.

1136
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Let's try again.

1137
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I can just start screaming.

1138
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Hey, how do I sound right now?

1139
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Okay.

1140
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Is that better, guys?

1141
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Up more.

1142
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Up more.

1143
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Okay.

1144
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We're going...

1145
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I have you at 100.

1146
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Okay.

1147
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Oh, man.

1148
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,000
This is dangerous.

1149
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I'm going to...

1150
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
This is going to get dangerous when I get excited about something.

1151
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
So we got to watch out for that.

1152
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Apologizing in advance.

1153
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Hey, thanks so much for coming on here, man.

1154
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I'm really excited.

1155
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Yeah.

1156
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
This is going to be a blast.

1157
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I'm looking forward to the conversation.

1158
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Hell yeah.

1159
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Yeah.

1160
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Where's my partner in crime?

1161
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Where's Adam Z.

1162
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Jackson?

1163
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You want to know what?

1164
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
He's faking all of these technical issues and he's just like, you want to know what?

1165
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I'm going to call in sick and I'm just going to have Joe solo this.

1166
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Yeah, it's fine.

1167
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Let's do it.

1168
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Let's just sign him up for a whole bunch of stuff.

1169
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Okay.

1170
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
So what I'm going to do here, tried my best to be as prepared as possible.

1171
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Cool.

1172
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
But of course, I'm probably not prepared at all.

1173
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So that's just the way life goes.

1174
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,000
No, no, no.

1175
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It's all good.

1176
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Hey, and one thing up front, right off the top here is like, I have a lot of things I

1177
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
want to say, but it's okay if you want to interject.

1178
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
So it's not rude.

1179
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I'm not going to take it as being rude.

1180
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So if there's the things you want to chat through or things you want clarification on,

1181
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
please interrupt me.

1182
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,000
It's all good.

1183
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I feel like I want to give that preface to everybody I talk to now on stream, right?

1184
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I would never interrupt that sweet, angelic, mellow fluous voice.

1185
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Speaking of that, Adam Jackson is here.

1186
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Let's take four questions.

1187
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Can people hear me okay?

1188
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I've spent the last 45 minutes troubleshooting my mic and it's been the worst.

1189
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It's okay?

1190
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Okay.

1191
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Dude, is that a paper towel roller by your bed?

1192
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
How do I get one of those?

1193
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I have kids.

1194
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
They're very messy.

1195
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It's part of the life.

1196
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Dude, that is, that's the most ingenious thing I've ever seen.

1197
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
We're pretty creative over here.

1198
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
You can hear me okay though.

1199
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I'm very concerned about this.

1200
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,000
It's fine.

1201
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Okay.

1202
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Thank God.

1203
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I mean, I can hear you.

1204
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Chat, can you hear them?

1205
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Sounds perfect for me.

1206
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
How is it for you guys?

1207
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
All right, cool.

1208
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Because I changed, I fucked with all my computer settings and now everything's terrible.

1209
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
But as long as it works, I'm happy.

1210
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,000
All right.

1211
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
All right.

1212
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Okay.

1213
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
I'm starting a 40 minute timer.

1214
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Then we'll do rapid fire at the end to try to hit as many as possible.

1215
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,000
That sounds good.

1216
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Sounds good to me.

1217
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Thank you so much for being here, guys.

1218
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,000
All right.

1219
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Yesterday, CJ Riker did an interview with them.

1220
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So he asked a bunch of great questions.

1221
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I want to do some follow-ups to some of the questions that you guys talked about.

1222
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
So one thing, the topic that I think you guys probably covered the most in the interview

1223
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
yesterday at different parts was about aspirational and pinnacle content.

1224
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Some of the things that you said that was uber Lilith at the start of the Diablo 4 was

1225
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
all mechanical mastery.

1226
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
If you don't dodge the waves, you're dead.

1227
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
There's pretty much nothing you can do about that.

1228
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And a lot of players didn't have fun just, you know, getting crushed by her waves.

1229
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Talked about there's different lovers to pull on the difficulty.

1230
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
You can make players weaker like Nightmare Dungeon Sigils.

1231
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,000
You can make monsters hit harder.

1232
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
You can give them more health, more crowd control.

1233
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And I heard you say that the decisions that you make before you go into the encounter should

1234
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
matter more because it's an ARPG.

1235
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
It's about hunting loot.

1236
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
It's about getting powerful.

1237
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And then you go in and you have a big advantage and you finally overcome the difficulty.

1238
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And another thing that I heard you guys say is when you guys introduce very difficult

1239
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,000
events like the Avatar of Zier, for example, when you properly advertise it as something that's

1240
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
very difficult, you didn't get any negative backlash or too much negative backlash for

1241
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
the difficulty of it because it was properly labeled.

1242
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:35,000
So with that huge preface in mind, my question is, is do you guys have plans in the future

1243
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:43,000
of Diablo 4 to build in these very, very difficult encounters that do require skill, that do require

1244
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
you to go in with an event or with a boss, learn their mechanics, and that is going to be

1245
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
another supplement besides getting gear to winning.

1246
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Thoughts on that?

1247
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Yeah, sure.

1248
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
So I can just kind of, I'll start off.

1249
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So yeah, everything we talked about yesterday, you just did a good job of covering again.

1250
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I appreciate that.

1251
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
But when we think about what the future of aspirational content needs to look like in

1252
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
the game, we do want to leave opportunities for this kind of mechanically complex content

1253
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
for players to engage with.

1254
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And we experiment with it a few different ways.

1255
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,000
So I don't think that, like the Echo Lulith encounter, it's a really good example of

1256
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
like, you know, us like diving really, really hard into mechanical mastery where we expect

1257
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
players to really have to be very, very active in terms of their dodges in order to survive.

1258
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
But we do want to continue to experiment with these ideas and try more things, particularly

1259
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
when they are advertised in the appropriate place.

1260
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Adam, do you have thoughts on this?

1261
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Yeah, originally I did.

1262
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And it was like a very long winded answer.

1263
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
But I don't want to take up too much time on this.

1264
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I guess what I'll say is, you know, everything kind of exists on a spectrum when we're talking

1265
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
about things like difficulty or a lot of game design topics and ideas.

1266
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Because like in this spectrum, in my mind, it's like, you know, how hard should the fame

1267
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
be versus how much should your gear going into it matter, right?

1268
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I think we're still trying to find out what the best answer is for the things that are

1269
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
really, really hard, like Uber Lilith or these crazy, difficult fights.

1270
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
One of the things that we're doing in season four that we started doing in Beyond that one

1271
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
of our encounter designers came up with a great idea was adding this.

1272
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I think you've probably seen our array racks, but that second debuff idea where, you know,

1273
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
you can screw up getting hit by a wave a couple of times, but then after that, you're

1274
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
probably just going to get one shot and die.

1275
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And so that gives us this kind of happy medium between pure one shot mechanics and things

1276
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,000
where you have to be perfect in your dexterity versus, you know, the other way where you

1277
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
can just like outgear everything.

1278
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
There's some other things that can go into of like, you know, the difference of the most

1279
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
powerful and least power or mid powerful builds and how we do difficulty.

1280
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Maybe we'll give that a different answer, but that's the TLDR.

1281
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I think we're still trying to figure out what is best for our game and what our players

1282
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
like.

1283
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
You know, in my heart of hearts, I'm more like you racks.

1284
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I love the very, very crazy hard things.

1285
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I don't mind one shots personally in my games, but I don't think it's best for this game.

1286
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yeah.

1287
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
It's not millennia.

1288
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
We have play it.

1289
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Yeah.

1290
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I don't think that it's best long term, but having a little bit of that kind of stuff

1291
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
sometimes I think is okay.

1292
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I think it's more how much and how we introduce it and how we frame it to people.

1293
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
That's the simple answer.

1294
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Okay.

1295
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So kind of like one thing that you guys are liking is kind of like the soft enrages where

1296
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
over time, eventually it gets to get so difficult that you're eventually going to lose.

1297
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yeah.

1298
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yeah.

1299
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Fancy 14 does a good job with this as well.

1300
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Like they have this idea, like, you know, if you mess up a mechanic, you're going to

1301
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
get stacking deep off and it can escalate and get worse and worse as the fight goes

1302
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,000
on.

1303
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
It's an interesting way to allow for some mistakes or current for some learning to happen,

1304
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
but really like, and to punish you, but not immediately spike you and end the encounter.

1305
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Awesome.

1306
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Awesome.

1307
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So one thing that see some other games doing is they release roadmaps of kind of like in

1308
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
the same topic of end game of things that, Kali, stop it.

1309
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Sit down.

1310
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Sorry about that.

1311
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Um, so for Diablo four, will we ever see roadmaps come out kind of showing like detailing what

1312
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
might be coming in the next six months to a year?

1313
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I know that there's some challenges with that.

1314
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Like if you guys change your mind, then like the community gets really mad at you.

1315
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
What are your thoughts on that?

1316
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I think it's important that community knows that we are identifying problems, you know,

1317
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and that we, we are listening as I've said before.

1318
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And I think that a roadmap does a good job of like expressing some of this information,

1319
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
but it does, to your point, does lock us into a schedule.

1320
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So I think that we're, we're kind of like thinking about how we want to approach, like

1321
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
explaining these sorts of things.

1322
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Like you'll recall back in like season two, I mentioned at the very end of, of actually

1323
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
between when we were wrapping up season two and AOZ was out and we were getting ready to

1324
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
begin talking about season three, I mentioned that we had identified a lot of itemization

1325
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
issues and things that we wanted to make like upgrades to and make updates, which turned

1326
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
into the season of Loot Reborn and season four.

1327
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Now I want to make it clear that we identified a lot of the issues that the players have been

1328
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
talking to us about for a while, but we weren't able to like immediately resolve those sorts

1329
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,000
of things.

1330
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,000
So I don't want, one thing I, when I, I occasionally see from players when they see a long roadmap is

1331
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
they'll see something that they care deeply about it, like really, really towards the end

1332
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
of a year and they'll ask them like, well, do they not think this is important?

1333
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Do they not care about this?

1334
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
And I, I think that there's a way for us to talk about these things that players feel

1335
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that they, they, they, that they have confidence, like that we are looking at these problems

1336
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
and we do have plans.

1337
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
So I think we're just working through exactly the way that we want to approach this.

1338
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Yeah, I think I'll chime in a little bit.

1339
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
One of the things that you're going to hear is a constant theme from me and other designers

1340
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
say this with different words, but there's this idea that there's, there's rarely really

1341
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
perfect solutions.

1342
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
There's really only trade-offs in the world.

1343
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
And this actually comes from an economic term that says that there's never solutions, only

1344
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:54,000
trade-offs.

1345
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
But, you know, when you ask us things like, you know, why don't you do X or Y, or why

1346
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
don't you provide roadmaps?

1347
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
The way that our brains immediately go is, well, there's pros and cons and which decision

1348
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
is best trying to get the most pros that we can with the least cons that we can, right?

1349
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
It's a simple example of roadmaps is the pro of roadmap is everybody's on the

1350
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
same page.

1351
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
We show that, hey, we care about these things and the community knows what to expect, right?

1352
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Obviously, that is a desirable thing to do.

1353
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
But there's big cons that maybe we have that you don't see.

1354
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And this is where most design discussions end up of people asking us, well, what do you

1355
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,000
think as developers?

1356
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Is that we try to explain the cons to you so that you understand the full picture.

1357
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
You know, the cons of a roadmap is we're locked in now.

1358
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
We've promised things to you that we may not be able to do for whatever reason when things

1359
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
end up changing down the road, right?

1360
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Life has a way of screwing with your plans, especially when you try to plan things more

1361
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
long term.

1362
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
This isn't just true with game design, but anything.

1363
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
So we try to make promises and keep promises.

1364
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Like one of my things I'm really passionate about as a designer is when it comes to interacting

1365
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
with the community, making promises and then keeping them.

1366
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So I'm extremely careful of the promises.

1367
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I mean, this is just my strategy of how to build trust with people and the community and

1368
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
just life in general is I'm very careful of what promises I make.

1369
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And then I make damn sure when I do that I keep them.

1370
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And so to do that, the longer our roadmap goes out, the higher chance we're not going to

1371
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
keep those promises.

1372
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Some things, for example, that we've seeded in the past.

1373
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I remember it was either our season one or season two campfire chat.

1374
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I made a list of things that our team wants to do longer term.

1375
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
One of those things on those lists was making scaling mechanics for legendaries that kind

1376
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,000
of suck.

1377
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And we finally were doing that in season four, right?

1378
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
You know, your earthquake legendaries, all of those.

1379
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
We finally made them scale with your weapon to make the damage go up.

1380
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I also talked about at the time, and we haven't delivered on this yet, in my opinion, but making

1381
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
ultimates meaningful and scale in a similar way.

1382
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
It's on our radar.

1383
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's something I want to do.

1384
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Haven't done it yet.

1385
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I didn't give a date because I don't know when the date is because our timelines and

1386
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
schedules and priorities change quite a bit based on community feedback.

1387
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
You know, if I had made the promise like, hey, we're definitely fixing ultimates, then

1388
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Loot Reborn wouldn't have happened because I have to spend my team's time on doing that

1389
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,000
other thing.

1390
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
But this other thing came up that I think is way more important for the game.

1391
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
And that's just kind of how the nature of our job goes.

1392
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Thank you for the super detailed answer.

1393
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
And that is a perfect segue into my next question.

1394
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,000
It's kind of like an addition of Mythbusters, kind of.

1395
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So a lot of people in the community, a lot of the people that are angry in the community

1396
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
about, you know, whatever it is they're angry about at the time, they say that they're passionate

1397
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
about something.

1398
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Passionate.

1399
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Very passionate.

1400
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
That's the word we're looking for.

1401
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Constructively passionate.

1402
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Yeah.

1403
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Yeah.

1404
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Constructively passionate.

1405
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
So one thing that I they have, like the meme video of you guys saying feedback, feedback,

1406
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:41,000
feedback.

1407
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And then on the Internet from a bunch of different angles, they say Blizzard doesn't listen to

1408
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:46,000
feedback.

1409
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
They don't do anything.

1410
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
They don't even test their game where their beta testers.

1411
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:58,000
So I wanted to ask you guys, could you give us some insights into how your team actually

1412
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
processes and internalizes feedback?

1413
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Is it like concatenated for you and you guys have a meeting and you discuss it like that?

1414
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:13,000
How do you guys go about testing things internally to kind of debunk all of these myths that you

1415
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
guys are just working by yourselves and never listening to anything?

1416
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
We know it's not true.

1417
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
You want to go first, Joe?

1418
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Yeah, I think we both probably have different things you want to say about this.

1419
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:32,000
So I think that the point on feedback, I think that's being brought up, there's like kind of two

1420
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,000
things.

1421
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Like one, are the designers in a corner entirely by themselves, like just making decisions with

1422
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
no information being good to them?

1423
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And the other version is like, is the team listening to the community?

1424
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Right.

1425
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And then how do we process these sorts of things?

1426
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Right.

1427
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:51,000
So the starting from the does the team listen to the community like side of this thing,

1428
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,000
you know, we are always reading everything on that's getting posted on Reddit.

1429
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
We're getting everything that's posted on the forums.

1430
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
We're going through our socials on a regular basis.

1431
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
We have teams and people like like Adam Fletcher, you know, the community director,

1432
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
he's going through and like kind of gathering a lot of this information for us.

1433
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And in places where we don't like I personally can't read every thread in every social media

1434
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,000
site.

1435
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
You can't?

1436
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I can't because there's other things I also do as part of my job.

1437
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But I do read a lot of stuff.

1438
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Right.

1439
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
And a lot of things get sent to me.

1440
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
So a lot of that stuff can get like kind of pulled together for like reporting purposes

1441
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
and brought to us.

1442
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Right.

1443
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And I think that's really, really useful.

1444
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
We also have a lot of internal feedback that we get from the from the team.

1445
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Like so when we start working on something, we were able to like kind of give a presentation

1446
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
to the overall dev team to get an idea of what we're trying to do.

1447
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
We have regular play tests where like a large group of people all get a chance to kind

1448
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
of give us feedback on a regular basis.

1449
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And we can keep checking in with them as time goes on.

1450
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
So that's I think that's a starting point for these things.

1451
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
But it's it's really important to us that we are like hearing things from the community

1452
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
because that's kind of telling us like are the like are the changes that we're making

1453
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,000
right now?

1454
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Are they effective?

1455
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Like are people having a good time with these things?

1456
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Because we can look at all kinds of data to determine things.

1457
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
But like here when people talk about it is also really, really important when they have

1458
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
when players have needs that aren't met.

1459
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
You know, it's our job to find ways to kind of like bridge the gap there and make sure

1460
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
that they're being heard.

1461
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And the game is going to be more fun for them.

1462
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
But what do you want to talk about?

1463
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Yeah.

1464
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
So firstly, I would say different game companies, different teams and even different teams

1465
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
within a bigger team have different cultures and ideas and ways that they process feedback.

1466
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:29,000
So I'll tell you what I do on my team and kind of what D4 kind of does as a larger team.

1467
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Right.

1468
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So on the live team, we are probably the most interactive with feedback because we're doing

1469
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
the live changes.

1470
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
We have to be very connected to the game to make good decisions.

1471
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:45,000
So I give this speech a lot to the people on in my group of your job as a designer is

1472
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
to go and find the problems with the game.

1473
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
And then you are the filter when the community comes in and brings up things, whether it's

1474
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
a streamer giving things.

1475
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I post things all the time from streamers.

1476
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I post things all the time from Reddit threads.

1477
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I post things all the time from our forums.

1478
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And anywhere that you can go out and go.

1479
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And also personal play experience.

1480
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Nothing replaces that as well.

1481
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So we actually dedicate every day at least some amount of time that everybody in my group

1482
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
is either playing an internal build of future things coming out in the game, which I'm playing

1483
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
through season five right now and I'm really far in it.

1484
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Or they're playing their live character in the live game because you need to understand

1485
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
the game and understand the problems.

1486
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
And the way that I do things and what I've been trying to tell my team and I think we're

1487
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,000
pretty good at is while you are parsing all this feedback and playing the game yourself,

1488
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
you keep a running list of notes of crap that sucks that you want to make better or ideas

1489
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
that other people had that you think are good ideas that you want to make better.

1490
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Now, of course, not every idea is equal, right?

1491
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
You don't copy every Reddit thread and every single thing that someone says.

1492
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
We are the filter of trying to figure out.

1493
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Remember, I talked about those no perfect solutions, only trade-offs.

1494
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
This is where we're like, hey, they brought up an idea and we think it's good.

1495
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Now we need to explore if that can actually work in the game.

1496
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And this is where we come up with our list of things and priorities that we're going

1497
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
to do.

1498
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
That's a starting point.

1499
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
That's one of a few starting points.

1500
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
The first starting point is community feedback, our own play experience.

1501
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Another one is telemetry.

1502
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
That's just a fancy word for data.

1503
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
We have the ability to see data all over the game of how many people are equipping different

1504
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
legendary aspects, how many people are engaging with certain types of content.

1505
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
We can see what's working, what's not working, what people are actually doing versus what

1506
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
they say.

1507
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Usually what they say will match with what people are doing, but there's a mismatch.

1508
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Then we have to have a discussion of like, hey, how important is this actually?

1509
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
And then another way is internal testing tools.

1510
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Again, we have groups that give us presentations and people who their job is to look through

1511
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:42,000
data and do focus sessions and all kinds of other fancy tricks to come up with stories

1512
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and understanding the different types of players we have and what they're doing and how they

1513
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:46,000
work.

1514
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
And they give us presentations on different topics that we're interested in, or they

1515
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
find their own topics of things that maybe we didn't think of that we may have missed.

1516
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And then last but not least, we have internal people.

1517
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
You know, we have a big team of people working on this game and we have certain feedback avenues

1518
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
via emails or channels that we give feedback to each other because on new stuff, we can't

1519
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
rely on telemetry or the community or all those other things.

1520
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And that's where things are a lot harder.

1521
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I think Joe went into this yesterday a little more deeper, so I'll just gloss over it.

1522
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
But this idea that Diablo is a freaking huge game that takes forever to play and really

1523
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
truly understand because our systems are so interconnected.

1524
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
So there is no substitute for actually going through that 80 plus hour experience and playing

1525
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:28,000
everything.

1526
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
The part that makes that really hard and where I think the community gives us a hard time

1527
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
sometimes, I think a little bit of it is warranted, but it's a cursed problem is what I call

1528
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
it, which is another concept I'll go into later.

1529
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Is that to really test our game, you need to spend your life playing our game in many

1530
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,000
ways or a lot of time, more times, more hours than what you normally would expect someone

1531
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
to work at a job, right?

1532
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
So we can't tell people, hey, you must spend all your life playing this game, but also,

1533
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
by the way, you have to design and create the new things too, right?

1534
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So that means that internally, it is really hard to play test the full amount of our game

1535
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:02,000
as a designer.

1536
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
We have to rely on, we have people in QA and other play testers that do play this content.

1537
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
We either direct them of things we want to test and play, or they just find things on

1538
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
their own that they think, hey, they bring it up to us, like, hey, we think this is a

1539
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
problem and we have to parse that.

1540
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
But there isn't enough time for a single designer or every designer to play the game fully all

1541
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
the time, but we do still play it a good amount and we use those internal feedback mechanisms

1542
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
to make things the best that they can.

1543
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
And this is where I think there is that little disconnect sometimes with the community where,

1544
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
yeah, we would love to polish things and play it.

1545
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Now, I would love to play season five 200 hours before it comes out.

1546
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I only get it for, you know, 50 hours, right?

1547
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:42,000
And we have to use our guts and existing ideas and telemetry to figure out if the decisions

1548
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,000
we make are right.

1549
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,000
And then we use, after we launch the game, to really fine tune and make it perfect, right?

1550
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
And that's kind of the overall process of how things work.

1551
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Yeah.

1552
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
One last thing I want to add here too, is that even when we're just thinking about like

1553
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
a feature, like we're talking about adding one thing, like something like the pit,

1554
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
for example.

1555
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Good example, because it's going to be new coming out in season four.

1556
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,000
If you sit down, you play the pit for an hour, one day, you're going to feel a certain way

1557
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
about your experience playing the pit.

1558
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
You're going to feel differently if you play that for two hours a day, five days straight,

1559
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
you know, and you experience it through that entire process.

1560
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
You're going to have a different relationship with the content at that point.

1561
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And players are going to go, you know, 10, 20 X that number by the time they're done

1562
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
playing in season potentially.

1563
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
So like, it's really, really important that we get the reps in on these features to make

1564
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
sure that they're, they're really resonating and they're singing, they're doing everything

1565
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:24,000
they need to do.

1566
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Right.

1567
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
So I think if there's a, there's a lot of truth, everything that Adam's talking about, everything is a lot

1568
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
of trade-offs, there's a lot of things we need to do.

1569
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And this, this kind of links to the PTR, the PTR feedback for season four was hugely valuable

1570
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
because now suddenly we're able to like, take, take what we already know about the season

1571
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,000
and then multiply that like 10, 20, 50 fold as we get tons of players going in, checking

1572
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
things out, not just from the telemetry, but also just in the feedback we're getting

1573
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
from content creators, from players themselves.

1574
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Like we've got a lot of really good data for that.

1575
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
So it's been, it's been very useful for the same reasons that Adam talks about.

1576
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Yeah.

1577
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I mean, go ahead.

1578
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Sorry.

1579
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:57,000
No, go ahead.

1580
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:02,000
One last real quick thing is this is where you get things that seem obvious to players

1581
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,000
that were bad ideas, but sounded like really good ideas when we're sitting in a room talking

1582
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,000
about it.

1583
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:13,000
That simple example I'll give in season four is when you temper your items or things and

1584
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
there's like a really nice thing that plays and you can see it, it's visual, but you can't

1585
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
skip it easily.

1586
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Right.

1587
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
That kind of stuff is where sometimes things fall through the cracks of, hey, doing this

1588
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
2000 times is actually terrible because you've got to wait forever versus, well, we want

1589
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
to have a moment of celebration and for the cool thing to be cool.

1590
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Balancing these things is what can be harder to do internally.

1591
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
We're obviously we've messed up enough times and this is true for every game company, so

1592
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
I'm not afraid to admit it.

1593
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
But like, you know, we've made that mistake enough times that we're now we're very cognizant

1594
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
of it.

1595
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Like we make a new feature or a new activity.

1596
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Like, hey, how does this feel if you're doing it for 200 hours?

1597
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Is this still going to be something that people want to go through?

1598
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Right.

1599
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
That's a question now that we ask all the time.

1600
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
But even then, there are times where we have to kill otherwise good ideas or we have to

1601
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
flex a little bit because we do need some presentation or some tutorialization or some

1602
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,000
other thing to balance that, even if it makes the 2000 times experience a little bit worse.

1603
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Right.

1604
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
The answer is not always so obvious, I guess.

1605
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
But we are receptive to like when the community tells us clearly, hey, no, we want it to be this

1606
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:14,000
way.

1607
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
We're going to do it that way.

1608
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
I mean, it was a lot of great points.

1609
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I mean, the I'm very glad that I asked that question because the thing that is refreshing

1610
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:31,000
to me, the thing that I wanted to hear more than anything is that you guys have a chance

1611
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
to actually play through the game and not only to hear that you guys play the game as almost

1612
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,000
part of the job description, but it sounds like you actually put a big effort into that.

1613
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
That I mean, that makes me feel that makes me feel great.

1614
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Honestly, that's that's so great to hear.

1615
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I'm so glad that's part of the process.

1616
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Talking about some of the current modes in the game.

1617
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Let's talk about you talked about yesterday, the state of nightmare dungeon.

1618
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
CJ did a ton of iteration on it.

1619
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Now we can teleport to them.

1620
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
You just buffed glyph XP.

1621
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
You said that you'd like to add more fun things to do to them in the future.

1622
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
You guys made events better.

1623
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Now I saw goblin packs, I think on the PTR when you put the vampire ambushes.

1624
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:13,000
That was good.

1625
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
You reduce the cast time down to 0.75 seconds.

1626
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
So we're going to have new things coming out for it.

1627
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,000
My question is, is going forward, it looks like you guys made a ton of qualitative changes

1628
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
to it.

1629
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Like you just make it a little bit easier to access all of these different things rather

1630
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
than riding around on your pony to every single thing and everything takes forever.

1631
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:41,000
When you are designing future things, is that kind of at the front of your mind with things

1632
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
like, oh, maybe at nightmare dungeons we can carry multiple objects?

1633
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Because if there's two rocks and two pedestals, if you go rock, rock, you're guaranteed to

1634
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:50,000
backtrack.

1635
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I mean, I have two hands.

1636
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
And then have you thought about reducing the cast time even further?

1637
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I know that one comment was if the cast time is so low, then people may not even see that

1638
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,000
they interacted with something, but maybe that could be updated via like a little quest

1639
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:06,000
thing.

1640
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Oh, quest, pick up two rocks.

1641
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Oh, it highlights.

1642
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Oh, now pick up one rock.

1643
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:17,000
And another part of it was, it's not just that I have a problem freeing prisoners.

1644
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I have a problem going to Dead Man's Dredge and the quest objective is I have to free seven

1645
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:24,000
prisoners.

1646
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Like how many people got caught here?

1647
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Is qualitative stuff still at the front of your mind when you're iterating on these things

1648
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
and in the future events that you're going to make?

1649
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
So I think that there's a couple different pieces to pick apart here, right?

1650
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
So with Nightmare Dungeons, they're building upon the dungeons we had in Diablo 4, right?

1651
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And these were supposed to be these really like kind of interesting little content things

1652
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
you could find all over the world.

1653
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
They all had little bits of like environmental storytelling, objective-based storytelling, some

1654
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
side quest points to these dungeons as well.

1655
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
And we want players to feel like they're kind of, they're going on a little bit of adventure

1656
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
when they go into these.

1657
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
We didn't, we didn't initially make the content in these spaces to feel like there was like

1658
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
blast corridors, if that makes sense, right?

1659
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:13,000
So I think that as we, as we think about what different players are looking for and what,

1660
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
what we can do to improve the experience for everybody, we don't want to lose the kind

1661
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,000
of like the contextual and like fantasy underpinnings of what players are doing to go into

1662
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
these spaces.

1663
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
To your point, like, you know, it's not that you hate freeing prisoners.

1664
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
No, but you don't like that it might take, you know, 0.75 seconds to do it is one question

1665
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:31,000
maybe.

1666
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
And then there's another one where it's like, well, you don't want to free seven.

1667
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
So you kind of want it to be like a faster, more punchy experience, but it's not that

1668
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
you don't like having to click those objects as part of your experience going through a

1669
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
dungeon.

1670
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I think that like there's, I think there's an expectation when players are like doing some

1671
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
of these actions that there is a response.

1672
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,000
So having just a, like a quest tick for some things, I'm not saying that this is where

1673
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
we would only ever make this decision and a quest tick for things like freeing a prisoner.

1674
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
It is, it is feedback.

1675
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Is it as impactful as having the moment where you get to see your character on bind that

1676
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
on the binds?

1677
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I'm not so sure, you know, but in the end is that value, it's to Adam's point earlier

1678
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
about like, you know, it's about making trade-offs.

1679
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Is the, is the idea for the player who does care, does care about like kind of going slowly

1680
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
through the space and trying to find the collectibles and trying to do all these things for that

1681
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:17,000
player.

1682
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Is it, is it going to be a big miss for them if they click on stuff and just kind of like

1683
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
has a quick update, doesn't feel like anything really changed.

1684
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
So it's sort of like where we want to optimize things.

1685
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I think when you look at content, like the, like the pit, you know, and a lot of things

1686
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,000
we did in Helltide as well, you know, we've made a lot of attempts to try to make sure

1687
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
that the content feels like there is less friction, you know, as you're going through.

1688
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
So like when you get into a flow state that you're, that you're happy with, uh, that you

1689
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
can kind of maintain that, that, that pace.

1690
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
So, and we made a number of changes we already called out to Nightmare Dungeons to also kind

1691
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
of support this.

1692
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
So I think it's a question of like how much further do we want to go within Nightmare

1693
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Dungeons specifically, right?

1694
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Because I think we've already said that we're looking at this for other, other pieces of content.

1695
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Um, I don't know where we're going to fall necessarily for the, uh, for the, the channel

1696
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
time for clicking on, uh, objects and freeing them.

1697
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
It could be that it comes out a little bit lower.

1698
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
It could be that we decide we want to make changes to make it more, more instantaneous.

1699
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
We haven't really made a decision.

1700
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
You know, we'll continue to be looking at feedback as we play.

1701
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And also from like different players, like players who are just playing Diablo 4 for the

1702
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
first time, want to kind of hear what their experience is like as well.

1703
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Awesome.

1704
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Uh, so here's kind of like a, here's kind of like maybe a huge question, but it asks very

1705
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:25,000
directly.

1706
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Um, so what is kind of the future of the overworld in Diablo 4?

1707
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
When we first released, it was kind of the main thing you used to do everything.

1708
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And kind of the first experience was that 50 to 100 grind.

1709
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Now one to 100 is much easier.

1710
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And the focus is probably, you know, having, enjoying that journey, going to the pit and

1711
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
anything in the future that you're going to release.

1712
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:52,000
A lot of the things that seem to come out though, the abattoir and the challenge riff thing

1713
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
and the pit, they're all instanced things.

1714
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Are there big plans for the overworld?

1715
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Is that still like the defining characteristic of Diablo 4?

1716
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Or are we moving away from that?

1717
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,000
So we, you know, Diablo 4 and the fact that we have this like big contiguous sanctuary is

1718
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
still a really big part of Diablo 4.

1719
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Now, uh, I think that we want to continue to expand the, uh, the landmass and the areas

1720
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
where players can explore.

1721
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
That's still an important part of things.

1722
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
But in terms of how players are engaging with the experience overall, we do expect that,

1723
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,000
um, one of the, one of the downsides of the, uh, of the, the open world, uh, is that it

1724
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
is a, it's a fixed layout, right?

1725
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,000
So if we think about like the sorts of things that players like to play in a, in a, in a,

1726
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
in a, like a replayable content fashion, right?

1727
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
It's not normally in place where you like really want to keep running through exactly the

1728
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,000
same, uh, glade in the fracture piece or exactly the same area, you know, of Keteristan.

1729
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Like it's, it's, it's usually, you're trying to like find like different things to kind

1730
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
of go engage with.

1731
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
And like our dungeon systems are places where you can really do a lot more of that.

1732
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
I think we push it really well within Helltides.

1733
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You know, there's lots of things happening in Helltides.

1734
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Uh, they're pretty procedural in terms of how things respond in and like what sorts of events

1735
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
you might find as you're kind of wandering around.

1736
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Uh, but in terms of like having a lot more like flexibility to create different experiences,

1737
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
we have that really more in other systems.

1738
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
But I think for, this is like, uh, going back to some things I talked about the other day.

1739
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
But there's sort of like the experience that a player has, Diablo is a, is a, is a big

1740
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:16,000
game, right?

1741
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
And, uh, and I don't say that to suggest that any, any, anyone's needs are less important,

1742
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
just that there are a lot of different needs.

1743
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Different players have different expectations.

1744
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
So when some players come into Diablo, like they're here because they want to go through

1745
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
like this epic story.

1746
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
They want to play their, they really want to play a sorceress and they want to like see

1747
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
what happens to Lola if they want to go explore all, they want to find all the things

1748
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
in all the zones and they want to get really, really powerful.

1749
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
And then they're going to, they're going to take a break until the expansion comes out.

1750
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
That's just the way that they sort of play these games.

1751
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
It's how they, that's how they play, right?

1752
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
For those players, these moments as they explore the world, it's really, really important because

1753
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
that's their experience with Diablo.

1754
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,000
It's like their exploration of the overworld, them going and finding all these side quests,

1755
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
talking to all these characters, and that's their relationship with the game.

1756
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,000
For players who play seasonally, you know, they, it's, it's once you've kind of like uncovered

1757
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
all the applications, since you've found all these things and done this stuff, you don't,

1758
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,000
there's not usually a lot of reasons why you want to go and have that same moment of discovery

1759
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
again.

1760
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
You can't really recreate it.

1761
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
We talked for a while about like moving little statues around season to season.

1762
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
So you'd have to collect them again.

1763
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
It's, it's, it's another, another one of my brilliant ideas.

1764
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
So we didn't, we didn't do it of course.

1765
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Right.

1766
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
But like we had the idea of like every season we'd move where the little statues could

1767
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:22,000
be found.

1768
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
So players have to go find them again.

1769
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
But then the next conversation is immediately like, well, okay, so people are going to go

1770
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
on to maximum or whatever, and they're going to go immediately see where the node map

1771
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
is for the next set of ultra little.

1772
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Then that's now their new homework they have to do at the beginning of every season.

1773
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
They have to run around on their horse and go collect every single one of these.

1774
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:38,000
And it's like, is that fun?

1775
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
No, clearly not for that, for that player.

1776
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
It, but it wasn't, it was necessarily horrible.

1777
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
The first time players do this, like that's, that's part of the fun of like, almost like

1778
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
an open world game.

1779
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Anyway, it's kind of like exploration and finding things.

1780
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,000
So I know that I'm, I'm, I'm getting to go long, but so I think that the, the, the

1781
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
underpinning point here is that the, the overworld of Diablo four is so really, really important.

1782
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
As we think about how to make the best use of it for like replayable content, you know,

1783
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
hell tide is a good example of this.

1784
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Blood harvest is really, really, really, really helpful for kind of giving us some like

1785
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
ideas of what players are really excited about things that we could do better.

1786
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Like the like kind of light social gameplay of summoning creatures and things.

1787
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
And I think we have other ideas we continue to explore in that direction.

1788
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I think Legion events and boss events are things we continue to like kind of iterate

1789
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
on and think more about, you know, but, uh, I think that in terms of creating like, like

1790
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,000
really compelling replayable content, I think it's going to end up being in more of the

1791
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,000
space where you have like more procedural control over how like the dungeon is formulated or like

1792
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
what players can expect to encounter as opposed to these, uh, these more fixed outdoor locations.

1793
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Does that answer your question?

1794
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Yeah.

1795
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
So I guess laughing at me, I didn't answer the question.

1796
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
No, no.

1797
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Boy, these are such in-depth answers.

1798
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I'm, I'm just scared.

1799
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I'm looking over at my questions.

1800
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I'm, I'm never going to, I'm trying to figure out how to skip around for all of them.

1801
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So I guess I'm so sorry.

1802
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,000
No, no, no.

1803
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:02,000
So the main takeaway that I'm getting there is the overworld is a super important part

1804
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
of it.

1805
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Like a first player's experience discovering everything, but then it's hard to recreate that

1806
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
magic for the people that comes season to season to season.

1807
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,000
And that's why it goes more to instance stuff is kind of, I guess the summary of,

1808
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
the summary of it.

1809
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Yeah.

1810
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
That's reasonable.

1811
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Yeah.

1812
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,000
And I think we're also just on a regular basis looking for new ways to engage with the, uh,

1813
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
with the open world in ways that are going to be fun for seasonal players as well.

1814
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Like, so we're, we're, we're continuing to find like just experimenting with things,

1815
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
see what makes it like fun and new for players.

1816
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Okay.

1817
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I promised I would ask this.

1818
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
So there, uh, maybe there might be a player out there that you guys have heard of and

1819
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
have maybe added, I don't know, hundreds of hours of overtime to the team, Rob and Rob.

1820
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
You're familiar.

1821
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Just a little familiar.

1822
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Yeah.

1823
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,000
So he had a,

1824
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Rob, love Rob.

1825
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:51,000
He is a good guy.

1826
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
He is a good guy.

1827
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
He had a two questions about the pit.

1828
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:01,000
These are probably a little bit more straightforward, but, um, I guess for, for end game activities

1829
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
is do you guys ever think about or worry about, I guess, fishing?

1830
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:12,000
So like it gets to a point in the pit where, oh, you're fishing for the right mob type or

1831
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
you're fishing for the right boss or, and then you just leave kind of like what happened in

1832
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Diablo three or, oh, I'm going to go get a very on and hopefully that it procs the,

1833
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
the amazing shrine for me.

1834
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
So then I can finally win.

1835
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And do you guys off the top of your head know about how much the health in the pit

1836
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
was buffed by?

1837
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,000
And I, I'm guessing that the main idea for there is not only to add difficulty, but to

1838
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:42,000
actually, because the, when you were going through the pit, the bills are so strong that

1839
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,000
you delete the, the rift part of it in two minutes, like clockwork every time.

1840
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And the monsters don't even get to do anything.

1841
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,000
So I assume like the part of the reason for buffing it is to actually even let them get

1842
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
a hit on you and see what they even do.

1843
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Yeah.

1844
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Yeah.

1845
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I can take the first part of the question at least.

1846
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I mean, I can take both too.

1847
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Joe wants to take the other part.

1848
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
So talking about fishing.

1849
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Yes.

1850
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Fishing for stuff keeps me up at night and I hate the problem.

1851
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
And it's a really hard problem to solve.

1852
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Remember that no salute, you know, rarely perfect solutions, only trade offs thing.

1853
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Right.

1854
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
So this very much applies to this type of problem.

1855
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Right.

1856
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
A core thing that we want in our game is, and when it comes to combat and effects and

1857
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
legendary powers and unique powers and whatever, is we want to push the elbow, make cool shit.

1858
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Right.

1859
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
So on one end of the spectrum, you need to make cool stuff.

1860
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Right.

1861
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And that involves doing things that aren't necessarily completely deterministic because

1862
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I think completely deterministic things after a while get kind of boring.

1863
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Right.

1864
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
When you know that you're going to get this effect or it's up all the time, or you do this

1865
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
and get this, like we do it a lot, by the way.

1866
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So I'm not saying that's not a good design, but just.

1867
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
You need to have some spiciness, some really cool, crazy things.

1868
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Right.

1869
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
And that, that unique, uh, uber unique power is one of those.

1870
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Um, on the flip side though, it means that when you make really hard content, uh, doing

1871
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
things like wanting to make cool stuff, uh, fishing gets in the way of that a lot of times,

1872
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
especially in randomly generated content, which is what, you know, the pit is in many ways.

1873
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
So that is why we have to do things that we, that by the way, we as designers don't like,

1874
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
like removing the fun shrines or the things that are going to break, because then you

1875
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
just find the shrines that, you know, break the game in whatever way.

1876
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And that's all that you're doing.

1877
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
And that becomes the game.

1878
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Um, this is a core thing about ARPGs that I, in my opinion, after working on it now for

1879
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,000
years, and I've been involved in pretty much every game genre extensively as a player and

1880
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,000
many as a designer.

1881
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Um, I think ARPGs are one of the hardest, if not the hardest genre to design for.

1882
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Uh, MMOs are really high up there too.

1883
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Um, there's a lot of other genres I think are very difficult, but ARPGs are a special

1884
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,000
slice of, of awfulness when it comes to trying to make things fun and also make them interesting.

1885
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Um, and this is one of the reasons why.

1886
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,000
So as far as like this exact design of the spear, uh, we're keeping it in for now.

1887
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Um, I would be very sad if we had to redesign it because it's the only way to get through

1888
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
high pit tiers.

1889
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
That would make me personally sad, but because that is the most difficult thing to do, uh,

1890
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
we may have to make a tweak to it, but we're not doing it yet.

1891
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
We're going to see how it plays out.

1892
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Um, but I think that the conversation is more interesting of conceptually, like, you know,

1893
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
is this a problem?

1894
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Yes, absolutely.

1895
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Does it mean that we can't do things that would otherwise be cool and awesome for your

1896
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,000
average player?

1897
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Yes, absolutely.

1898
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
But we also think it's best for the game because I think fishing for the right tile set,

1899
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,000
the right mob, like restarting a thing over and over to be able to progress is not

1900
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:29,000
fun.

1901
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Um, and therefore we have to design the rest of our game knowing that that is a pain.

1902
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Um, yeah, just adding to that too, like, I think that, you know, we definitely see fishing

1903
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:42,000
as a problem so much so that we built the gauntlet, you know, for the trials feature with fishing

1904
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
specifically as the thing we're trying to account for.

1905
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Where we said, all right, if we, if we have a competitive content feature players going

1906
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
to engage with and it's randomized, then players aren't really competing until they find

1907
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
exactly the right seed that they managed to roll to compete against.

1908
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Cause that's the actual optimal seed that they need to compete on, compete on.

1909
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:02,000
It's only against this monster family or only with this dungeon tile layout or only with

1910
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
this, like these set of shrines or whatever it is.

1911
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
So instead what we did is we made a highly deterministic content type that changed it

1912
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:08,000
every week.

1913
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Like, and players went to it and said like, well, why is it so fixed?

1914
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Like, this is boring.

1915
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Like I want, I want something like, I want something that's, that's different and changes

1916
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
every time.

1917
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
But then you kind of fall back to that same point that I brought up about like curse,

1918
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
like these, the trade-offs for all the problems that we have.

1919
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Then we, we have to decide like, all right, so we okay with the idea that like players

1920
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
are going to go into a, like a gauntlet run and they're gonna have a wildly disparate

1921
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
experience potentially between person A and person B.

1922
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And they're just continually running the, the content over and over again in the hopes

1923
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
they eventually get a good seed.

1924
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
And that might be the way that they're able to place because the difference could potentially

1925
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
be vast between one thing and the next.

1926
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
So it's a, you know, it's a complicated space.

1927
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Something we definitely think about.

1928
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:49,000
The other part of your question was what, what did we do about the, what did we do about

1929
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
like health scaling in the pit?

1930
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
The HP, how much did it go up by?

1931
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Yeah.

1932
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
So we did make some big changes there.

1933
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:00,000
So basically what was happening in the PTR is that monster scaling, monster health scaling was

1934
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
pretty mild in the pit going through the first hundred levels.

1935
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
It was basically virtually nil, you know, from level 100 on more or less.

1936
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Right.

1937
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:14,000
So we ended up putting it in a place where like the tier 200 pit is like, okay.

1938
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:20,000
So like, like around tier 150 pit is like close to where AOZ was, you know, for like tier

1939
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
25 AOZ runs and tier 200 goes beyond that.

1940
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
So it's pretty, it's pretty considerable.

1941
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
The scaling has been increased.

1942
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
We still want it to be gradual as you're kind of progressing through.

1943
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Because we want you to feel that you have a place to push.

1944
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
It's not like, so like, because AOZ was 25 tiers, extremely, extremely chunky.

1945
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
When you went from tier to tier, as you got deeper and deeper inside here, it's a little

1946
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,000
more gradual as you go further and further.

1947
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
And we think that that's going to be good experience overall.

1948
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Because it's ultimately a lot of the materials you really want from the pit, you can gain

1949
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
by the time you're like doing like tier 60s.

1950
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
You start to get like little bits of the deeth iron that you need to kind of start finishing

1951
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,000
off your masterwork items.

1952
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
And then that gets more and more efficient as you go deeper and deeper, you know, but there's

1953
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
the, but we do want to have these like really, really difficult challenges.

1954
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:06,000
We made a, we made a decision at the launch period of the game where we took nightmare

1955
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
dungeons difficulty.

1956
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
We kind of scaled it in a different way, you know, whereas like initially they were

1957
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
extremely challenging going up to tier 100 and we ended up making a reduction in their

1958
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,000
difficulty going into season one where we basically rebalanced things such that like

1959
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
the tier 75 old nightmare dungeon was the new tier 100 nightmare dungeon.

1960
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,000
And players no longer had that, like that measuring stick, that really, really difficult content

1961
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
anymore because we kind of took it away.

1962
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
We want that to still be there in the pit.

1963
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I mean, I think if tier 200 is far beyond abattoir of 025, especially with some of like

1964
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,000
the balancing and the bug fixes to a lot of different builds, I actually, I don't know,

1965
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
maybe I'm wrong, but I expect that to be pretty challenging.

1966
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
I don't think people are going to do that as a cakewalk.

1967
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Okay.

1968
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
So we have eight minutes left.

1969
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I already cut off my timer.

1970
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
There's no way I can get to 99% of these questions.

1971
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
So how do we feel about maybe doing a little rapid fire?

1972
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Let's do it.

1973
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Okay.

1974
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Sure.

1975
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Yeah.

1976
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
This was talked about yesterday.

1977
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
If I remember correctly, this was the, so these are the top, top questions from YouTube.

1978
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
So I promised I would ask them.

1979
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
So here we go.

1980
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,000
This was the number one question by far, and it was touched on a little bit yesterday.

1981
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Is there an armory coming?

1982
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I heard yesterday, I think if I quote you correctly, you said that armory is great.

1983
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
The team, the team likes it, had to prioritize some things.

1984
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Will an armory be coming to Diablo 4 so we can save our builds?

1985
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:33,000
If you can answer it.

1986
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Yeah.

1987
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I mean, this is a problem that I think that the players have.

1988
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I think I've already mentioned that we're like, we're in the business of trying to

1989
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
like solve player problems.

1990
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
It's a thing we're really excited about.

1991
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
It's a thing we, it's a thing we would like to do.

1992
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And that's all I can say right now.

1993
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
They're excited about it guys.

1994
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Okay.

1995
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
There's lots of different ways to expand the game.

1996
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:59,000
And as Joe put it yesterday, different slices of, of the pizza to give you power.

1997
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Again, from YouTube, it seems like the most requested way that people would like to expand

1998
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
power or change their builds is to have this skill tree expanded.

1999
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Is that something that we can look forward to at some point coming to Diablo 4?

2000
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Is the team passionate about expanding the skill tree in multiple ways?

2001
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Maybe you'll even give us an ultimate button so we can get another skill.

2002
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
You never know.

2003
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Yeah.

2004
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I'll, I'll take this one, I guess.

2005
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Unless you want to say some more.

2006
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I would say I have, we have nothing to announce about big updates to the skill tree.

2007
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
It is a little bit more of a complicated problem because we want the skill tree to remain as

2008
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,000
an easy gateway for new players and returning players to come back and kind of know what

2009
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
that is.

2010
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And we didn't want the complexity and heft of our game to be there.

2011
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
So it comes with some nasty trade-offs that I'm not sure that we're willing to make, but

2012
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:56,000
we are open to the idea of adding some more depth to the skill tree, but we don't want

2013
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
it to be super complicated.

2014
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
It's not going to be the POE encyclopedia.

2015
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
We don't, we don't want that.

2016
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
At least not for our game.

2017
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
We want it to be in crafting in other places.

2018
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Yeah.

2019
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
If I could show like the, like seeing how different players, like, again, there's a lot of people

2020
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
who like, this is their first Diablo game.

2021
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Like seeing what players did with the skill tree in testing.

2022
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Yeah.

2023
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
I think it would be very surprising to you and your audience.

2024
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
They take, they take all the generators and max them to five.

2025
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Absolutely.

2026
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Yeah.

2027
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
And other things like that.

2028
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Um, it's, it's a tougher problem.

2029
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I think a lot of people give it credit for, and I don't know that the juice is worth the

2030
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
squeeze if we go too far, but hearing that people want more, we've heard that loud and

2031
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
clear, but nothing to announce in the near, in the immediate future.

2032
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Okay.

2033
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:42,000
The next one for repeated and summoning content now and in the future of the game, are there

2034
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,000
plans to let people just resummon these bosses without resetting the instance?

2035
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Cause that eats up a lot of time for the people that do want to farm up a bunch of things and

2036
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
kill some bosses.

2037
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Yeah.

2038
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Yeah.

2039
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Yeah.

2040
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Yeah.

2041
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
This is a really, this is a really good idea.

2042
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Um, there's a lot of things that get cleaned up.

2043
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Uh, when a plate, when players were set a dungeon that makes it a lot easier for us to do this

2044
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
in the first place.

2045
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Uh, let me take that back to the team.

2046
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I don't, I don't know that we've talked deeply about like exactly when we could deliver something

2047
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
like this, but we definitely see it as a, we definitely see it as a, something that

2048
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
you can improve.

2049
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
So yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll take that back.

2050
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
All right.

2051
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Um, last one from YouTube here, will the campaign receive further attention?

2052
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
So, um, we'll, well, first of all, obviously probably the story continues with the expansion,

2053
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:37,000
but, um, uh, another way is currently when you start up a new season of Diablo, you can,

2054
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,000
you can go through the campaign again, if you want, or you can probably now go farm in

2055
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:47,000
helltide and the helltide is going to level you a million times faster for a million, million

2056
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
more rewards.

2057
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,000
It's not close at all.

2058
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
And some games let you force you to do the campaign.

2059
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Some games in Diablo 4, you don't have to.

2060
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Have you guys thought about maybe editing the campaign slightly for a replay, maybe taking

2061
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:07,000
out like the camel escort for, for example, and maybe benchmarking, oh, how long does it

2062
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
take to do a campaign?

2063
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Just normally playing.

2064
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
What is it?

2065
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Three hours for us.

2066
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I don't know what it would be.

2067
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
And then benchmarking what it would be to do it in helltide and kind of have them at

2068
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:23,000
the same point at the end of those journeys, um, to allow players a real choice in how they

2069
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
want to start out their new season, because the campaign was such a fan favorite on the

2070
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
launch and it was very well done.

2071
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Sure.

2072
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
So I think if there is a, uh, like the quest team has a lot of really cool ideas of things

2073
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
that you want to do to allow for players to like replay the campaign or to make it, um,

2074
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
to kind of edit it a little bit in some ways that you suggest.

2075
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I think that, uh, it's a thing that we're thinking about as we go.

2076
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Uh, but the, we know that we want to make sure that we are prioritizing the piece of

2077
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
the game that need work first.

2078
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,000
If that makes sense.

2079
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Like, I think that the idea of being able to replay campaign is very, very exciting.

2080
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Uh, and I think there's really neat things we can do.

2081
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
And we do have plans in the future for, uh, for this stuff as well.

2082
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
I don't want to like make it sound like we're not committing to anything here.

2083
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
We kind of do, we want to do something like this.

2084
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,000
It's just that there's a lot of other like replay features like helltide, for example,

2085
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
that we thought are, we're in a great position to like lift up and make feel like more exciting

2086
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
for players.

2087
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
So that's been a, more of a priority for us, but I do think that there's opportunities

2088
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
there for sure.

2089
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Something there I want to point out, and this would help when the community is discussing

2090
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,000
things or when you even are with us is this idea of opportunity cost.

2091
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I don't know if you know what, are you familiar with that term racks?

2092
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Yeah.

2093
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Economics.

2094
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Yeah.

2095
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Give up something to gain something else.

2096
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Cool.

2097
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Then, then I don't have to explain it, but yeah, the opportunity cost comes very heavy

2098
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:36,000
into play.

2099
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
When we talk about features and suggestions and things from players, I think a lot of times

2100
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
it can be frustrating as a member of a community because I'm a member of gaming communities

2101
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:44,000
too.

2102
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
So I know how it is.

2103
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I'm like, Hey, you know, this thing, we obviously, it sounds like a good idea and we

2104
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:48,000
all agree.

2105
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
It's a good idea.

2106
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Why don't the devs do it right away?

2107
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:54,000
And most of the time when that is true, it's because of opportunity costs.

2108
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
It's that the excited opportunity costs are something that you didn't realize makes it

2109
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
harder than it seems.

2110
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,000
But opportunity costs, you know, here it's like, do we do loot reborn?

2111
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Do we redo how all the loot works in the game and your, your entire leveling experience

2112
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
with our updates to helltide?

2113
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Or do we make the campaign have parody with not doing campaign to level up?

2114
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Right now, having campaign have parody to the non campaign obviously is a good thing,

2115
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:20,000
but I would argue very heavily that loop being better in a loop based game is more important

2116
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
and impacts more people in a better way, in a more long-term way.

2117
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,000
And then the list goes long and long, forever, forever of the things that you could do versus

2118
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
what you have to decide to do.

2119
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
And then the other part, kind of alluding to your last question about resummoning bosses

2120
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:38,000
is that I would say in that one, like, yeah, obviously good idea, better player experience

2121
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,000
in there.

2122
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I would say the reason why we're not doing it, just knowing how the game works a little

2123
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
bit more is Excel.

2124
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Our game wasn't structured that way.

2125
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
And we have to do a lot of things to make it structured that way.

2126
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:51,000
And the answer to actually do it is harder than most people would think.

2127
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,000
And that is why both of these things are obviously good ideas that we would want.

2128
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
There's different reasons why we haven't done them yet.

2129
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Doesn't mean they won't happen, but it means that it's why they're not happening now or yet.

2130
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,000
And that's a better way to frame it when people are talking to each other.

2131
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,000
It's like, hey, what should the Diablo X4 team do first or now?

2132
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Or, hey, you know, maybe this is a little bit harder.

2133
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Could you explain why it's harder would be a good question for an interviewer, for example,

2134
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:15,000
right?

2135
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Because then you're going to get actual insight into why rather than just complaining that

2136
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
it's not happening.

2137
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Are you providing Rack's feedback on this?

2138
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I mean, I might be giving feedback on feedback.

2139
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
That's part of my job too.

2140
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
But I like productive conversations is why.

2141
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,000
And I think the community would rather have more productive conversations than their only

2142
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
avenue is to complain and not know why things aren't working the way that they want.

2143
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I think people want to know how things work.

2144
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
I think that makes sense.

2145
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I think they want to know how things work.

2146
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I want to educate people so that we can have better conversations about games.

2147
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I mean, I'm a loser, guys.

2148
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I'm always here if you guys ever want to talk, which we're actually at time.

2149
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Want to ask one more?

2150
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:55,000
All right.

2151
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:03,000
I mean, probably the one that I'm just going to ask a 15-part question then to abuse the

2152
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
one more.

2153
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I love it.

2154
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Gamer at heart.

2155
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Probably the most important one that's still left on the list is about social features.

2156
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
So I have three main topics.

2157
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
I can't believe how many questions I put here.

2158
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
That was so stupid of me.

2159
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I mean, there's no chance at all.

2160
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Anyway, social features.

2161
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
So there's three main things.

2162
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Trading, group finder, clans.

2163
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:38,000
So with trading, what are your guys' thoughts on putting an auction house-esque type of thing

2164
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,000
just to allow trading and to avoid third-party sites?

2165
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Obviously, not a real money auction house.

2166
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
People are begging for a group finder.

2167
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I don't know why.

2168
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
People have cooties.

2169
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I rather play by myself.

2170
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
But I guess people want it.

2171
02:01:54,000 --> 02:02:00,000
And then clans, I understand there's a big difficulty with clans.

2172
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Not just implementing them.

2173
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
They were implemented in Diablo 3.

2174
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
But Diablo 3 clans mean absolutely nothing.

2175
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
It's just a second friends list.

2176
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
There's no achievements to do.

2177
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
There's nothing to unlock.

2178
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
There's nothing to work toward.

2179
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:19,000
But then if you put that in the game, opportunity costs, the thing that the economic principle

2180
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:25,000
we keep talking about, then if you build that in the game, then people have to belong

2181
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,000
to a clan.

2182
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:31,000
And otherwise, they feel left out, which then leads me to another one of my million questions

2183
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
about SSF.

2184
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:32,000
But whatever.

2185
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:38,000
So for social features, trading, group finder, clans, what are your guys' thoughts on those

2186
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,000
three for Diablo 4?

2187
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Let's get going.

2188
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:46,000
So for trading, okay, trading in Season 4, players can trade Legendaries and Uniques.

2189
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
They're still going to have to go and actually meet up to do those trades.

2190
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
There's not going to be an automated trading function.

2191
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
There are things we're talking about with regards to the Trade Chat channel to make it

2192
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,000
a little bit easier to navigate.

2193
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:01,000
In terms of creating an actual auction house user interface, it's a thing a team has discussed.

2194
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
It's not a thing we've landed on.

2195
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:07,000
We really want to see what the reaction is from players in Season 4 and what the experience

2196
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
is broadly for players in Season 4.

2197
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
How many players are actually trading?

2198
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Because I imagine it'll be different for different types of players, right?

2199
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
But I think there could potentially be room for an investment there.

2200
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Because we don't want to just push players just to third-party sites.

2201
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,000
But we're at a point where we're like, well, do we really want to go and make a whole...

2202
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Opportunity Cost would be a big investment to go make an auction house for Diablo 4, for

2203
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
example, without knowing exactly what the desire for it is going to be.

2204
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
And we didn't want to wait to let some of these things be tradable in the meantime.

2205
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
So that's the HALA version.

2206
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
We're not opposed to it.

2207
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
We want to see how things go in Season 4.

2208
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:46,000
With regards to the group finder, I think is the way that you call it, we do want to

2209
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,000
make sure that there are easier systems for players to use to find parties of players

2210
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
who are doing things that interest them.

2211
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
We do have a social team on Diablo 4.

2212
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
They've been thinking about clan stuff.

2213
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Things like this.

2214
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Things that make socialization more easy between players.

2215
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I think there'll be exciting stuff to share in the future.

2216
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
So there's things we're thinking about.

2217
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
And then with regards to...

2218
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
What's the last one?

2219
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Clans.

2220
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Of course, clans.

2221
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
We also have ideas of things we want to do to update parts of the clan functionality

2222
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
to make it just a little more engaging to give more purpose to parts of clans.

2223
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
You know, this is a thing that we have designs for and things we're thinking about.

2224
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
I can't announce anything today.

2225
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Just to say that we recognize there's some parts of social features in Diablo 4 that can

2226
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
be leveled up, made better.

2227
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,000
And there's process we see players going through as part of regular play in seasons that we

2228
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
want to make easier, more streamlined for them.

2229
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Well, I got to be honest.

2230
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
It was actually an honor to have you guys come here.

2231
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I really like you guys.

2232
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I love the Diablo franchise since I was a kid.

2233
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
This actually meant a lot to me.

2234
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I have a million more questions, but I know we're out of time.

2235
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
I want to be respectful of that.

2236
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Thank you guys.

2237
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Thank you guys for coming here and speaking so open and honestly.

2238
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I'm a loser.

2239
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I'm always here.

2240
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,000
If you guys want to go again, I mean, you guys got three free hours.

2241
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:04,000
I got a lot more questions, but I guess, is DM going next or I can just pass along a million

2242
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
more?

2243
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:05,000
I'm sure.

2244
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
I believe so.

2245
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Yeah.

2246
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,000
I'm on with him tomorrow.

2247
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Yeah.

2248
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
You guys, right?

2249
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Yeah.

2250
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:10,000
All right.

2251
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
It's been a blast.

2252
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,000
It's been super fun.

2253
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Thank you, Rex.

2254
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Really appreciate it.

2255
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I will say we're trying to get in front of the community a little bit more and talk about

2256
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:18,000
these things.

2257
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:22,000
It's something that I really like doing and I'm pretty passionate about and I'm looking

2258
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:22,000
forward to doing more.

2259
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,000
So thank you guys for being here.

2260
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Talk to us.

2261
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Hell yeah.

2262
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Let's do it again.

2263
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Thank you guys.

2264
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Everybody in chat, say goodbye to the lovely people at Blizzard and I guess we'll see you

2265
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
in season four.

2266
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Thank you all.

2267
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
See you folks.

2268
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Thanks guys.

2269
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:49,000
All right.

2270
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Coming back.

2271
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Okay.

2272
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
How do I, how do I like this?

2273
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Boom.

2274
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:58,000
All right.

2275
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
I'm back.

2276
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Dude.

2277
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,000
I can't even explain to you how many questions I had to skip, man.

2278
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Yo, dude.

2279
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
I had so many more questions.

2280
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Like, oh man, dude.

2281
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Look at all the questions I missed.

2282
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
First of all, I missed all of these, almost all of these.

2283
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:25,000
And I missed loot filter, SSF, PVP, offline mode, ladders, how did the PTR go?

2284
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Map overlay.

2285
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
We kind of talked about this.

2286
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Charms, Uber, Tomb Lord, the cow level.

2287
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Why isn't Diablo and Diablo 4?

2288
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,000
What are the toughest challenges of your job?

2289
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
How did the Microsoft takeover impact you guys?

2290
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
What are the scope of your seasons and the mid-season events?

2291
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Can you make community goals and events?

2292
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Why are world bosses loot pinatas?

2293
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
What about pets and followers?

2294
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Who is the target audience for Diablo 4?

2295
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,000
I wanted to talk to them about, I just had, I don't know, man.

2296
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I don't know, man.

2297
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I was, I was pretty disheartened, man.

2298
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I had so many more questions.

2299
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Ugh.

2300
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I had so many more questions, man.

2301
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I feel like, I feel like I spent too much time talking.

2302
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Like I spent too much time maybe phrasing the question, maybe.

2303
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Then I could have gotten a couple more in.

2304
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:43,000
And I, I purposely didn't, I purposely didn't, like, I wanted to have a conversation with them about every topic.

2305
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:48,000
But if I have a conversation with them about every topic, I only get to ask two questions.

2306
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
You know?

2307
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Hmm.

2308
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Man, dude.

2309
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
I wanted to ask them so many more questions.

2310
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Man.

2311
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I, I super over prepared for that, I guess.

2312
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Man.

2313
02:08:46,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Well, did you, did you guys enjoy the conversation?

2314
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I'll tell you the most shocking thing to me.

2315
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
I literally said it in the interview.

2316
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:12,000
They block out time for the developers to play the game because they said the only way you're ever going to know anything is by playing the game.

2317
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I thought that was pretty good, man.

2318
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
What's the cliff note version?

2319
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:32,000
No.

2320
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Well.

2321
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Okay.

2322
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
So, oh, shit.

2323
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
I closed it.

2324
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
One second.

2325
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Okay.

2326
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Okay.

2327
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Yeah.

2328
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:06,000
A TLDR version? Okay.

2329
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:15,000
So the TLDR of Pinnacle content and will skill ever play a factor is,

2330
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I think the way I would summarize their answer is yes, there will,

2331
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,000
but they're still trying to find out what the right level is.

2332
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Roadmap, they said, has a lot of pros and cons.

2333
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:35,000
The pros have to outweigh the cons, but they feel committed to giving the community promises that they keep.

2334
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:43,000
When I ask them, how do you actually, how do you, how do you, by the way,

2335
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:51,000
there's so many people subbing and doing super chats and somebody gifted 50 subs.

2336
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Mr. G Point gifted 50 subs.

2337
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Thank you.

2338
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,000
And so many people are subbing and stuff.

2339
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I actually, I don't know how this happened, but it actually got,

2340
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I actually closed the notifications somehow.

2341
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
That was an accident.

2342
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Let me reopen this.

2343
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Thank you guys.

2344
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Sorry.

2345
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
I was, well, I was just a thousand percent focused on trying to,

2346
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
trying to suck blood from a mummy,

2347
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
trying to get everything I could out of that.

2348
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:31,000
There's a, there's a million people that subbed with prime and 56 month resub from Maxim.

2349
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
That's crazy.

2350
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
So there's so many of them.

2351
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Thank you guys.

2352
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Make sure I didn't miss anything crazy.

2353
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Thank you guys.

2354
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Sucking blood from a mummy.

2355
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Never heard of that.

2356
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Like a mosquito sucking blood from a mummy.

2357
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Extracting water from a stone.

2358
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Same analogy.

2359
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Okay.

2360
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:58,000
You sure sucked them hard racks.

2361
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Thanks, man.

2362
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I sure sucked them.

2363
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:01,000
All right.

2364
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Um, the, I thought, I thought that I almost threw this question out.

2365
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I actually thought this was the best question I asked them because they did say,

2366
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
we read the Reddit threads.

2367
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
We watch the streams.

2368
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
We watch the YouTube videos.

2369
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
We read the comment sections.

2370
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:22,000
We go to the forums and they said, we play the game.

2371
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,000
That's the only way you will ever really know to play the damn game.

2372
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I thought that was, I thought that was the best part.

2373
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Um,

2374
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:38,000
uh, on nightmare dungeons.

2375
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I essentially just cried and asked them, stop making me free seven prisoners and reduce the time further and let me carry multiple objects.

2376
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,000
And I think the answer was maybe.

2377
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Overworld's future.

2378
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Um, this, this is maybe the answer that kind of surprised me a little bit.

2379
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:03,000
I was kind of, I mean, what they said made perfect sense.

2380
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:07,000
They said the overworld is super fun.

2381
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Kind of the first time through afterward, you can't really recreate the magic.

2382
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
We need to just get you to the events that you want to do.

2383
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Like, I can't argue with that logic.

2384
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
That makes sense.

2385
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:31,000
But I did kind of expect them to, I guess I expected Diablo four to dot double down on the overworld's future kind of more than what I heard.

2386
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:38,000
I was actually kind of, this is probably the most surprising answer to me that.

2387
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:49,000
The overworld in general is not, not, not totally a one and done, but that's, that's what I got out of their answer.

2388
02:13:49,000 --> 02:14:05,000
You think you want it, but you don't.

2389
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Well, I just got done playing 130 hours of Elden Ring.

2390
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:15,000
And all I did was roam around in the overworld.

2391
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:19,000
And all I ever think about in my life is when am I going to play Elden Ring again?

2392
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:24,000
And when am I going to do new game plus and 30 more playthroughs of it?

2393
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I understand it's a different kind of game.

2394
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
This is an ARPG.

2395
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
You don't have to tell me I played a trillion different games, but my point is World of Warcraft.

2396
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:38,000
One of my fun is, one of my favorite things, World of Warcraft, get on the pony and ride around and go see what we can discover.

2397
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:42,000
And there's, you know, there's so many things to go do.

2398
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I wouldn't say that overworld is.

2399
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I think I want it, but I don't.

2400
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:54,000
In fact, I think one of the most fun game modes in the game is in the overworld, Helltide.

2401
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I think Helltide is more fun than Nightmare Dungeons.

2402
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,000
It might be more fun than the pit, but probably not.

2403
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,000
The pit is probably more fun currently, but it's way more fun than world bosses.

2404
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
And it's way more fun than challenge rifts.

2405
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:10,000
So, I don't know.

2406
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:19,000
I don't think they should abandon the overworld.

2407
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
That is not how I feel about it.

2408
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
These were Rob's questions.

2409
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I wanted to ask them.

2410
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
They actually said this in CJ's interview.

2411
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:44,000
They said this.

2412
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:53,000
That the Diablo 3 had some cool things that they could borrow from and some things that they didn't like.

2413
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:58,000
So, they actually kind of pseudo-admitted that it is kind of like Diablo 3.

2414
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:03,000
But I wanted to ask them, do they often take inspiration from the past games?

2415
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:11,000
And they said yesterday on CJ's stream that there will be new things that are, and this is a quote,

2416
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,000
distinctly Diablo 4, fresh and exciting.

2417
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
I wanted to ask them about this.

2418
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I wanted to ask them, are you actually innovating on ARPGs?

2419
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Distinctly Diablo 4, fresh and exciting.

2420
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Do you actually, are you actually planning to release new things that really the ARPG world has not seen?

2421
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Because that would be exciting.

2422
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Yeah.

2423
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I wanted to talk to them about said items.

2424
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,000
They talked about it yesterday on CJ's stream.

2425
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
I had more questions, man.

2426
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
I wanted to talk to them about RuneWords.

2427
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
They said that they like RuneWords.

2428
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
They were working on it, and they're going to come in Diablo 4.

2429
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,000
But I still have questions.

2430
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
I wanted to talk about charms.

2431
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
I asked all the questions from YouTube.

2432
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I forgot to write their, I forgot to say their names.

2433
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I should have said their names.

2434
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I forgot.

2435
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
God, I'm stupid.

2436
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
I should have said their names.

2437
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,000
The interview is over, yeah.

2438
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Saying names adds time.

2439
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
And then I was out of time.

2440
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
And then I said, well, probably the next best thing I could ask is about social features.

2441
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:46,000
It didn't sound like they have anything coming for trading anytime soon.

2442
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
It sounded like they actually, I was surprised.

2443
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,000
They actually sounded like they had something for clans coming.

2444
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:58,000
And they didn't sound like they had anything for trading.

2445
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,000
What did they say about group finder?

2446
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
What did I think about the interview?

2447
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Well, I liked the, Callie literally just walked up to me and farted.

2448
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Thanks for that, Callie.

2449
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Thank you.

2450
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Thank you.

2451
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Thank you.

2452
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Did you see Callie trying to crawl on me the whole interview?

2453
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
No, it's not even a drive-by.

2454
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,000
She runs up, farts, and then she sits there and wags her tail.

2455
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:37,000
She doesn't go anywhere.

2456
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Okay.

2457
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Nothing to announce, but it's being discussed.

2458
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,000
What is my overall opinion about their answers in the interview?

2459
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:17,000
It's kind of, it's hard to judge because it's hard to judge like being in the moment.

2460
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I'd probably have to go back and rewatch it to get the, to get the full, to absorb the full amount of information.

2461
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:30,000
But it felt like they were being very honest.

2462
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I don't know.

2463
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I thought that they were giving good answers to the questions that I asked.

2464
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:40,000
What Adam Jackson said at the end was exactly how I feel where he said,

2465
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:55,000
it's not really that valuable for you to ask me like a yes or no question and I give you the answer and you post it somewhere and no one ever knows the why behind anything.

2466
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:03,000
So what would be much more helpful is having in-depth conversations about opportunity costs.

2467
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Um, I'm glad that I studied economics in college because they were actually talking about a lot of economic principles.

2468
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
He's like, do you know what an opportunity cost is?

2469
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Yes.

2470
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
I love economics.

2471
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I love math.

2472
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
So that, that helped.

2473
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Um, one time, the one time college actually pays off.

2474
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Um,

2475
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
um,

2476
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
um,

2477
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:41,000
they were talking about their problems,

2478
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
their problems,

2479
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
but that's exactly,

2480
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:51,000
but that's exactly their problems by,

2481
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
by transitivity become our problems.

2482
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
If blizzard has a problem,

2483
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
it's going to become our problem.

2484
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:04,000
If blizzard has a problem implementing something,

2485
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,000
it will become our problem as players.

2486
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Someone has a super chat here.

2487
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Never call yourself a loser.

2488
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Ryan,

2489
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
you are awesome.

2490
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Thanks for saying that,

2491
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
man.

2492
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I mean,

2493
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:25,000
I am a loser.

2494
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I just sit around and play games all day,

2495
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
but I appreciate the sentiment.

2496
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
What did I major in in college?

2497
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Math.

2498
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
I have a,

2499
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I almost got a,

2500
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
I almost got a triple major.

2501
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I almost triple majored in math,

2502
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
stats,

2503
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:43,000
and economics.

2504
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I also went pretty far into psychology as well.

2505
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I like,

2506
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
I like school.

2507
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I always,

2508
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:52,000
uh,

2509
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,000
my corporate job for 10 years always gave tuition reimbursement.

2510
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
So I always went to school.

2511
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:02,000
So I got my bachelor's in math and then I had,

2512
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
I put a huge emphasis on stats,

2513
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:04,000
economics,

2514
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
and psychology.

2515
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I got my,

2516
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:06,000
uh,

2517
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:09,000
first master's in PNC insurance,

2518
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:10,000
the CPCU.

2519
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
And then I actually went for a second master's.

2520
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I'm about a third of the way done with it with an MBA.

2521
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I just like school.

2522
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
A lot of people hate school.

2523
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,000
I loved it.

2524
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I like to go and I like to go and learn not from MIT,

2525
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,000
from the university of Nebraska.

2526
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
You got a triple major math,

2527
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:27,000
computer science,

2528
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,000
and drugs.

2529
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Well,

2530
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,000
one of them will make you way more money than the other.

2531
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Just watch breaking bad.

2532
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:36,000
I'm a corn Husker.

2533
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Yeah,

2534
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:37,000
we have the,

2535
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
uh,

2536
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
we used to have the best,

2537
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,000
uh,

2538
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,000
football team ever in the history of football.

2539
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
And now we have the worst team ever.

2540
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
And we're garbage.

2541
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:47,000
We don't,

2542
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
we don't,

2543
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:48,000
uh,

2544
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
we don't talk about the current day.

2545
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Don't,

2546
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
didn't we get the number one pick though?

2547
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
We got the,

2548
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
got like the top court.

2549
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,000
We have like,

2550
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
now we have like the godliest quarterback ever.

2551
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
And we have the rest of our team sucks.

2552
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:07,000
You graduated with your cybersecurity degree this December.

2553
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Hell yeah.

2554
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I didn't go to high school.

2555
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
I went to school high.

2556
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Yeah,

2557
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
we have Riola.

2558
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
So we have,

2559
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,000
we have Nebraska has racks.

2560
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:21,000
That's a,

2561
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:21,000
uh,

2562
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:26,000
y equals MX plus B.

2563
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Good old algebra.

2564
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Yeah.

2565
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Did you hear what they said?

2566
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
You should hear how most players built.

2567
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,000
You should see the data on how most players built a skill tree.

2568
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I was like,

2569
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
what's the dumbest thing that they could do?

2570
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,000
What did they do?

2571
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Put five points in every generator.

2572
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
And Joe was like,

2573
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:50,000
yes.

2574
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I was like,

2575
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Jesus Christ,

2576
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:53,000
guys.

2577
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Max roll.

2578
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:55,000
GG.

2579
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
What is wrong with you guys?

2580
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
So yeah,

2581
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:07,000
if you guys like college football,

2582
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,000
the Nebraska corn Huskers are going to be super interesting to watch next year

2583
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:14,000
because we have the greatest quarterback ever.

2584
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,000
And our,

2585
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:19,000
the rest of our team is absolute YMCA rejects.

2586
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:23,000
So how far can one God quarterback take a team of losers?

2587
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
It's going to be like space jam.

2588
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,000
It's going to be like space jam,

2589
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
but for a football.

2590
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I'm sorry to say racks,

2591
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
but ever since you stopped making barb guides,

2592
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:44,000
you stopped following Maxwell.

2593
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:45,000
If I don't write the guide,

2594
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:46,000
you don't want to read it.

2595
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Uh,

2596
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
I can tell you,

2597
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:48,000
uh,

2598
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
the people that write the barb guides over there,

2599
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:52,000
like,

2600
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:52,000
uh,

2601
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,000
snail.

2602
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,000
And is it sloth master and snail?

2603
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Dude,

2604
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:58,000
they,

2605
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:01,000
they put a lot of effort into those guides,

2606
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:01,000
man.

2607
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
They put a lot of effort into those guides.

2608
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,000
You can snail is a many,

2609
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:08,000
many,

2610
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:14,000
many time rank one Diablo three player on almost every single class.

2611
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
He's one of the greatest players ever.

2612
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:17,000
You,

2613
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,000
you can read a guide from snail and fruit feel good about it,

2614
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
man.

2615
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:21,000
He's,

2616
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,000
he's one of the greatest Diablo players of all time.

2617
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
It doesn't have to be me.

2618
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Who writes the sorcerer builds.

2619
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,000
You ever heard of a guy named North war,

2620
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
North war,

2621
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,000
every,

2622
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
everybody follows North wars builds.

2623
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:46,000
He is,

2624
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:46,000
uh,

2625
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,000
nobody does more,

2626
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:51,000
more math in Diablo four than North war.

2627
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Nobody.

2628
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:57,000
He is the best sorcerer guide writer.

2629
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,000
In the,

2630
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
in the world by,

2631
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
by a huge margin.

2632
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
It's not even close at all.

2633
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
There I am.

2634
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
There's no way.

2635
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,000
It's not even close.

2636
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Rob's the math guy to Rob's the math guy.

2637
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Guys,

2638
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
remember Rob was on Maxwell for three years.

2639
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Rob's the math guy too.

2640
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Okay.

2641
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:34,000
What changes are coming.

2642
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,000
I didn't catch the stream.

2643
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
It wasn't really an interview about,

2644
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,000
it wasn't really an interview about changes.

2645
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Really.

2646
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,000
It,

2647
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:46,000
it's not like a spoiler thing where they can like announce a bunch of new

2648
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
things on the stream.

2649
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
It's kind of understanding how do the,

2650
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:51,000
how are they going to make the game?

2651
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,000
So kind of the,

2652
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:58,000
the high level takeaways are challenging content will be in the game,

2653
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,000
but it's never going to be all skill based again.

2654
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I don't think mechanical mastery is out and your gear is going to be a huge

2655
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:10,000
portion of you winning is what I took from that.

2656
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Um,

2657
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:15,000
they're really unsure about roadmaps,

2658
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:20,000
but they have no problem making certain promises and keeping them kind of

2659
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
sounded like a no to me from the roadmaps.

2660
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
That's how I interpreted the answer.

2661
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:30,000
They said that they block out time for the team to play the game.

2662
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
So he said like,

2663
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:32,000
for example,

2664
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
he already,

2665
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:36,000
he's going to have about 50 hours in season five.

2666
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
He said that that's by far the best way for the team to be able to play

2667
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
the game.

2668
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I,

2669
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:42,000
I,

2670
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I don't think there's any other way you could in,

2671
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
there's no other way to approach the question.

2672
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
The only way you will learn is by playing the game.

2673
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
You will never learn by sitting in an ivory tower,

2674
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:55,000
theorizing about the game.

2675
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:00,000
So that this was very refreshing to hear.

2676
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Uh,

2677
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,000
this was just me essentially just complaining and I want more qualitative stuff.

2678
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
And they said kind of like,

2679
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:08,000
maybe,

2680
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
maybe,

2681
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
this was just me bitching about everything.

2682
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Um,

2683
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:19,000
the overworld future was surprising to me.

2684
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:20,000
This is the most surprising answer.

2685
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:24,000
So the,

2686
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:28,000
they essentially said the overworld is really fun to explore the first time or

2687
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:28,000
two.

2688
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:32,000
And then people want to get to their events.

2689
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:32,000
I mean,

2690
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
that's probably true,

2691
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
but I mean,

2692
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
we have a big overworld here.

2693
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
There's gotta be something we can do with it.

2694
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Right?

2695
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,000
You're coping.

2696
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:49,000
You're coping.

2697
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:52,000
They said no to Insta interactions.

2698
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Well,

2699
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I don't know if they said no.

2700
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
They said that they thought that they could bring it down further.

2701
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I thought pretty sure they said that,

2702
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:58,000
right?

2703
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
That they'd look into bringing it down further.

2704
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Well,

2705
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:05,000
no guys,

2706
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:10,000
it's not that it's not that the overworld is not going to expand.

2707
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Right?

2708
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:11,000
I mean,

2709
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
it's very logical that with the expansion,

2710
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,000
there will be new zones and things to ride around in.

2711
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,000
It's not that the overworld is never going to get bigger.

2712
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
What I was asking them is,

2713
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:30,000
is the overworld going to be a defining feature of the future of the game?

2714
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Are we going to be spending a lot of time in the overworld for future

2715
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:35,000
activities?

2716
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
And what they said was,

2717
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:42,000
is the overworld is kind of a one or two time thing where it's interesting.

2718
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,000
And then people want to get to where they want to go.

2719
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:51,000
So certainly the overworld will be expanded upon,

2720
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:54,000
but that's not the same as,

2721
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
is it a defining feature?

2722
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
So.

2723
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:10,000
We're going to wait to,

2724
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
We will put it on the other side.

2725
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
And then people want to open it up here.

2726
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
So you can adjust them down to the other side.

2727
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,000
We're going to click here.

2728
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:20,000
See you next time.

2729
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Bye.

2730
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,000
We will not hit the endlich button,

2731
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:22,000
but you can adjust those first icons to the target.

2732
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
?

2733
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
We have to go through or see how something happens.

2734
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Have to go out and see how something happens.

2735
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,000
And the first thing we can do is,

2736
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
that's going to have to go through it.

2737
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
We have to work with our traumas

2738
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,000
and theThree days and the other side,

2739
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
how,

2740
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
let's focus on testing this sequence?

2741
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Or testя,

2742
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:49,000
okay let's do some poll let's do that's a good idea let's do some polls about the

2743
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
how you guys felt who cares what i think let's see what you guys think

2744
02:30:52,000 --> 02:31:00,000
how did you feel about the interview everything about it

2745
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:08,000
how it was done the questions and the answers just everything as a whole

2746
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:14,000
you thought it was godly you thought it was great you thought it was meh

2747
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:20,000
you thought it was terrible you thought it was horrendous create the poll

2748
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:25,000
let's paste the poll if you want to vote

2749
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:32,000
there it is i pasted it a million times results let's see how did you guys feel about it

2750
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:40,000
the the whole entirety of it how it was everything about it me alt blizzard everything lumped into one

2751
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,000
all right

2752
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
it's pretty good i'll take that

2753
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:17,000
it was that was that's what i was going to ask from you guys what

2754
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:24,000
banned the 22 people i wouldn't give them uh i wouldn't ban somebody for having an opinion

2755
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:30,000
that didn't align with mine as long if people state their opinions and they're different than mine

2756
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:37,000
as long as they aren't being toxic about it uh i don't have any problem with them it's when people

2757
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:43,000
voice opinions to me and they're being toxic about it that i swap them away

2758
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:47,000
okay um

2759
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
okay so

2760
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:59,000
what feedback do you guys have about how it could have been better either i mean it's really not up to

2761
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:07,000
them to do better it's up to me to do better so it could have been a longer interview what can i do better

2762
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
um

2763
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
i need to ask questions quicker

2764
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
not be a simp

2765
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:32,000
i was being a simp for diablo 4 you know i hear some content creators get called this

2766
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:41,000
some content creators get called a simp i actually don't get that too much

2767
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:46,000
i'm kind of surprised to hear that

2768
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,000
it's usually just not feedback that i get very often

2769
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
joe needs to talk less but

2770
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,000
here's the thing though

2771
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:17,000
i it's kind of like adam said kind of at the end of the thing

2772
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,000
i think it is much more helpful

2773
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:31,000
to have insights and deep dives into conversations than to do the rapid fire in your i could have asked

2774
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:35,000
50 questions if i would have done it will there be charms in diablo 4

2775
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:41,000
will there be set items in diablo 4 but

2776
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:46,000
last epoch has set items and they're terrible

2777
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:53,000
diablo 3's entire game is based on overpowered sets and it pretty much ruined the game

2778
02:34:53,000 --> 02:35:01,000
diablo 2 has some godly sets and some of them are completely useless even after the repass of what

2779
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,000
they did of them so

2780
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:09,000
when you tell me set if they would say yes sets are coming into the game that doesn't tell me anything

2781
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:20,000
what i want to know is what do you think about sets let's have a conversation about what works about sets and what doesn't that's the

2782
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
that's that's the important thing to me

2783
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:31,000
so when you say joe talks too much

2784
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:42,000
i would not coach him to talk less because i want to have conversations about it

2785
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:51,000
one hour is too short of a time to ask detailed questions

2786
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:56,000
most of the segments should be rapid fire otherwise you don't cover anything if you had

2787
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:00,000
two or three hours it would have been a different story barely any questions were covered

2788
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:06,000
yeah i think that's the i think that's the main point of feedback is more time

2789
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:15,000
well one of the questions well some of the questions that i started off with which i thought were the

2790
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:21,000
most important they already discussed it yesterday and i cannot assume that people watched

2791
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:29,000
rikers interview like i did so i had to i wanted to start off with here's what you guys said already

2792
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
okay here's what you said yesterday now here's my question here's the part that

2793
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:36,000
i'm missing here

2794
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:52,000
yeah i mean again if i could have had a conversation about things when adam jackson was talking about

2795
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:59,000
balancing the campaign i mean i have a pretty simple solution which i which i think is i mean again

2796
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:08,000
opportunity cost how long does it take them to do it versus what's the benefit added i can

2797
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:23,000
i can go through um i can go through um hell tide and play for whatever five hours and oh i'm level 65

2798
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:31,000
and i have a full set of basic ancestral gear and i have two or three legendaries that are good for me

2799
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:38,000
that's where i get in five hours or something and then i go play the campaign and the campaign

2800
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:45,000
takes me five hours and when i'm done with it i'm level 43 and i have mostly yellows and two legendaries

2801
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:54,000
and then i say okay if you design redesign the campaign completely with all the new smart loot

2802
02:37:54,000 --> 02:38:01,000
and this or that or this or that then it's a huge undertaking right so what about this leave the

2803
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:08,000
campaign as it is forget it just leave it as it is and the only thing that you do is cut out some of the

2804
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:17,000
the ridiculous parts like maybe walking around the snake 300 times or the camel escort quest where you're

2805
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:25,000
sitting there for 20 minutes there's the slowest camel ever following it and then you say all right the

2806
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:34,000
time now is uh four hours or something or whatever it is and then you you benchmark that compared to

2807
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:45,000
about where would you be gear wise and xp wise um at the end of the run you could do it you could do it

2808
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:53,000
very cheaply actually you could just play the campaign you kill uber you kill lilith at whatever level 42

2809
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:06,000
and once you kill lilith you go to level 60 in world tier 4 you just you just ding 60 boom you're 60

2810
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:13,000
you're in world tier 4 and you get a little good lilith drops lilith's goodie bag and she drops you

2811
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:19,000
a decent set of eye level whatever 800 ancestral gear put it on it's about the same

2812
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:27,000
that requires almost no changes in the campaign nothing you didn't change anything and when you

2813
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:32,000
kill lilith you just ding roughly the level and roughly the gear that you would have had

2814
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:41,000
if you would have played in helltide that sounds lame though but that sounds lame to you people love the

2815
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:52,000
the campaign the whole point is to give another choice people who say that's lame that's you

2816
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
i would personally love that

2817
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:01,000
see

2818
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:19,000
some people in diablo 4 would rather do the campaign again and arrive at the same spot than run 15 helltides

2819
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:29,000
you know to know what let's let's not leave it up to interpretation

2820
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:32,000
no guessing answer let's just ask the question

2821
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,000
assuming

2822
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,000
reasonable

2823
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:43,000
campaign changes meaning you don't have to wait for the camel for an hour

2824
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:51,000
which is more fun to level if you arrived at the same point for the same amount of time

2825
02:40:51,000 --> 02:41:01,000
i don't i don't expect i don't i'm not expecting this poll to be lopsided i'm expecting it to be a balance

2826
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:10,000
helltide blasting or the campaign but let's see if i'm wrong let's let's just see what happens what would

2827
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:11,000
be more fun for you

2828
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:20,000
i spammed it what would you rather do if you arrived at the same point and they made some basic

2829
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
quality of life changes to the campaign

2830
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
okay i didn't actually expect the campaign to win but

2831
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:44,000
this is what i i expected it to not have a landslide victory for either of them so

2832
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:52,000
what someone says is stupid to you is way more fun for 420 people kek w

2833
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,000
well

2834
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:12,000
i don't think about it

2835
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:27,000
talking about kilowatt com

2836
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:43,000
guys another thing is

2837
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:54,000
this is this if they took this development time other than the opportunity cost of development

2838
02:42:54,000 --> 02:43:03,000
time on some other feature this situation is just a win for everybody even if you're just helltide

2839
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:10,000
blasting it does not hurt you for the campaign to be an equally viable option for the people

2840
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:20,000
that want to play this game what's the problem and guys some people say racks your solution is

2841
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:28,000
really lame you just beat the campaign you ding 60 and you get a goodie bag yeah i mean that's

2842
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:35,000
pretty lame that's not as good as them redefining the whole campaign and putting in special loot

2843
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:43,000
drops to align and making it perfect but the entire point of why you wouldn't get this change

2844
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:51,000
is the dev time opportunity cost right it takes a million years to fix that whereas

2845
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:57,000
if they just did a gooey bag and made you ding a certain level then they could implement it maybe

2846
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:05,000
in a day and then they can fix it later right now you're not going to get night now if you do the

2847
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:10,000
campaign you don't get anything you don't get jack shit you don't get any xp and you don't get anything

2848
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:14,000
it's a huge huge not even close to helltide

2849
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:26,000
stop wasting time on meaningless garbage jesus the game has much bigger problems than this

2850
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
some of you guys

2851
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:34,000
some of you guys

2852
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:40,000
i know fourth grade was hard

2853
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:50,000
it's it's hard to cover a lot of different ideas and aspects of a topic

2854
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:54,000
i know that that can get really complicated for some people

2855
02:44:54,000 --> 02:45:01,000
i can see the smoke coming out of some of their ears from all the way over here

2856
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:12,000
that's why i'm saying fussy that's why i i included this portion to expedite the campaign

2857
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:16,000
on a replay a little bit we don't have to walk the camel again

2858
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:26,000
wait there's a fourth grade after fifth grade fourth grade is coming man and for some of the

2859
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:33,000
people in chat it's where their journey ended

2860
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
you

2861
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
you

2862
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
you

2863
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
you

2864
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
you

2865
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
you

2866
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
you

2867
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
you

2868
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
you

2869
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
you

2870
02:45:53,000 --> 02:46:18,000
you

2871
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
you

2872
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:21,000
you

2873
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
you

2874
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
you

2875
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:30,000
they should have an uber fight of the camel and you have to walk him across the desert

2876
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:31,000
in it's kind of like

2877
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:37,000
like a mario kart race and the timing is really really precise you need like frame perfect inputs

2878
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
to get the camel to turn left and right

2879
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:40,000
you

2880
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
you

2881
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,000
you

2882
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:44,000
you

2883
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,000
you

2884
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:46,000
yeah

2885
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:49,000
and there needs to be landmines

2886
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
and

2887
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:57,000
there needs to be landmines and if you successfully beat it then you unlock a key

2888
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:04,000
to go into the catacombs to fight uber tomb lord and uber tomb lords mount is the camel

2889
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:29,000
the interview is already over yeah if you

2890
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:30,000
if you blinked it's uh

2891
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
if you blinked it's uh

2892
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:36,000
it's already over

2893
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:39,000
rob just sent me a clip i don't know what this is let's just click it

2894
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,000
so we ended up putting it in a place where uh like the tier 200 pit is

2895
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:54,000
like okay it's like like around tier 150 pit is like close to where aoz was you know for like tier 25 uh uh a aoz yeah aoz

2896
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,000
That is insane.

2897
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Oh my god, thank you so much, Ryan.

2898
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Yes.

2899
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Oh boy.

2900
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:08,000
W.

2901
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:12,000
150 pit is tier 25 Aoz.

2902
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:14,000
Let's go.

2903
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
We have a real endgame.

2904
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Dang.

2905
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Suck them harder, Rax.

2906
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Finally, guys.

2907
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Of the Neath Iron that you need to kind of start finishing off your Masterwork items.

2908
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
And then that gets more and more efficient as you go deeper and deeper.

2909
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
You know, but there's a...

2910
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
But we do want to have these like really, really difficult...

2911
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:36,000
So we ended up putting it in a place where like the tier 200 pit...

2912
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:48,000
If the Barb is happy, then we're happy.

2913
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:04,000
We got a message from Adam Fletcher.

2914
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I know that you had a ton of additional stuff.

2915
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Maybe we can do this again sooner rather than later.

2916
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:13,000
And we can hit up even more of your questions.

2917
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:18,000
All right.

2918
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:18,000
All right.

2919
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:21,000
I mean...

2920
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,000
I mean...

2921
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,000
I got questions.

2922
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:26,000
I can come up with another 100 questions.

2923
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Adam to save the day.

2924
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Rob probably loves the camel.

2925
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,000
He better not.

2926
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,000
He better not.

2927
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Okay.

2928
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Should I call Adam and Joe?

2929
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Be like, are you guys free later?

2930
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Let's go again.

2931
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Part two.

2932
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Okay.

2933
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:30,000
I didn't know this.

2934
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
It's Rob's birthday today.

2935
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Five, nine, huh?

2936
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:35,000
It's his birthday.

2937
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:35,000
Okay.

2938
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:47,000
31.

2939
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,000
That's one foot in the grave.

2940
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Should I just...

2941
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:59,000
When DM's interview starts, should I call them?

2942
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Be like, what?

2943
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
No, you guys got your schedules confused.

2944
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
This interview was my interview part two.

2945
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,000
DM's is later.

2946
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,000
They'll be like, oh, okay.

2947
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
And then DM's going to be like, what the hell?

2948
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,000
No, I'm just kidding.

2949
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,000
I'll just send DM my questions.

2950
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:13,000
He'll do a good job.

2951
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Okay.

2952
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Excuse me.

2953
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:19,000
I'm 34.

2954
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:21,000
How are you even alive?

2955
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
I'm 37, by the way.

2956
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,000
There's DM right there.

2957
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Please no.

2958
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:29,000
DM.

2959
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:31,000
I'm sure you have a list of questions.

2960
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Would you like a...

2961
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Would you like another list of questions that I didn't get to get to?

2962
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:38,000
To add to your list?

2963
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Dude, 45 minutes, man.

2964
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Is not enough time.

2965
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Send them your way.

2966
02:51:58,000 --> 02:51:59,000
You'll carry the torch.

2967
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:00,000
All right.

2968
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,000
I'm going to fix this document.

2969
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:03,000
In fact, I'm going to do it right now.

2970
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I already asked this.

2971
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,000
I already asked this.

2972
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Well, let me do it this way.

2973
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
I already asked about aspirational content.

2974
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:18,000
I already asked them about the roadmap.

2975
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:24,000
I already asked them about feedback.

2976
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:27,000
I already asked them about the state of nightmare dungeons.

2977
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:33,000
I already asked them about the overworld future.

2978
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:35,000
I asked them about the pit.

2979
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
I didn't ask them this.

2980
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:42,000
So these are all done.

2981
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I already asked those.

2982
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:53,000
This was kind of asked already.

2983
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:56,000
I wanted to prod at them deeper, but...

2984
02:52:57,000 --> 02:53:03,000
I'm just going to delete this question.

2985
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
I'm not sure if DM was aware of this.

2986
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Maybe this question doesn't make any sense anymore.

2987
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:12,000
I'm just going to delete it.

2988
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Charms.

2989
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:13,000
This is a good one.

2990
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:15,000
So that's a good one to ask.

2991
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:18,000
All right.

2992
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:19,000
So I already asked.

2993
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:25,000
I asked all of these.

2994
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:34,000
So this is all.

2995
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I already asked this.

2996
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:39,000
I already asked this.

2997
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Didn't ask that.

2998
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:44,000
I would love.

2999
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
I want to know this.

3000
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:50,000
I want to know what their target audience is for Diablo 4.

3001
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
This is already listed above.

3002
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Okay.

3003
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:02,000
Yeah, here you go.

3004
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:04,000
Anything in...

3005
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:10,000
Anything in orange I already asked.

3006
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
CJ had some extra questions as well.

3007
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Okay.

3008
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Okay.

3009
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
So let me share this with DM here.

3010
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:54,000
All right.

3011
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:57,000
There you go, man.

3012
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:00,000
He has it.

3013
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:01,000
There you go.

3014
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:01,000
There you go.

3015
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Yeah.

3016
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
That's another question I should have asked.

3017
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Why is everything red?

3018
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
I asked about the armory.

3019
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
And they gave me like a little smile.

3020
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,000
And they said,

3021
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
we like the idea of the armory.

3022
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
And we know people want it.

3023
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:32,000
That's usually their cutie patootie way of saying that it's probably maybe coming soon.

3024
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Like maybe season five.

3025
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
How am I feeling about the pit difficulty?

3026
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Yeah.

3027
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Like I said live on the interview,

3028
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:55,000
if tier 25 is 150 and 200 is beyond abattoir tier 25 with the bug fixes and with the balance changes,

3029
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:59,000
that should be in theory extremely difficult.

3030
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:15,000
When will North war release his guides?

3031
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
I know he has a lot of guides to work on.

3032
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,000
I don't know the exact timing,

3033
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:21,000
but I do know that.

3034
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Don't know the exact timing,

3035
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:27,000
but I do know that the Maxwell people have been blasting.

3036
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:30,000
So obviously before the season comes out on Tuesday,

3037
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:35,000
the Maxwell team has been blasting to get the D4 guides out.

3038
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Please tell me I will not be playing hardcore in Diablo 4.

3039
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:48,000
I'm 1000% going hardcore SSF.

3040
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:52,000
And it is very, very likely that I will die.

3041
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Very likely.

3042
02:56:55,000 --> 02:57:00,000
I did a couple of practice runs on the PTR with the no cheat death changes.

3043
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
I did not survive a single run.

3044
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:04,000
I died on every single time.

3045
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:06,000
And I'm,

3046
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
I know Diablo 4 pretty well.

3047
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:12,000
You want to know another cute thing about me playing hardcore next season?

3048
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
I have never fought an Uber boss.

3049
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
I've never fought Uber and Dario.

3050
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
I've never fought Uber.

3051
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Uh,

3052
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,000
I don't even know their names.

3053
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Lightning man.

3054
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:24,000
I never fought Uber.

3055
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:25,000
Zier.

3056
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:27,000
I've never fought them.

3057
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,000
Not even one time to test them.

3058
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:33,000
No,

3059
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:33,000
I,

3060
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:33,000
I,

3061
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:33,000
I,

3062
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:34,000
I,

3063
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:34,000
I fought.

3064
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Is there a 200 version of Durial?

3065
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:39,000
As well?

3066
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Okay.

3067
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:46,000
I,

3068
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:46,000
I,

3069
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
I will almost certainly die.

3070
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:52,000
I didn't survive one speed run in the PTR.

3071
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:53,000
I died on every single one.

3072
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Um,

3073
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
um,

3074
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
I'm probably going to play.

3075
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:59,000
I'm well,

3076
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:00,000
first of all,

3077
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:00,000
I'll,

3078
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
I'll play every class.

3079
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Cause again,

3080
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:03,000
I mean,

3081
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,000
I've said this like five times a day,

3082
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:05,000
but I'm a loser.

3083
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:09,000
So I'll play everything except maybe rogue,

3084
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
but maybe I'll play rogue too.

3085
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Um,

3086
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:16,000
I'm probably going to start necro.

3087
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:17,000
I haven't started necro.

3088
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:23,000
I don't know if I've ever started necro and I really want to play with the minions.

3089
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:25,000
I think the minions are going to be fun as hell.

3090
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:28,000
Why not rogue?

3091
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Cause rogue didn't get many like exciting changes.

3092
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:46,000
I tried several less speed leveling things and I died on every single one of them.

3093
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
I hate minions.

3094
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
It's not that I hate minions.

3095
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:05,000
It's I hate minions where I'm a babysitter and not the commander of the undead.

3096
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:09,000
If my minions are dumb as hell and not,

3097
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:12,000
and I have to do a ton of things to make them do anything,

3098
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:13,000
then yes,

3099
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:14,000
I hate minions.

3100
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:23,000
What time is DM's interview?

3101
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:24,000
I don't know.

3102
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Uh,

3103
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
he tweeted it,

3104
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:28,000
didn't he?

3105
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:31,000
I'm such a Twitter noob.

3106
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
I don't even know how to look people up here.

3107
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Um,

3108
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:37,000
search search.

3109
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:38,000
Darth

3110
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:41,000
micro here.

3111
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:47,000
1 p.m.

3112
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:47,000
Pacific.

3113
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:51,000
1 p.m.

3114
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Pacific.

3115
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:53,000
Pacific.

3116
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:53,000
So,

3117
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
exactly 24 hours from now.

3118
02:59:58,000 --> 02:59:59,000
I believe.

3119
02:59:59,000 --> 02:59:59,000
I believe.

3120
02:59:59,000 --> 02:59:59,000
I believe.

3121
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:34,000
am I hype for May 14th?

3122
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:35,000
I am.

3123
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:35,000
It's going to be fun.

3124
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:36,000
I,

3125
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:37,000
I'm almost certainly going to die,

3126
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:39,000
but I don't care.

3127
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:40,000
I'll just make another character.

3128
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:40,000
We go again.

3129
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I believe.

3130
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I believe.

3131
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I believe.

3132
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I believe.

3133
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I believe.

3134
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I believe.

3135
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I believe.

3136
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I believe.

3137
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:42,000
I believe.

3138
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:42,000
I believe.

3139
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:42,000
I believe.

3140
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:42,000
I believe.

3141
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:43,000
I believe.

3142
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:43,000
I believe.

3143
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:43,000
I believe.

3144
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:53,000
you watched the interview already a second time.

3145
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:54,000
I was too hard for myself.

3146
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:55,000
My phrasing was well done.

3147
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:56,000
Thanks for saying that,

3148
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:56,000
man.

3149
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:58,000
Appreciate it.

3150
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Yeah,

3151
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:05,000
I just,

3152
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:06,000
I just didn't.

3153
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Time was the limiting factor there.

3154
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Yeah.

3155
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Is there any need to keep aspects on old characters to migrate them over to the new system in season four?

3156
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:24,000
Keep in mind,

3157
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:24,000
the,

3158
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:27,000
the new system is very seamless,

3159
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:28,000
right?

3160
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:29,000
You run around,

3161
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:30,000
you pick up legendaries.

3162
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Okay.

3163
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:31,000
You take a look.

3164
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
If it's not better than yours,

3165
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:33,000
essentially,

3166
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:34,000
if it doesn't have a greater ethics,

3167
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:35,000
you just salvage it.

3168
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:36,000
It's just going to chain.

3169
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:40,000
It's just going to start chain upgrading your codex of power seamlessly.

3170
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:46,000
I don't think you need to save stuff and salvage it and anything like that.

3171
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:50,000
I think you just play and your codex is going to get filled out pretty easily.

3172
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:54,000
Yeah,

3173
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:55,000
that's,

3174
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,000
that's a good way to phrase it.

3175
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:57,000
The,

3176
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:07,000
one of the biggest values there is the humanizing of the blizzard entity or the Diablo four entity.

3177
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:11,000
You get to speak to the people in plain English.

3178
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:12,000
The,

3179
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:13,000
the,

3180
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:14,000
the real advantage here,

3181
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:21,000
the difference between this and a campfire chat for me is they are willing to just sit there and say,

3182
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:24,000
what is the community want to talk about?

3183
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:31,000
And I tried to make my questions a little bit pointed.

3184
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:35,000
If I leave the question super open ended,

3185
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:38,000
then we can get a very,

3186
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:41,000
very high level glazing of ideas.

3187
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:43,000
But if I say,

3188
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:47,000
I want to talk to you about pinnacle content.

3189
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:48,000
You said,

3190
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
this didn't work.

3191
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:51,000
You said,

3192
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:58,000
this is going to be a bigger factor than X is going to be a bigger factor than Y.

3193
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:03,000
Have you considered Z specifically for this content?

3194
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:07,000
And what does the team think about that?

3195
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:12,000
Then we can start to dig at what are we actually getting at here?

3196
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:13,000
Right.

3197
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
When you leave it very open,

3198
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:29,000
it's not even like a,

3199
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:30,000
it's not even like a negative,

3200
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:33,000
but when you leave it,

3201
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
when you leave a topic wide open,

3202
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:41,000
they will respond similarly to how they have always responded.

3203
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:41,000
Right.

3204
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:43,000
If I say,

3205
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:46,000
what did you guys think about the PTR?

3206
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
They have already said a hundred times.

3207
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
We really liked the PTR.

3208
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
We got so much feedback.

3209
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:56,000
Thank you for participating on the PTR.

3210
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:58,000
Okay.

3211
03:03:58,000 --> 03:03:59,000
But I could ask them,

3212
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:07,000
what kind of feedback from the PTR seemed to be the most valuable to you?

3213
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:07,000
What,

3214
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:14,000
what kinds of things surprised you when you started to concatenate the data and

3215
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
start to make some decisions about it?

3216
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:19,000
That's better.

3217
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
Like we're actually going to learn something out of it.

3218
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:26,000
Racks plays soft course.

3219
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
You can do community Durial and Endarial runs.

3220
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
The problem is,

3221
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:36,000
the problem is,

3222
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:36,000
is,

3223
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
um,

3224
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:41,000
when I,

3225
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:42,000
if I do that,

3226
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:47,000
whenever I have ever done a community run,

3227
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:51,000
I have always required myself to pay my own way.

3228
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
Unless someone comes into my stream and says,

3229
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:54,000
Racks,

3230
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:54,000
I'm,

3231
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:55,000
I'm literally quitting.

3232
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:56,000
I'm going to go play.

3233
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Wow.

3234
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:57,000
Season of discovery.

3235
03:04:58,000 --> 03:04:59,000
If you want my 50 mats,

3236
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:00,000
you can take them.

3237
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:00,000
If not,

3238
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:01,000
they're going to rot in my chest.

3239
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:02,000
Okay.

3240
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:03,000
If you're actually quitting,

3241
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:04,000
whatever,

3242
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:05,000
I'll take them.

3243
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:06,000
But in general,

3244
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:09,000
if I just log in,

3245
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
what you guys will do,

3246
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
because you guys are so nice,

3247
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:20,000
is you guys will pay for me to run Durial 10,000 times until I have every Uber unique,

3248
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:22,000
because you're very nice.

3249
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
But if I do that,

3250
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:28,000
I'm missing the most important thing about my stream.

3251
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:30,000
And as a player,

3252
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:33,000
I miss being relatable.

3253
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:39,000
If I just use streamer privilege to just get handed everything,

3254
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:40,000
first of all,

3255
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:43,000
the game is boring because I didn't earn anything.

3256
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:44,000
And the second thing is,

3257
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:45,000
is I'm not relatable.

3258
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
You guys don't have,

3259
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:52,000
a lot of you don't have a thousand million people that are willing to just hand it.

3260
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:58,000
So when you're trying content and you have a stick and I have Excalibur,

3261
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:00,000
it's not relatable.

3262
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:07,000
So that's why I,

3263
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,000
I don't do that.

3264
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:12,000
Or if I participate in community events,

3265
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:12,000
events,

3266
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:16,000
I pay my own way every time.

3267
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:27,000
Am I not trying to be Rob?

3268
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:28,000
Guys,

3269
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:28,000
I'm not,

3270
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:31,000
I'm not needling Rob or people are saying Asmogold.

3271
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:37,000
I'm not giving this answer to disrespect other people or their decisions.

3272
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
I was asked a question.

3273
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:42,000
I'm responding to the answer for me.

3274
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:46,000
They can do whatever they want.

3275
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Interview already happened.

3276
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Here's an interesting thing.

3277
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:10,000
Lee just made this.

3278
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:14,000
This is going to be the timestamps of the interview on YouTube.

3279
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:15,000
Let's look,

3280
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:20,000
but this is interesting because let's look at the time spent on each topic.

3281
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:21,000
I mean,

3282
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
half the problem is,

3283
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:24,000
is this question had a lot of setup.

3284
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:28,000
I spend at least one minute setting up the question from CJ's interview.

3285
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:31,000
So let's say about four,

3286
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:32,000
four minutes on roadmap,

3287
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:36,000
about four minutes on pitical content,

3288
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:37,000
four minutes on roadmap,

3289
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:42,000
11 minutes on feedback from the community.

3290
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:43,000
Wow.

3291
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:45,000
11 minutes.

3292
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:56,000
We spent one,

3293
03:07:56,000 --> 03:08:02,000
we spent one fourth of the time talking about how they process feedback and how they test the game.

3294
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:08,000
Armory,

3295
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,000
42 seconds.

3296
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:14,000
This was the rapid fire thing though.

3297
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:23,000
You got to talk faster.

3298
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,000
Speed run questions.

3299
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:25,000
I mean,

3300
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:26,000
I was trying,

3301
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:26,000
man.

3302
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:28,000
I was trying.

3303
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,000
I wasn't yapping fast enough.

3304
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
What stood out the most?

3305
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:47,000
Probably,

3306
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
probably the feedback section.

3307
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:53,000
The fact that they said that they build in time for all the developers to play the game,

3308
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:54,000
to learn the game.

3309
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:56,000
I would say that's,

3310
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
that was the best news for me out of all of it.

3311
03:08:59,000 --> 03:08:59,000
But I,

3312
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:00,000
that,

3313
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:02,000
I think that let's do one more poll.

3314
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
I don't want to become a poll Andy.

3315
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:07,000
But I,

3316
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:08,000
I do have a question.

3317
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:09,000
Let's,

3318
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:10,000
for those that watch the interview,

3319
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:11,000
let's see.

3320
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:17,000
What was the best information about,

3321
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:18,000
or from the interview?

3322
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:22,000
The devs,

3323
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:23,000
the devs,

3324
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:28,000
play the game every day.

3325
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:31,000
What are some other choices?

3326
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:33,000
The,

3327
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:34,000
the pit actually having difficulty.

3328
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:36,000
Yeah.

3329
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:38,000
Pit actually difficult.

3330
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:41,000
Yeah.

3331
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:46,000
The overworld being dead.

3332
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:47,000
Yeah.

3333
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
It sounded like an armory is coming.

3334
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
Armory coming.

3335
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:54,000
We think.

3336
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:56,000
Kind of.

3337
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
Paper towels next to the bed.

3338
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:14,000
Good.

3339
03:10:19,000 --> 03:10:19,000
Good.

3340
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:20,000
Good.

3341
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:21,000
Good.

3342
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:22,000
By.

3343
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:23,000
Good.

3344
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:23,000
Good.

3345
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:23,000
Good.

3346
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:24,000
Good.

3347
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:25,000
Good.

3348
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:25,000
Good.

3349
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Good.

3350
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Good.

3351
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Good.

3352
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:27,000
Good.

3353
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:28,000
Good.

3354
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:28,000
Good.

3355
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:28,000
Good.

3356
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:29,000
Both.

3357
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:29,000
Good.

3358
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:30,000
Good.

3359
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:41,000
Yeah, they actually feedback listened to from all sources.

3360
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:42,000
I mean, that's good enough.

3361
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:43,000
We don't have to fish for these.

3362
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:46,000
Let's just go with this.

3363
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:51,000
Which of these four did you say was the best news out of these four choices?

3364
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:56,000
I spam the poll in the chat if you care to answer.

3365
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:17,000
All right, so what I'm gathering from this is people are excited about different things.

3366
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:37,000
It's a little bit more balanced than I thought it was going to be.

3367
03:11:37,000 --> 03:12:05,000
VPN user voting is not allowed.

3368
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:08,000
I wonder why that is.

3369
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:12,000
Is that because they don't want you to vote a million times because you can just keep

3370
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:15,000
picking different sources or what?

3371
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:18,000
Why would they block that?

3372
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:21,000
It's like to protect the integrity of the poll or something?

3373
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:58,000
Why would they block that?

3374
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:07,000
devs play the game every day is not a best info that is their obligation

3375
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:15,000
i don't know if every gaming studio blocks out a certain portion of their day every day to just

3376
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:20,000
play the game i wouldn't say that's let's say an obligation is a stretch but i'm glad that they do

3377
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:23,000
it obligation is a is a stretch

3378
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:35,000
well jesse did the did the people actually think that the devs don't play the game

3379
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:42,000
i don't think i think most people thought that the devs play the game but there's a huge difference

3380
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:52,000
between playing the game and your entire dev team as part of their daily job plays 50 hours of the

3381
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:56,000
new season each before releasing it to the public

3382
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:01,000
i think that's not those are not the same thing

3383
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:14,000
i was not expecting that

3384
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:27,000
what is ssf solo self found you mean

3385
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:35,000
all right um there's so many people here i would love to just blast all day but i actually think

3386
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:40,000
i'm gonna relax a little bit i was gonna keep i could stream all day guys but i think i'm gonna

3387
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:45,000
think i'm gonna wrap it up here and i'm gonna raid rob because it's his birthday so let's raid rob

3388
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:50,000
wish him happy birthday and see what see what he thinks really appreciated you guys being here you

3389
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:58,000
guys left a lot of comments i took the top five comments on youtube and i blocked out time to ask

3390
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:05,000
your questions so the the probably the most insulting thing the thing that pisses me off that

3391
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:10,000
people talk shit about me all the time and that's fine you're a streamer that's what's gonna happen

3392
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:17,000
the one thing that pisses me off the most is when people say that i don't care about the community

3393
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:23,000
i don't represent the community in any way i don't give a shit about the casuals i only care about the

3394
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:33,000
blasters it's complete horse shit that's why i let you guys post all of your questions and i when i'm

3395
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:42,000
running out of time i asked every single one of your top five questions i didn't do it as a pr move

3396
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:48,000
i did it to make sure that your questions got answered so that's the thing that if you really

3397
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:54,000
want to piss me off is saying something like that to me one guy no it happens a lot my friend trust me

3398
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:59,000
you wouldn't believe how much people talk shit about me but you're not going to focus on that today was a

3399
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:08,000
great day um but remember this for all the people that say i don't care i asked the top five questions

3400
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:11,000
from youtube and i i didn't have an opportunity to ask many questions

3401
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:27,000
is rob still streaming yeah okay thank you so much guys i appreciate it um tomorrow i'll probably play

3402
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:34,000
diablo 4 i haven't played in a long time i mean i'll be honest with you the the the five-year-old

3403
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:42,000
in me just wants to keep playing elden ring but i'll probably play diablo 4 um might theory craft some

3404
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:50,000
things might look at some max roll builds need to make a tier list

3405
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:57,000
it's it's it's just so hard to say man it's so hard to say that the tier list i'm gonna make it

3406
03:16:57,000 --> 03:17:04,000
just because people like the video but it's so hard to say i'll see you tomorrow frosty frosty

3407
